<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-53">A LOST AND FOUND HORARY <br/>BY A MASTER PRACTITIONER</p>
<p class="txni">Astrologer Gary Price, who has been practicing horary for decades, kindly gave me permission to reproduce one of his charts, which appeared in the first edition of Price’s <span class="ital">The Horary Practioner</span> back in 1989. His analysis is brief and to the point and serves as an excellent teaching example for students of the art. Currently Gary is writing a book on horary with an emphasis on predicting the outcome of games and competitions. The following is Gary’s horary delineation verbatim. </p>
<p class="Q1">After searching over two hours for a receipt for an item my wife and I were buying, I decided to draw a horary chart and consulted Lilly to see what he had to say about hidden or mislaid things [chart 49]. Here is what I found.</p>
<p class="Q2">If you find the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler in any angle, the missing item is within the querent’s house (<span class="ital">CA</span> 202). If the Moon is with the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house ruler in the same quarter of heaven and no more than one sign separates them, the lost item is in the home o<span class="CharOverride-4">f</span> the person who lost it (<span class="ital">CA</span> 320).</p>
<p class="Q2">Jupiter rules the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house and is angular [in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house] in Gemini, a sign representing west by south (<span class="ital">CA</span> 204). Jupiter rules the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house as well as the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, making him doubly important because the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house governs misplaced things.</p>
<p class="Q2">The Moon is in Pisces, a northwest sign. Jupiter is angular in the western hemisphere, so I concluded that mislaid receipt was west. Mercury, the natural ruler of papers, disposes Jupiter and occupies Libra, a western sign. The majority of significators in air and fire signs led me to conclude the object was aboveground; fiery signs show near a wall or partition (<span class="ital">CA</span> 204).</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"></a>Chart 49: Gary Price: Where Is the Missing Receipt? <br/>25 September 1988, 10:40 a.m. GMT (11:40 a.m. BST), London. Sun day, Saturn hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 25<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 24' Cancer.</p>
<p class="Q2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page377" title="377"></span>If you find the Moon applying to the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house ruler, or to the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ruler from the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>, or to the Moon’s dispositor, the missing thing will be found again (<span class="ital">CA</span> 319). The Moon, although void of course [by the modern definition], still performs in Pisces and applies, after changing signs, to Mars, who rules both the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> and 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (<span class="ital">CA</span> 89). If the Moon’s dispositor is in a human sign, it is in a place frequented by people (<span class="ital">CA</span> 320). Jupiter, which disposes the Moon, is in Gemini, a human sign. In addition, Jupiter is Retrograde, showing a return.</p>
<p class="Q2">The 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house ruler Mars last separated from Saturn (when Mars was in Pisces). That means the thing was lost through forgetfulness (<span class="ital">CA</span> 321). I pondered this for a clue as to what I was doing when I misplaced it. The only activity I could remember was astrology, and the receipt could be among my books, but I have so many. The <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>est wall has many books on its shelves. Rather than search through them all, I decided to approach the chart from a different angle. There are two fireplaces along the west wall, one a gas fire in the living room, the other a radiator in the bedroom. I decided to check the books next to the radiator in the bedroom, as I had placed some astrology books there after studying. Among the books was a small, multi-colored notepad with alternating red, white, yellow, and blue pages. Tucked away in the red pages was the receipt. The books were on a stack of other books, high up off the floor. Mars rules the color red, and Mercury rules multi-colored things. Mars rules the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> of bedrooms and the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> of pleasure. Most of my astrology reading takes place in the bedroom. (Price 1989, 22)</p>
<p class="Ahead">A Note on the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Part in Price’s “Missing Receipt” Horary</p>
<p class="txni">Although Gary Price did not use 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> parts in his delineation, let’s consider what the <span class="ital">dwad</span> of the Ascendant might have indicated to the astrologer. The Ascendant at 22<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 07' Scorpio has its 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part at 25<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 24' Cancer in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Regiomontanus house, which can signify things that are lost, dead, “lying obscurely,” or concealed from view (<span class="ital">CA</span> 470). Cancer is <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Whole Sign from the Ascendant, so the querent may have a matter related to book<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> or higher learning on his mind. There are no visible planets in Cancer, which makes the placement of Cancer’s ruler, the Moon, highly significant. The Moon lies in Pisces in th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of home, family, and mislaid things. The Moon’s most recent aspect to a visibl<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> planet was a square to Saturn in Sagittarius in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> Regiomontanus house. The Moon’s separation from Saturn indicates concern about having forgotten where he put something (<span class="ital">CA</span> 321), and the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house refers to purchases and movable goods. If we string together the keywords, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page378" title="378"></span>we can guess that the following issues were on the querent’s mind when he asked the question:</p>
<p class="list1">• 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house—things “lying obscurely”</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bl2">9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house—books, higher learning</li>
<li class="Bl2">4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house—home, family, things mislaid</li>
<li class="Bl2">2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house—purchases and movable goods</li>
<li class="Bl2">Moon most recently separating from Saturn—something misplaced due to carelessness, distraction, or forgetfulness<p class="contents _idGenParaOverride-4"><a href="Contents.html">[contents]</a></p></li>
</ul>
