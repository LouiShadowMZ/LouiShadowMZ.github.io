<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-18">THE TWELVE HOUSES/PLACES: <br/>ATTRIBUTIONS AND LOCATIONS</p>
<p class="txni">Horary depends on locating the querent and the quesited in the proper house of the horoscope. To find a missing object, you need to decide which houses and planets signify what you are looking for and where it might be found. For example, the planet that rules the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house signifies one’s movable possessions, and the Moon is a universal signifier of fugitives, stray animals, and lost or missing items. A word of caution from C.C. Zain is in order here: </p>
<p class="Q4">Probably the most common source of error in horary astrology is a failure to select the house to which the question properly belongs. … I cannot emphasize to<span class="CharOverride-4">o</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>trongly the necessity for reformulating the question, so that the true significance is at once apparent and it can be assigned to its proper house. (Zain 1969, 119–120)</p>
<p class="tx">The reader should bear in mind that early Hellenistic authors used Whole Sign <span class="ital">places</span>, referred to as <span class="ital">t</span><span lang="ar-SA" xml:lang="ar-SA">ó</span><span class="ital">poi</span>, to signify various topics around the wheel. As horary astrology evolved, the Arabic and Persian astrologers gradually switched to quadrant houses, such as Alcabitius, to define topics in horary charts. By the time of William Lilly in the seventeenth century, the Regiomontanus house system was the predominant method of house division in Western Europe. </p>
<p class="tx">Nonetheless, Morinus, a French contemporary of Lilly, utilized Whole Sign <span class="ital">places (topoi), </span>which he called “accidental houses,” together with Regiomontanus quadrant houses to delineate charts in much the same way that modern Jyotish astrologers use quadrant house cusps as sensitive points within a Whole Sign house system. For example, if the significator of a lost object falls in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house or conjoins the ruler of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, the item might be found with the spouse of the querent. Additionally, if the significator falls in the second sign within the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house rather than in the sign on its cusp, then the missing item may be where the wife stores her goods or valuables (e.g., her pocketbook, bureau, travel case, etc.).</p>

<p class="Ahead">Location of Missing Items and Angularity</p>
<p class="txni">Think of angularity as being similar to the volume knob on a radio or the brightness control of a computer monitor. <span class="ital">Angular</span> implies high volume and maximum visibility (you can’t miss it); <span class="ital">succedent</span>, having medium volume and moderate visibility (noticeable but not overwhelming); and finally <span class="ital">cadent</span>, of low volume or visibility (far away, in a different location, or barely noticeable). Within an individual house, the planets closest to the cusp are <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he “loudest” or “brightest” within that house, and planets closer to the cusp of the subs<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span>quent house have proportionately lower volume or visibility with respect to the house that they occupy.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page109" title="109"></span>In traditional astrology, the angles of the chart are pivotal turning points. Acting like the four stakes that securely anchor the corners of a rectangular tent to the ground, th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> angular houses provide basic structure to the chart. The angular houses are the most fundamental and prominent ones in the native’s life. By the primary motion of the heavens, the succedent houses move toward the angular ones, and the cadent houses fall away (or <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ravel away) from the angles.</p>
<p class="tx">By analogy, in horary astrology, a significator in an angular house implies a location that is visible and fundamental to the life of the querent: a commonly frequented place i<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he querent’s home, workplace, or community. A succedent house suggests a less visible location not far from, but approaching, the querent; for example, an adjacent room or building close to the querent’s home. A cadent (falling away) house suggests a hard-to-see location that may be at some distance or moving away from the querent; the missing item may have fallen somewhere, be concealed behind something, or been involved in travel to another location.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Angular Houses</p>
<p class="txni">If the significator of the missing item is angular, then the item is probably in the home, close to home, with the querent, in the querent’s car, or in some other location that the querent frequents. It will often be quickly and easily found, and it may in a place where it is usually kept. Planets in angular houses tend to be more visible, “louder,” and more pronounced in the life of the querent.</p>
<p class="tx">Angular equivalent: If the significator of the missing item, or the Moon, lies within one sign’s length (30 degrees) of the Ascendant ruler (querent’s significator), then the lost <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>bject may be in the querent’s home or close to the querent, especially if the two planets <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>ccupy the same quadrant of the chart.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Succedent Houses</p>
<p class="txni">If the significator of the missing item lies in a succedent house, then it is nearby but not as visible or as close to the querent as it would be if the house were angular, and it will be more difficult or take longer to find. Additionally, if the planetary ruler of the term, or bound, of the Moon occupies a succedent house, then the item is not far away from the querent (Puotinen 1989, 9).</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page110" title="110"></span>Cadent Houses</p>
<p class="txni">If the significator of the missing item is in a cadent house, then the item may be at some distance or far away from the querent rather than in the querent’s home. Traditionally th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> cadent houses are associated with travel or a change of location. The significator of a missing item in a cadent house means that its location is not obvious. It may be difficult to see or may have been unintentionally or deliberately concealed and may thus take a long tim<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> to find. Often the querent will need to look in the same place more than once or mak<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> many inquiries to find the missing item. It could lie behind, beneath, or within something, and it may have fallen from the person of the querent to its current location. </p>
<p class="tx">Because the cadent houses are associated with travel, the missing item may be in a vehicle (for example, having fallen from the querent’s pocket while driving) or possibly in a suitcase, the trunk of a car, or with things associated with travel and transport. The sought-for object could also have been found by someone who then transported it to a new location.</p>
<p class="tx">When discussing where to locate a 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house person whom you wish to speak with and who is not a blood relative, Lilly writes the following:</p>
<p class="Q4">If the Lord of the 7th house be in any of the four Angles, you may conclude the Party is at home with whom you would speak with; but if the Lord of the seventh, or Lord of that house from whom the judgment is required, be in a succedent house, <span class="ital">viz</span>., the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, then he is not far from home; but if his <span class="ital">significator</span> be in a cadent house, then he is far from home. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 147)</p>
<p class="tx">In short, the location of the significator of the missing person or thing in the chart gives a clue to its location in the world:</p>
<p class="list1">• <span class="ital">Angular:</span> At home (or, metaphorically, very easy to find, regardless of its location)</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> <span class="ital">Succedent:</span> Not far from the home (or, metaphorically, somewhat difficult to find, perhaps because it is concealed behind or within something)</p>
<p class="list3">• <span class="ital">Cadent:</span> Far from home (or, metaphorically, difficult to find, even if it is in the home)</p>
<p class="tx">When using these guidelines, remember that Lilly used Regiomontanus houses and judged the influence of planets on houses as if the <span class="ital">entrance to each astrological house were five degrees before its cusp</span>. Thus, if the Midheaven was at 14<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Leo, the entrance to the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> hous<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> would be imagined to lie at 9<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Leo. It is <span class="ital">as if</span> the cusp of the house were the point of maximum intensity for the significations of that house and acted like a fixed star with an orb <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page111" title="111"></span>of 5 degrees. Lilly sometimes uses <span class="ital">aspects to the cusp of a house</span> in his delineations. Not all astrologers follow this 5-degree rule, and Hellenistic astrologers use Whole Sign houses, in which the boundaries between the signs are the entrances to the houses.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Planets in Aversion to (Inconjunct) the Houses They Rule</p>
<p class="txni">Ben Dykes, in his book on <span class="ital">Traditional Astrology</span>, says the following: “When a planet is in aversion to a sign that it rules: it means that there is some disconnect, some estrangement, ignorance, not seeing or not being seen. In some contexts, it can even mean travel (i.e., not being present) or acting without much information” (Dykes 2011, 68). Thus, in studying the houses in horary, it is worthwhile to pay attention to the ruler of the sign on the cusp and determine whether it makes a major Whole Sign aspect to the house that it rules. If there is no major or Ptolemaic aspect, then the planet is “in aversion” to the house that it rules and the following keywords may apply:</p>
<p class="list1">• Disconnected or unconnected</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Not seeing; unseen, not able to be seen</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Estranged or exiled</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Unregulated, doing its own thing</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Averse, askew, asunder, turned away</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Being caught unaware </p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Lacking information, uninformed or misinformed</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Not communicating; misunderstanding</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Out of sight, out of touch, out of mind</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Not present (absent); in a different location</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Traveling or at a distance</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Acting on impulse or with insufficient forethought</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Not as desired or anticipated</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Not managing the affairs of the house well</p>
<p class="Ahead">The Quincunx “Aspect”</p>
<p class="txni">Technically speaking, the quincunx is not a classic astrological aspect, because planets in quincunx are 150 degrees apart and cannot “see” each other. In horary, however, the qui<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span>cunx has similar meanings to the list above regarding signs “in aversion.” In addition, pla<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span>ets <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page112" title="112"></span>in quincunx are either six or eight houses apart, so themes of illness, bodily ailments, loss, anxiety, etc., may also be part of the picture. </p>
<p class="tx">Regarding missing objects, when the querent’s significator applies to <span class="ital">quincunx</span> the planet that rules the missing item, it implies that the querent is unable to see the missing thing, perhaps because it is out of sight, askew, hidden from view, or in a different location, or perhaps due to the querent traveling from one place to another. This situation often arises when the item being sought has been inadvertently forgotten or left in the querent’s <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>utomobile.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Significators and Consignificators of Houses</p>
<p class="txni">Generally speaking, the planet ruling the sign on the house cusp is the significator of that house. The planet that rules the Ascendant signifies the querent. The planet that rules the sign on the cusp of the house of the quesited is the significator of the quesited.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly also assigns <span class="ital">consignificators</span> (meaning “those which signifies with”) to each of the houses based on numerological principles, but he gives little explanation as to their use. Aries, as the first sign of the year, beginning at the vernal equinox, becomes the consignificator of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house; Taurus is the consignificator of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house; and so on around the wheel until we reach Pisces, which is the consignificator of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house.</p>
<p class="tx">In a similar fashion, Saturn, as the first visible planet in the Chaldean order, becomes the consignificator of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house; Jupiter, of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house; Mars, of the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house; Sun, of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house; Venus, of the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house; Mercury, of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house; Moon, of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house; and so on, repeating the Chaldean sequence, until we reach the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, whose consignificator is Venus.</p>
<p class="tx">Fortunately, Ebenezer Sibly (1751–c. 1799) explains how <span class="ital">consignificators</span> were interpreted in the eighteenth century:</p>
<p class="Q4">Now, as every one of the twelve houses of heaven have their significators, so have they also their <span class="ital">consignificators</span>, which have frequent operation, and therefore ought <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>o be considered. A consignificator is a planet either fallen into conjunction, or joined in aspect, with the principal significator; in which cases, the planet eithe<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> assists or opposes in the matter under consideration; if it be joined with a benevolent planet, it imports good; but, if it happens to the contrary, it either denotes destruction to the subject of the enquiry, or great disturbance in effecting it. (Sibly 1826, 157)</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page113" title="113"></span>Sibly gives the example of Saturn, as consignificator of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house, when dignified and favorably aspected in a natal chart, promising a good physical constitution and a long life.</p>
<p class="tx">There is also a word of caution in the traditional literature about consignificators. Deborah Houlding, for example, in the introduction to her book on the astrological houses, cites a warning by Nicholas Culpeper (1658) about the adoption of what is now called the “12-letter alphabet” of astrology:</p>
<p class="Q4">Some authors hold an opinion that the signs carry the same signification in order that the houses of heaven do, and Aries should signify life, Taurus estate, Gemini brethren and short journeys, you know the rest. Truly, my own opinion is that many authors invented whimsies, and when they had done, set them down to posterity for Truth; who taking them up without trial, clothed tradition in plush and left poor reason to go in rags. An author said so; ergo ’tis true, right or wrong. (Culpeper 1658, cited by Houlding 2006, xiv)</p>
<p class="tx">Unfortunately, many modern astrologers have ignored Culpeper’s wisdom and now erroneously equate houses, signs, and planets.</p>
