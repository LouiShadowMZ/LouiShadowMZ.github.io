<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-11">BONATTI ON PERFECTION AND THE <br/>IMPORTANCE OF RECEPTION (1277)</p>
<p class="txni">This section summarizes the principles laid down by Guido Bonatti in his <span class="ital">Liber Astronomiae (Book of Astronomy) </span>on how matters can be perfected in a horary chart (Dykes translation, 2010). Citing Masha’allah and other ancient texts, Bonatti describes three principal conditions under which matters can be perfected:</p>
<p class="list1">1. When the ruler of the querent (1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house ruler) and the ruler of the house of the quesited <span class="ital">conjoin or complete a major aspect</span> (sextile, square, trine, opposition); this also applies to the Moon, a significatrix in every horary question.</p>
<p class="list2">2. If the previous condition (#1) is not met, then perfection can occur via a <span class="ital">translation or transfer of light </span>in which another planet separates from one significator and the<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> joins to the other by conjunction or aspect.</p>
<p class="list3">3. Or, if the condition in #1 is not met, then perfection can occur when both significators apply to a heavier (slower) planet, which <span class="ital">collects their light</span> and itself perfects the matter. This method is called <span class="ital">collection of light</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Bonatti further explains how the nature of the aspect and the type of reception between the significators will affect the manner of perfection. Reception exists when two planets are applying to aspect each other and one of the significators (the guest planet) lies in a dignity of the other (the host planet), so that the host receives its visiting guest in one of its dignities. Dignity can occur by domicile, exaltation, triplicity, term (bound), or face. Bonatti appears to be drawing on the work of Abu Ma’shar (787–886 CE), who wrote:</p>
<p class="Q1">[52] “Reception” is when a planet (A) applies to a planet (B) from the house of the planet (B) to which it applies or from its (B’s) exaltation, term, triplicity or decan: then it (B) receives it (A). Or the receiver of the application (B) is in the house of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page68" title="68"></span>pushing planet (A) or in its other shares which we have mentioned before, then it (A) receives it (B).</p>
<p class="Q3">[53] The strongest of these is the Lord of the house or of the exaltation. The Lord of the term or triplicity or decan are weak unless two or more of them ar<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> joined. <span class="roman">(Abu Ma’shar 1994)</span></p>
<p class="tx">In other words, the most potent form of reception occurs when two planets are involved in an applying aspect <span class="ital">and</span> one of them is in a zodiacal region where the other planet has dignity (ownership) by sign (domicile) or exaltation. Reception can also occu<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> via two or more of the lesser dignities, namely, triplicity, term, and face (decan). Note that Abu Ma’shar <span class="ital">requires an applying aspect</span>. When no such aspect exists, the planet that occupies a dignity of the other is said to be in the other’s “generosity,” because if you are a guest on my property, I (as “lord”) will act munificently toward you. As astrologer Ryhan Butler explains:</p>
<p class="Q4">Essentially, reception is what happens when a planet aspects another planet who is one of its lords. (Butler 2018)</p>
<p class="tx">Generally, matters perfect most easily, without difficulty or impediment, if the significators conjoin or unite via a trine or sextile aspect and, at the same time, <span class="ital">with reception</span>. In <span class="CharOverride-4">c</span>ontrast, matters perfect only with struggle, persistence, and great effort if the significators connect by an aspect of square or opposition, and with even more impediment when <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>here is no reception. Table 8 contains a list of aspects between significators, with and without reception, in order of the easiest, most effortless, and most pleasant at the top an<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> the most difficult, frustrating, and laborious at the bottom, much like the pain scales use<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> by modern medical professionals. Interpretations in the right-hand column are mine, not Bonatti’s.</p>

<p class="tx">In the second column, which shows increasing “pain” as you go down the column, one can read “hurt” as indicating that matters will require much diligence and persistence and will perfect only under increasingly “malefic” influences, such as mounting difficulty, stress, effort, striving, toil, anguish, anxiety, desperation, hardship, expense, unhappiness<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> and so on. For example, in the chart of Palchus on the safety of a ship at sea (chart 9)<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> the debilitated Scorpio Moon’s next aspect is a sextile to Saturn in Virgo <span class="ital">without reception</span>. According to Bonatti, a sextile without reception is similar to a square with reception and indicates a moderate amount of difficulty, stress, anguish, and hardship.</p>

<p class="tx">In Lilly’s table, the orbs listed refer to the radius of a sphere of light surrounding each planet. Thus, Saturn (with an orb of 10 degrees) is surrounded by a sphere of light that is 20 degrees in <span class="ital">diameter</span>, 10 degrees in <span class="ital">radius</span>, and 5 degrees in <span class="ital">moiety</span>. In addition, rays of light of the same spherical dimensions are projected around the zodiac in the distribution pattern of the major Ptolemaic aspects (sextile, square, trine, and opposition). </p>
<p class="Ahead">Johannes Schöner’s Planetary Orbs</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly worked with the moieties of the planets, which are measured as half the radius of their orbs (or a quarter of the diameter of their orbs). The idea is that if two planets’ rays <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ouch within their respective moieties, the planets are meeting each other at least halfway and are able to effect the outcome of the aspect between them. Lilly gives the following example based on Venus having an orb of 8 degrees (moiety of 4 degrees) and Saturn an orb of 10 degrees (moiety of 5 degrees):</p>
<p class="Q4">If Venus be in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> degree of Taurus, and Saturn in the 18<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> degree of Virgo, here … Venus is in a Platick trine to Saturn, because she is within the <span class="ital">moiety</span> of both their Orbs; for the moiety of Saturn his Rays or Orbs is 5<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span>, and of Venus 4<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span>; and the distance betwixt them and their perfect [trine] aspect is 8 degrees. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 107)</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page71" title="71"></span>According to Johannes Schöner, in his <span class="ital">Opera Mathematica</span> (Nuremberg, 1551), the Sun (with an orb of 15 degrees) has a moiety of 7.5 degrees, and Saturn (with an orb of 9 degrees) has a moiety of 4.5 degrees. The sum of these moieties (7.5 + 4.5) is 12. According to Lilly, the Sun and Saturn form a <span class="ital">platick</span> aspect when they are no more than 12 degrees apart (the sum of the moieties of the two planets). </p>
<p class="tx">If the Sun and Saturn were in the same degree (1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> through 30<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) of their respective signs, Lilly would call the aspect <span class="ital">partill.</span> Thus, if the Sun and Saturn were both in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> degree of signs that are 120 degrees apart, they would be considered in <span class="ital">partill</span> (modern spelling <span class="ital">partile</span>) trine. </p>

<p class="Ahead-nsa"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page72" title="72"></span>Lilly’s 5-Degree Rule</p>
<p class="txni">In <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span> (1647), William Lilly describes the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house as beginning at the eastern horizon (Ascendant degree) and extending to the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp, and he defines the cusps as the borders of the houses. Lilly defines the <span class="ital">cusp</span> as “the very entrance of any house, or first beginning” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 33) of the house and also states: </p>
<p class="Q4">What Planet you shall find to be in that space [between the cusps, or entrances, of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> and 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> houses], you shall say that he is in the first house; yet if he be within 5 degrees of the Cusp of any house, his virtue shall be assigned to the house whose Cusp he is nearest. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 33)</p>
<p class="tx">Notice that Lilly does not say that the planet within 5 degrees of the cusp of the next house occupies the next house, but rather that <span class="ital">the virtue or influence of that planet</span> will be felt in the next house because of the planet’s proximity to its cusp.</p>
<p class="tx">In other words, a planet in any house that is approaching within 5 degrees of the cusp of the next house <span class="ital">influences the subsequent house</span> with its virtue, but the body of the planet <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>bviously lies in the house where it is located in the chart. Many horary astrologers interpret Lilly’s dictum to mean that, for example, a planet in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house but within 5 degrees of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp can be read <span class="ital">as if</span> it were a 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house planet, even though the body of the planet in reality occupies the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house. This idea is consistent with Morin’s precept <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hat the initial degree (cusp) of a Regiomontanus house is the most powerful point of tha<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> house: <span class="ital">“domus principium esse punctum ipsius domus robustissimum”</span> (<span class="ital">Astrologia Gallica, Book 17</span>, chap. 2).</p>
<p class="tx">The basis for this belief about switching houses probably derives from Ptolemy’s discussion of “prorogatory places” in his chapter on determining the length of life. In the <span class="ital">Tetrabiblos</span>, Ptolemy states that the first “prorogatory <span class="ital">place</span>” is “the sign on the angle of the ascendant, from the fifth degree above the horizon to the twenty-fifth degree below it” (Ashmand translation, chap. XII). Ptolemy seems to be implying that the influence of the Ascendant, which Lilly regarded as the cusp of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house, begins 5 degrees prior to <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he degree of the Ascendant, and so on around the wheel for the other “places,” which are measured in equal 30-degree segments. Lilly concluded that the influence of any hous<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> extends to 5 degrees before its cusp; or, to put it another way, Lilly states: “If he [a planet] be within 5 degrees of the Cusp of any house, <span class="bold">his virtue</span> shall be assigned to the house whose Cusp he is nearest” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 33).</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page73" title="73"></span>Frawley on the 5-Degree Rule</p>
<p class="txni">Astrologer John Frawley has an interesting take on planetary aspects to house cusps and the 5-degree rule. Frawley distinguishes between <span class="ital">fulfillment</span>, that is, the signifier of the matter inquired about (the quesited) applying to the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house cusp (signifying the qu<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span>rent), and <span class="ital">desire</span>, that is, the planetary ruler of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house (querent’s signifier) applying to the cusp of the quesited:</p>
<p class="Q4">Planet to cusp aspects, however, are not to be relied upon to show an event unless the planet signifying the quesited is applying to the querent’s cusp. The querent’<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> planet applying to the cusp of the quesited, whatever Lilly may say to the contrary, tends to show desire rather than fulfilment and is not reliable—except when the event is more or less certain. That is, “Will I get the job?” with Lord of the first applying to the MC: desire; “When will I get the job?” with Lord of MC applying to the 1st: certainty. (Frawley 2002)</p>
<p class="tx">Regarding the 5-degree rule, Frawley interprets Lilly’s statement to mean that a planet within the 5 degrees immediately before a cusp can be regarded as if it occupied the nex<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> house. He notes, however, that “to be counted as being in the next house, the planet <span class="ital">mus</span><span class="ital CharOverride-4">t</span> be in the same sign as the cusp, no matter how close it is to that cusp” (Frawley 2005, 17). Frawley also draws a sharp distinction between a planet being one or two degrees immediately before a cusp (and thus technically within the previous house) and being one or two degrees immediately following the cusp (which places it unequivocally inside the house initiated by that cusp). Specifically, he states that “the planet ‘on the cusp’ (immediately before the cusp) has power over that house, like the enemy battering on your castle gate; the planet ‘inside the cusp’ is in the power of that house, like the enemy trapped within” (Frawley 2014, 193).</p>
<p class="Ahead">Combining Whole Sign Places with Regiomontanus Houses</p>
<p class="txni">There is yet another way that planets in one house can be read as if they were occupying an adjacent house. Morin de Villefranche, in discussing the chart of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (b. 19 December 1594 Gregorian, 7:30 a.m. LMT, Stockholm, 59N20, 18E03), notes that in his natal chart the king has a debilitated Saturn in Leo in his Regiomontanu<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, making Saturn a signifier of the nature of the king’s death. Because <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page74" title="74"></span>Saturn lies in Leo, which is the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Whole Sign place from the Ascendant, Morin predicts that the king will die in a foreign land. According to Morin, </p>
<p class="Q4">Saturn is formally in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> and accidentally in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>—<span class="ital">Saturnus est formaliter in octava &amp; accidentaliter in novena.</span> (<span class="ital">Astrologia Gallica</span> 1661, 434)</p>
<p class="tx">In fact, with his natal Mars in the 12th house square natal Saturn in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in Leo, which is the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Whole Sign place, the king was shot to death in 1632 during a battle in Germany, a foreign land. Morin regarded Regiomontanus houses as the rational system of domification, and the Whole Sign places as “accidental houses.”</p>
