<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-6">MY STORY</p>
<p class="txni">Astrology has been part of my life for the past sixty years. I don’t recall exactly how the interest began, but by age ten I was surrounded by references to astrology in movies, on TV, and in magazines and newspapers, with their daily Sun sign horoscope columns. Eve<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> the nuns at Catholic school talked about the Three Wise Men, the Magi astrologers from <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he East who followed the star of Bethlehem, which announced the birth of Jesus. </p>
<p class="tx">Not only the secular media but also the religious establishment of my youth fostered the idea that the celestial bodies conveyed messages, perhaps of divine origin, that coul<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> be read and understood by those who were wise enough to learn the secrets of the stars. How did the Magi know that the Star of Bethlehem indicated the birth of a messiah? Why would such wise men risk a dangerous journey simply because they saw something in the heavens? How did the Magi discern the precise location of the baby Jesus? The nuns had piqued my curiosity, and I wanted to learn more.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">When I was about eleven years old, an event occurred that I have written about previously. My father purchased a little scroll about his Gemini Sun sign in a machine at an amusement park. On the ride home, I read the scroll and was astounded by its accuracy in describing my father—his personality, hobbies, interests, the type of work he did, his favorite color, his foibles, etc. At first I thought he had secretly planted the scroll as a practical joke. How could a machine know this much about my father without ever having met him? I went to the library, checked out one of the few books about astrology, and discovered that the scroll was merely parroting the standard lore about Gemini, so it was not a practical joke. Maybe there really was something to astrology! After the experience at the amusement park, I began to read all I could find about the celestial art. When I learned the basics, I started to cast charts (by hand in those days) and give readings to family an</span><span class="CharOverride-2">d</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> friends.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page12" title="12"></span><span class="CharOverride-1">One of my frustrations was that I did not know the exact time of my birth. It was not on my birth certificate and my father could not recall it precisely, except to say that it was mid-</span><span class="CharOverride-2">m</span><span class="CharOverride-1">orning when I emerged from the womb. My mother died when I was eight years old, so I couldn’t ask her. At some point in my teens, I read an astrology book that mentioned </span><span class="CharOverride-1">“rectifying” a chart based on major events in a person’s life. The major event in my life </span><span class="CharOverride-1">up until </span><span class="CharOverride-2">t</span><span class="CharOverride-1">hat time had been the death of my mother. Using the date of her demise and the instruc</span><span class="CharOverride-2">t</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ions in the astrology book, I deduced that I must have been born at 9:04 a.m., a time consistent with my father’s memory. Years later, while helping my parents clean out their attic, I came across a small notebook in which my father had written next to my date of birth “Anthony, 9:05,”which I understood to mean that I was born at 9:05 a.m. Eastern War Time (EWT). I still have the notebook, and I continue to be amazed that the rules of astrology led me to a time just one minute different from the one recorded by my father. The copy of my birth certificate that I’d had since my teens did not show the birth time. Recently it occurred to me to obtain a new copy, which did give a birth time of 9:09 a.m. EWT, just four minutes later than the time my father had recorded.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">One of my sources of information was the magazine </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">Dell Horoscope</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, which I read regularly during my teenage years. One day I saw an ad from an astrology teacher in Brooklyn, asking readers to submit questions to be used by a class on horary astrology. It seemed unbelievable that an astrologer could answer a question by erecting a chart for the moment of an inquiry. Nonetheless, my curiosity got the better of me and I submitted a question, whose content I no longer remember clearly. I was a high school student at the time, and most likely my question had to do with whether I would receive a scholarship I had applied for. A couple months later, I received a reply in the mail stating simply that the answer to my question was no. The response happened to be accurate, but the skeptic in me cautioned that there was a fifty-fifty chance of getting a yes-no question right, so it was probably just a coincidence.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">During the 1960s, I loved reading about modern science. One book that made a lasting impression on me was </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">Science Is a Sacred Cow</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> by chemist Anthony Standen, in which he argued that the general public held the modern scientific worldview too much in awe. Another volume that strongly influenced my thinking was </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">Science and Common Sense</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> by James B. Conant, in which he held that laypersons had very little idea about what science could or could not do. I read a series of books on this topic and recall the following anecdote, most likely apocryphal, in one of them.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">The story goes that some graduate students in astronomy were spending time at a remote observatory in the English countryside. One evening a woman from the village approached and asked them to cast a chart to locate her missing wedding ring. The students</span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page13" title="13"></span><span class="CharOverride-1"> explained that they were astronomers, not astrologers, and that she was mistaken in thinking that they could be of help. Nonetheless, there happened to be a copy of William Lilly’s astrology text on the bookshelf, so the students decided to amuse themselves by casting a horoscope for the woman’s question. Following the guidelines given by Lilly, the</span><span class="CharOverride-2">y</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> instructed the woman where to look. Off she went, only to return the next day, thanking them profusely because their directions had led her straight to the lost ring. The students were amused and attributed their success to mere coincidence because, </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">being scientists</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, the</span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">y knew</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> that there was no validity to astrology.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">After the </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">Dell Horoscope</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> experience with my own horary question, my interest in horary waned until 1972, when, in my late twenties, I came across a book called </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">An Introduction to Astrology (A Newcastle Occult Book),</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> which was an 1852 abbreviated version of William Lilly’s 1647 text </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">Christian Astrology.</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> Upon seeing this volume, my thoughts returned to the story of the British astronomy students who helped the woman find her lost ring. I bought the book and tried to read and follow its instructions, but the Old English, with its arcane terminology, was difficult to follow. I was also quite busy doing other things and did not have time to devote to deciphering this arcane branch of the art. Over the next several years, I periodically returned to the book and tried to interpret horary charts but without much success.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">Then, in the 1980s, I began to attempt more horary charts. Living in Connecticut, I had access to lectures and workshops on various topics in astrology, including horary. At various times, Gilbert Navarro and Alphee Lavoie gave talks and workshops about the horary practices that were based in the modern methods of </span>twentieth-century astrologer<span class="CharOverride-1"> Ivy M. Goldstein-Jacobson. In the late 1980s, I attended a lecture on horary by Joan McEvers, after which Joan and I carried on an email correspondence. Around this time, I also became involved with JustUs &amp; Associates, publisher of </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">The Horary Practitioner</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, a journal that took a traditional approach to horary.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">A turning point in my practice of horary came in 1989, when my friend Sara was visiting. She was pregnant and worried about the health of the fetus. Sara asked me to cast a chart to see if her unborn baby was okay. I explained that I was only a beginner and could not guarantee a good reading. She insisted, and I reluctantly agreed. I pulled out my Newcastle abbreviated version of Lilly’s text and followed Lilly’s “rules.” All the indications in the chart suggested that the pregnancy was not viable and would end up in miscarriage, and I wished I had never agreed to look at the chart. Rather than tell Sara directly what I was seeing, I said that I was having trouble finding positive indicators and tried to reassure her that I was a mere novice and she should ignore my inability to see a healthy fetus in th</span><span class="CharOverride-2">e</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> chart. When she saw her doctor a few days later, however, she learned that she had miscarried. I was totally freaked out and did not do any horary charts for some time thereafter.</span></p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page14" title="14"></span>A Chart for News of an Illness</p>
<p class="txni"><span class="CharOverride-1">I had a similar experience a year or so later. A colleague of mine sent an email to notify her friends and associates that she had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I cast a chart for the moment at which I read her news of her illness. A decumbiture chart (from the Latin </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">decumbere</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, “to lie down” on one’s sickbed) is similar to a horary chart, but it is cast for the moment a person falls ill, presents for diagnosis, or makes first contact with a physician about the illness (</span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">CA</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> 243). Astrologer Tanya Daniels (2017) notes that traditionally a decumbiture chart can be cast for the moment when</span></p>
<p class="list1">• the patient falls ill enough to take to bed;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> the patient consults a physician; or</p>
<p class="list3"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> a urine sample is given to the physician to aid in diagnosis. </p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">In this type of chart, the Ascendant represents the sick person; the 6</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> house, the illness; and the 7</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, the physician; and the 8</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> signifies death. This chart is cast with Regiomontanus houses for Wednesday, 24 January 1990, at 1:44 p.m. EST, 41N17, 73W02 (chart 2). It is a Mercury day during a Moon hour. Mercury rules the Ascendant and closely conjoins the Moon, suggesting that the chart is radical (valid). Technically speaking, this is an event chart for the moment I received the news about her illness, but I decided to interpret it as if it were a decumbiture chart. Had I been her physician, a map of the heavens cast for the moment she consulted me about her ailment would be considered a true decumbiture chart.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">Gemini rises in the chart, making Mercury the significator of the sick person whose chart is under consideration. The Moon is her co-ruler. Both Mercury and the Moon are separa</span><span class="CharOverride-2">ti</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ng from Uranus, which makes symbolic sense since she had recently received an unexpected and surprising diagnosis from her physician, who is represented by the 7</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> house.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">Jupiter retrograde in Cancer in the 1</span><span class="CharOverride-11">st</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> house (the body) describes the cancer growing in her breast. Jupiter is a symbol of growth and increase. The sign Cancer is related to the mammary tissue of the human breast.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">The ruler of the Scorpio 6</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> house cusp of illness is Mars, which closely opposes the Ascendant (the body), suggesting an aggressive attack on her physical well-being. Most of the sign Sagittarius lies in the 6</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> house, giving Jupiter co-rulership over her illness. In addi</span><span class="CharOverride-2">t</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ion, Jupiter disposes the 6</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> cusp ruler Mars, which lies in Jupiter’s sign, Sagittarius.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-1">Ascendant-ruler Mercury lies in Capricorn in the 7</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, where it applies to oppose Chiron (wounds that will not heal) in the 1</span><span class="CharOverride-11">st</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> (her body) and to conjoin Neptune (a general signifier of chronic illness). Mercury then advances to conjoin Saturn (ruler of the 8</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1">) at the cusp </span><span class="CharOverride-2">o</span><span class="CharOverride-1">f the 8</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> house of death. Mercury also co-rules the 4</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> house of final endings, because Virgo is intercepted in the Regiomontanus 4</span><span class="CharOverride-11">th</span><span class="CharOverride-1">.</span></p>

<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page16" title="16"></span><span class="CharOverride-1">Her co-ruler, the Moon, applies to conjoin Mercury and moves on to oppose Chiron and then conjoins Neptune and finally Saturn, ruler of the 8th, at the cusp of the 8th house of death. The following aphorisms from British astrologer Richard Saunders’s </span><span class="ital CharOverride-1">Apollo Anglicanus </span><span class="CharOverride-1">(1681) are relevant in this chart: </span></p>
<p class="list1">• The Moon applying to any Planet in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House is ever more deadly.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> The Lord of the Ascendant applying to the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or to Stars posited therein, and to the Moon any manner of way corrupted, denotes Death.</p>
<p class="list3-right-indent">• The Moon carrying the Light of the Lord of the Ascendant to the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> denotes death.</p>
<p class="tx">In addition, Saturn rules the Aquarius 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp, which signifies the medicine or curative measures in a decumbiture chart. Saturn is quite strong in its domicile Capricorn, but it lies exactly on the unfortunate 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp of death.</p>
<p class="tx">Pluto at the cusp of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> suggests a serious illness full of complications that will transform her life. Pluto is associated with chemistry and radiation; its location at the cusp of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> could be a reference to the chemotherapy and radiation she would receive. Pluto, lord of the underworld, is also “at the bendings” (square the Moon’s nodes), which often indicates reading some type of crisis or point of inflection in a situation.</p>
<p class="tx">Venus rules her 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of confinement and undoing, and is debilitated being under the sunbeams. Venus is also retrograde in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death and mutually applying to a conjunction with Saturn, ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>. The Venus-Saturn conjunction never perfects, because Venus retrogrades only to 20° 55' Capricorn and then turns direct with Saturn at 20° 05' Capricorn, so the two planets are 50 arc minutes apart in the same degree of Capricorn when Venus turns direct.</p>
<p class="tx">The Arabic parts for this chart confirm the basic story. The Part of Death (Ascendant + 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp − Moon) conjoins Jupiter in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>; the Part of Danger or Peril (Ascendant + 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp − Saturn) conjoins the Ascendant; and the Part of Spirit (Ascendant + Sun − Moon) opposes Saturn, ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death. Confirmatory evidence helps to strengthen the basic interpretation of the chart.</p>
<p class="tx">I found this chart quite upsetting and kept it to myself until now, some thirty years later. Unfortunately, as the chart intimated, my colleague had an aggressive form of breast cancer that rather quickly led to her demise. </p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page17" title="17"></span>Molly’s Missing Voice Recorder</p>
<p class="txni">On a lighter note, as I was researching material for this text, I came across a successful horary regarding a lost object. Astrologer Molly C. Gauthier, author of the blog <span class="ital">Molly’s Astrology,</span> gave permission to cite a horary chart she did about a missing voice recorder, a small, silvery electronic gadget with a light green screen. On 26 October 2006, she sat down to record a reading for a client, but her recorder was nowhere to be found. As Molly put it, “I looked everywhere. I retraced my steps. I looked in the drawers. I looked in between the books. I looked under the desk. I looked in the drawers again. I looked in the trash. No recorder.” </p>
<p class="tx">Having exhausted all the usual means of locating the device, she decided to cast a horary chart for 26 October 2006, 10:44:49 a.m. EDT, 38N02, 78W29, Placidus houses. It is a Jupiter day during a Venus hour. Chart 3 has Regiomontanus houses, but the planets are in the same houses as in the Placidus chart.</p>
<p class="tx">Molly, the querent, is signified by Jupiter, which rules the Sagittarius Ascendant. Her co-ruler is the Moon in Sagittarius in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house. Jupiter is just separating from a square to Saturn, which Lilly interprets as a sign of forgetfulness on the part of the querent. Th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> planet Mercury (items used for communication) is recently separating from Ascendant-ruler Jupiter (the querent), suggesting that the chart is radical (valid) and fit to be judged.</p>
<p class="tx">In other words, Molly put the device somewhere and forgot where she put it. Jupiter in the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> may be another indication of her forgetfulness or “self-undoing” in misplacing the electronic gadget. The 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, being the “joy” of Saturn (the “author of mischief”), suggests that Saturn may be happy to help Jupiter (the querent) find the missing article.</p>
<p class="tx">The missing item is shown by the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of movable goods. Capricorn on the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> indicates that Saturn rules the misplaced voice recorder. The Part of Fortune in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> is an indication that she will get it back. The traditional ruler of the Part of Fortune is Saturn, which is also the primary significator of the missing goods. The Moon (her co-ruler) applies shortly to trine Saturn (the missing item), suggesting that she will soon be <span class="CharOverride-4">r</span>eunited with her voice recorder. But where is it?</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Chart 3: Molly’s Missing Voice Recorder<br/>10:44:49 a.m. EDT, 26 October 2006, 38N02, 78W29. Jupiter day, Venus hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 8° 12' Aries.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page19" title="19"></span>Saturn lies at the cusp of the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, a cadent house, which indicates a location that is concealed, hidden, or behind something (like a screen) and not easy to find, but she already knew it was hard to find when her search turned up nothing. To my delight, Molly says that she consulted my 1996 book on horary, where she read the following: “If near a house cusp, then near a door, window, or passage between rooms.” She adds: </p>
<p class="Q4">I check the bag hanging from my doorknob. No luck. I check the chest of drawers next to the door. Nope. I open the window shade. TA-DA! There it is, sitting on the windowsill, absolutely concealed by the shades. A happy ending!</p>
<p class="tx">Such is the power of horary astrology. Although Molly doesn’t mention it, Leo on the cusp of the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> could indicate a sunny or warm location, and Saturn is a natural signifier of shade and darkness. </p>
<p class="tx">Many horary astrologers look to the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house for information about the location of misplaced items, hidden treasure, or missing people. On the page “House Rulerships in Practice: The Fourth House” on her <span class="ital">Skyscript </span>website, Deborah Houlding notes that “i<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> questions concerning missing persons or lost items, the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> describes the nature of the surface beneath them and in murder cases can help to describe the location of the body.” Seeing a Water sign on the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp, with the ruler of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in another Water sign, Houlding might say that the object would be found near water.</p>
<p class="tx">Olivia Barclay contends that the <span class="ital">planet ruling the 4</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">th</span><span class="ital"> cusp</span> tells you where to look, and the <span class="ital">sign that the ruler of the 4</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">th</span><span class="ital"> occupies </span>gives further information (Barclay 1990, 184). In Molly’s chart, <span class="ital">Jupiter</span> ruling the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> would suggest a location near wood, according to Barclay, and I assume the windowsill was made of wood. Since Jupiter lies in the Water sign Scorpio, Barclay would say that the voice recorder might be found near a sink, in a kitchen, or near water or dampness—which, as far as I know, was not the case in this example. </p>
<p class="tx">In any case, the planet ruling the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp and the sign occupied by that planet may give hints about the nature of the place where the mislaid item is located. In my own experience, I have not found the significations of the <span class="ital">planet</span> ruling the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp to be as helpful as Barclay implies. John Frawley reports an experience similar to mine with Barclay’s comments about the planetary ruler of the 4th, and he states: “Connections wit<span class="CharOverride-4">h</span> Mercury show that it [the missing item] is with books or knick-knacks; connections wit<span class="CharOverride-4">h</span> Venus, near clothes (especially women’s), bedding or soft furnishings. I haven’t noticed similar major indications with the other planets” (Frawley 2014, 175).</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page20" title="20"></span>Ivy Goldstein-Jacobson makes the following distinction about an item that is lost, mislaid, or stolen: “The possession itself is ruled by its owner’s Second House, but <span class="ital">the possibility of losing or mislaying it is ruled by the Fourth House”</span> [italics mine], adding that the item has been mislaid “if the ruler of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> also rules the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>, or is in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>, or conjunct it<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> ruler” (Goldstein-Jacobson 1960, 153). In Molly’s chart, Goldstein-Jacobson is right on target. Jupiter rules the Sagittarius Ascendant as well as the Pisces 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp. In addition, the Moon, which rules the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, occupies the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house of the chart.</p>
<p class="tx">These comments by Barclay and Goldstein-Jacobson appear to derive from a passage in Lilly’s <span class="ital">Christian Astrology </span>: </p>
<p class="Q4">The second house and the Lord of the second house and the Moon shall signify the Goods or thing that is lost, stolen or mist [missing]; the fourth house and his Lord shall signify the place where it is laid, put or done, or conveyed unto, and is in at that instant of time. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 332)</p>
<p class="tx">Because the above quotation from <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span> is the key to Lilly’s approach, I will summarize it here:</p>
<p class="list1">• What is missing? The 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, the planetary ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, and the Moon signify the goods of the querent and the thing that is lost, stolen, or missing.</p>
<p class="list3">• Where is it? The 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, the planetary ruler of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, and the sign and house occupied by the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ruler describe the location of the missing item (where it has been laid, put, or conveyed and where it currently resides at the time of the question).</p>
<p class="tx">Although some horary astrologers reserve the Moon for missing animals or people, in this passage Lilly uses <span class="ital">the Moon as a general significator of fugitives and all lost or missing things</span> (<span class="ital">CA</span> 323). In Molly’s chart, the Moon in Sagittarius (a Fire sign) in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house suggest<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> that the missing item may be in a place frequented by the querent, a place that is bright, sunny, and warm. The Moon’s placement next to Pluto is descriptive of the item’s concealment by a shade, because Pluto is the Lord of Hades, the realm of the shades, or disembodied spirits.</p>
