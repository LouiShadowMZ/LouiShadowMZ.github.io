<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-41">A MISSING YOUNG WOMAN AND <br/>THE VALENTINE’S DAY CONFESSION</p>
<p class="txni">Sometimes we receive news that something or someone is missing, and we want to know what happened and whether recovery is possible. Lilly found himself in such a situation in 1637 when he ordered some fish to eat for Lent and “one of the Watermen, instead of bringing my Fish home, acquainted me, their warehouse was robbed last night, an<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> my Fish stolen: I took the exact time when I first heard the report, and erected the Figure accordingly, endeavouring to give myself satisfaction what became of my goods, and, of possible, to recover part of all of them again”<span class="ital"> </span>(<span class="ital">CA</span> 397, chap. LIV).</p>
<p class="tx">Note that Lilly erected a chart for the missing item at the exact time when he first heard the report, even though the report turned out to be false. In fact, the fish had been stolen and the waterman was either lying or unknowingly giving false information.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly also says that “if a question be demanded of one absent in a general way, and the querent has no relation to the party; then the first House, the Lord of the House and th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Moon shall signify the absent party; and the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House or planet posited either in the House or within five degrees of the Cusp of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House shall show his death or its quality”(<span class="ital">CA</span> 151).</p>
<p class="tx">A teenage Spanish girl disappeared in Seville on 24 January 2009. The case made headlines throughout Spain and was resolved when her ex-boyfriend was arrested by the Spanish National Police for contradictions in his statements. He finally confessed to the crime on February 14, admitting that during a heated argument he had hit the young woman forcefully on the head with a blunt ashtray. Apparently his brother helped him clean up the bloody scene, and his friend allegedly helped him dump the body and the ashtray in <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he Guadalquivir River during the wee hours of the morning. As far as I know, neither the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page282" title="282"></span>young woman’s body nor the ashtray has ever been found. The police investigation estimated the time of death to be 8:50 p.m.</p>
<p class="tx">Before the boyfriend confessed on February 14 (Día de San Valentín), there were several reports in the news about when and where she was last seen. She left her home on Saturday afternoon, telling her mother that she was going to resolve an issue with her ex-boyfriend, who had begun seeing another girl. A friend claimed to have seen the former couple on the street at 8:15 p.m., and a neighbor said she saw the young woman in the lobby of the apartment building at 9:30 p.m. At 10:15 p.m., the young woman’s mother called her daughter’s mobile phone, but it was switched off.</p>
<p class="tx">The last reported sighting of the young woman was at 9:30 p.m., but the police investigation estimated the time of death to be 8:50 p.m., raising some doubt as to the validity of either the time of the sighting or the time of death. Nonetheless, Lilly would use the exact time of the report. Here is the event chart, with only the seven visible planets, for the time and place of <span class="ital">the report of the last time she was seen</span>: 9:30 p.m. CET, Saturday, 24 January 2009, Seville, Spain (chart 40).</p>
<p class="tx">It is a Saturn day during a Saturn hour, which seems appropriate for such a somber and tragic event. Retrograde Saturn in Virgo occupies the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house, and Saturn is in mutual reception with Mercury in Capricorn in the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of pleasure, delight, and merriment. Venus, the personification of sexual pleasure, is said to “rejoice” in the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which modern astrologers associate with romance and love affairs.</p>
<p class="tx">Virgo rises, making Mercury the significator of the missing girl. The Moon is her co-ruler. The fact that the Moon lies in the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house suggests that issues related to romance are on her mind.</p>
<p class="tx">Aries on the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp makes Mars the ruler of her death. Mercury (the missing girl) is retrograde in Capricorn in the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and applies to Mars (8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ruler) at the same time that Mars moves toward Mercury. The Mercury-Mars conjunction perfects on January 27, and Mercury turns direct on February 1. The Ascendant ruler mutually applying to conjoin the ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house suggests that she is approaching death. In addition, her co-ruler Moon applies to conjoin Mars (death). In other words, both the ruler and the co-ruler of the missing girl are applying to conjoin the ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (he<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> death) in this chart.</p>
<p class="tx">Her ex-boyfriend is shown by the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, with Pisces on the cusp, making Jupiter the signifier of the ex-boyfriend. Jupiter is in bad shape, being peregrine and combust the Sun, ruler of the young woman’s 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of secret enemies and undoing. </p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"></a>Chart 40: Young Spanish Woman Last Seen (Event Chart) <br/>24 January 2009, 9:30 p.m. CET, Seville, Spain. Saturn day, Saturn hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 2<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 48' Capricorn.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page284" title="284"></span>Venus (exalted in Pisces) rules the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp by exaltation. Thus, Venus is a potential co-ruler of the ex-boyfriend. In addition, Venus rules the radical 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which is the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of siblings of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ex-boyfriend, whose brother played a role covering up the crime. Venus is separating (by 30 minutes of arc) from an opposition with retrograde Saturn, involving the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> and 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> houses. This opposition reflects the recent argument between the former couple about matters of romance (Saturn rules the 5th house).</p>
<p class="tx">Only one significant fixed star makes a contact in this chart: Saturn conjoins the fixed star <span class="ital">Denebola</span>, which lies in the tail of the constellation Leo. Apparently the young woman’s decision to confront her ex-boyfriend about his new 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house source of pleasure and merriment was like pulling the tail of a lion. Ptolemy associates Denebola with Saturn an<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> Venus, and Robson says it is related to “despair, regrets, public disgrace, misfortune from the elements of nature, and happiness turned to anger” (Robson 1923, 160–161). </p>
<p class="tx">The ex-boyfriend confessed to the murder on Valentine’s Day, 14 February 2009.</p>
