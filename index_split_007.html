	<h2 id="id_Toc184334417" class="block_12">HOW LONG WILL ONE LIVE?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Ask for a number between 1 and 249: for that number fix the ascendant referring to the Table for
		Krishnamurti Padhdhati.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If the ascendant is in a movable sign, the 11th house is the badhakasthana, if the ascendant
		falls in a fixed sign, 9th house is the badhakasthann, if the ascendant falls in a common sign, the 7th house is
		the badhakasthana.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whatever be the sign in which the ascendant falls, the 2nd and the 7th houses are marakasthanas.
		Therefore one is to judge all these three houses and find out the significators.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">One has to erect the map and note down the dasa balance to find out the date of death.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to western system, the ascendant, the Moon and the Sun should not be forming evil
		aspects with the lord of 4, 6, 8 and 12, and at the same time the lord of the ascendant the Moon and the Sun
		must be strong. In that case, long life is promised. Jupiter and Venus ruling good houses and the lord of the
		ascendant forming good aspect with Moon or Sun promises long life. But if the ascendant, Moon and Sun are
		receiving bad aspects like square, opposition, conjunction etc., from the lord of 4, 6, 8 or 12, only short life
		is indicated. This is how the westerners proceed, they say that the ascendant, its lord and the Moon indicate
		the consultant's health and longevity. They add that lord of the ascendant retrograde or deposited in 8, or lord
		of 8 in one, or malefics occupying one and 8 will cause short life. To note for how many more years one would
		live, they calculate as follows: If the lord of the ascendant will form either conjunction or square or
		opposition with Sun or to the lord of 8, 6 or 4, calculate how many degrees he is away from that planet. Then
		calculate according to the rules given already.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4"><b class="calibre7">Krishnamurti Padhdhati: </b>Note the sub-lord of the ascendant. If he is
		deposited in the constellation of the significators of badhakasthana and marakasthana the life will be short
		after the time of judgment. It will not be for many years. If sub-lord of the ascendant were to be in the
		constellation of the significator of sixth house, the person will suffer from disease but will not succumb to
		it; but if the sub-lord of the ascendant is deposited in the constellation of the significator of the 8th house,
		he will meet with accident. If the sub-lord of the ascendant in the Horary Chart is the significator of the 12th
		house, he will be in bed for long period and may be admitted in a hospital. Death is indicated only by the
		significators of marakasthana and badhakasthana. According to the strength of the lord of the constellation in
		which the sub-lord of the ascendant is deposited, one is to fix the dasa and the sub-periods. Calculate from the
		horoscope erected for the number (Horary) and work out, after how many years and months, the conjoined period of
		the significators will operate.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Predict that he will live only for so many years and months. Never omit to confirm by taking the
		ruling planets at the moment of judgment.</p>

	<p class="block_4">Number 246 is given for judgment at 5-30 P.M. on 24-10-67</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">By 246 it is meant that Jupiter's sign Pisces, Mercury star Revathi and the sub of Mars is the
		Ascendant.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The sub-lord Mars is in the constellation of Kethu in the 7th house. Hence the death is
		inevitable and by transit when lord of 1, the ascendant conjoins the node in the 7th house, in that year, when
		Sun transits in Sun's star and Kethu sub and when Moon transits the constellation of Rahu or Guru or Kethu, the
		end will come.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Ruling planets: Day lord, Mars. Ascendant is in Aswini, Kethu star, sign is Aries, owned by Mars;
		Moon is in Arudhra. star governed by Rahu and the lord of the sign where Moon is Mercury. Hence the ruling
		planets are Rahu, Mars, Mercury and Kethu. Jupiter and Mars are in Kethu constellation. Since Mercury is in the
		sign and house, where Kethu is, take Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore in the conjoined period of the ruling planets the life must end.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Analysis:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">For death, we must consider the badhakasthana and the marakasthanas. As Pisces is lagna, it is a
		common sign.. 7th house from this sign is badhakasthana. For common sign the 7th house is badhakasthana and
		marakasthana, and Kendhrasthana. So it is trebly evil to cause the death.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, the following are the significators of death:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(a) The planets posited in the constellation of the occupants of badhakasthana and marakasthana.
	</p>
	<p class="block_4">(b) The planets occupying the above said houses </p>
	<p class="block_4">(c) The planets in the constellation of the lords of the above said badhaka and maraka houses.
	</p>
	<p class="block_4">(d) The lords of these houses.</p>
	<p class="block_4">(e) Those which are conjoined with the significators or aspected by them, thereby having
		connection with these matters.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now let us analyse houses 2 and 7.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The second bhava is unoccupied by any planet. Mars is lord of 2 Rahu is in Aries, representing
		Mars. Rahu (a node) is therefore more strong to give the result. Select Rahu. Sun is in Rahu star.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The seventh bhava is occupied by Sun, Kethu and retrograde Mercury.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mercury rules Ashlesha, Jyeshta and Revathi. No planet is in any. Mercury (R) is in the
		constellation of Jupiter and in the sub of retrograde Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun is conjoined with Kethu. Kethu rules Aswini, Makha and Moola. Rahu, Mars and Jupiter are in
		the constellation of Kethu. Jupiter is in 6th sign and aspects both Mars and Rahu. Jupiter is also in sub Rahu,
		a significator of death. Mars is represented by node Rahu. Kethu is also occupant of 7th bhava. Kethu is in the
		constellation of Mars (lord of 2) and in the sub of Venus (lord of 8), a strong significator of death. Finally
		take Rahu, Kethu and Jupiter.)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If we analyse dasa system, the native is running Rahu Dasa, Mercury Bhukti. (Balance 1 year and
		26 days).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus we come to the conclusion that during Rahu Dasa Kethu Bhukti Rahu Anthra. Jupiter Shookshma
		the native will meet with his death.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">I predicted that it would be in the month of May, 1969. (Actually this person died in May 1969.)
	</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334418" class="block_22">What about ailment?</h3>
	<p class="block_4">Health is generally good if the sub-lord of the ascendant is deposited in the constellation of
		the planet occupying the house 1 or 11. But, if the sub-lord of the ascendant is deposited in the constellation
		of a planet which is the significator of 1 and 6, one will suffer from disease during its periods and
		sub-periods. If the sub-lord of the 6th house is deposited in the constellation of a planet which is the
		significator of the 6 and 1 and not of 11, then the sub-lord, during its sub-period, will give the disease. If
		the sub-lord is deposited in a constellation, the lord of which is connected in any manner with Saturn, the
		disease is a chronic one. Even, if the sub-lord is Saturn, the disease is a chronic one. But, if the sub-lord is
		in any manner connected with Mars, it is an acute disease. Mercury shows complications.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334419" class="block_22">Cure When?</h3>
	<p class="block_4">Generally, one falls ill at the time when the conjoined period of the planets connected with the
		6th and the first house in any manner operates; but, the cure comes only when the significator of the 5th or
		11th house follows the period governed by the disease producing 6th house significator. One will survive from
		the disease after the cure, only when his longevity is promised. (For longevity, one has to find out the Bathaka
		Sthana and Maraka Sthana. These will give a clear picture).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As regards the nature of the disease, I have already published what each sign, star and sub
		indicates and said what it would be. Therefore, you have to refer to it and then ascertain which part of the
		body will be affected.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334420" class="block_22">Accident</h3>
	<p class="block_4">In Astrology, there is nothing as Accident. Astrological dictionary does not have this word
		because, for every result, there is a cause. Therefore, even that which the people call as Accident is something
		which happens when least expected. Anything that is a surprise and an unexpected one alone is classified as an
		accident, whether the result is favourable or unfavourable.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore, the sub-lord of the 8th house is to be deposited in the constellation of the planet
		which is the significator of the 8th house. If the significator happens to be also the significator of the 6th
		house, then he will have fever, etc., following the accident. If the same sub-lord is in the star of a planet
		who is also the significator of the 12th, he will be admitted in a hospital. If the sub-lord happens to be the
		significator of Bathaka Sthana, and Makara Sthana; he will succumb to it, provided his longevity is not further
		more promised. If the longevity is promised, he will get over this, and the condition of the patient would be
		threatening. Some may be unconscious; some may be given blood transfusion and also oxygen. Therefore we have to
		judge both the longevity and also the duration of the disease.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334421" class="block_12">ABSENT PERSON ALIVE OR DEAD</h2>
	<p class="block_4"><b class="calibre7">Western system: </b>One is interested to know whether the person who is
		absent, is alive or dead, generally if one happens to be related to the absence. If he is a brother, take the
		third house to represent him. If it is father as per Western theory take the fourth as his ascendant; if it is a
		son take the fifth; if it is wife take the 7th. If there is no relationship take the first house itself to
		represent him (1 do not agree. Because according to me all people not related to the native should be judged
		from the 9th house.) They take lord of 1 and also Moon to represent him. If the lord of lagna and Moon apply
		conjunction or any adverse aspect to the lord of the 8th, he will shortly die. If these two are forming
		separation aspect with lord of 8, and if there is no favourable aspect he is already dead. The number of degrees
		between the significators give the number of months, days etc. (Calculation Cumbersome). If lord of 1 is in 5
		and it is squared by Moon there is the danger of death. If lord of 1 is conjoined with lord of 8 and is in 8 or
		4, he is already dead. This fails when lord of 1 is also lord of 8 and it is in 4 in good constellation.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4"><b class="calibre7">Krishnamurti Padhdhati: </b>Take that house which represents the
		relationship. For father and for strangers take only the 9th house. Find out where the cusp falls. If the sub-
		lord of the cusp is in the constellation of the planet who is the significator of Bhadhaka and Maraka sthanas,
		boldly declare that he is dead. It will prove to be very correct. If this significator is in a watery sign, he
		is drowned; if it is in fiery sign he had received injuries and died. If it is an earthy sign, he had natural
		end. If the sub-lord of the cusp of the house representing the relative is in the constellation of the lord of
		that house or the significators of the house representing that relation he is alive; if that lord is also the
		significator of the sixth house counted from that house representing him, then he is ill.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334422" class="block_22">News about the person When?</h3>
	<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord of the cusp of the third house counted from the ascendant of the horary chart (to
		get news) is in the constellation of the planet who is the significator of 3 and 11, on the day Moon transits
		that (1) position of the zodiac (sign, star and sub) which is governed by the significators of 3 counted from
		the ascendant, (2) 3rd counted from the house representing the relative and the 11th from the ascendant the
		querist will receive the letter. The exact time, will be the moment when the ascendant on that day to the place
		of residence on that day (Latitude and Longitude) governed by the significators just above mentioned, rises in
		the cast. Because a consultant may be wandering here and there in search of the absentee. At the time, he hears
		the news or receives a letter or phone or wire the locality may be different. The position of the ascendant
		varies according to latitude and the time according to longitude even though for a particular moment Sun, Moon
		and the other planets may be in the same position in the zodiac. Position of Moon and the ascendant alone is to
		be judged. In case if the significator is connected with Saturn, find out in which month Sun will reach that
		position of the zodiac.</p>
