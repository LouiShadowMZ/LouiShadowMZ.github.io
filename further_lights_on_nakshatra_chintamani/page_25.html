   Joint period: 1. The native was born during the period of Ketu with balance of 3Y. 3M. 21D. Ketu is in the star and sub Mars. Mars is the owner of the 9th cusp (Scorpio 22°1') the Asc. of the native's father. As counted from the 9th Mars occupies 9 and it is in conjunction with Moon the owner of the father's 9th. So Ketu indicates that at the time of the native's birth his father was in the foreign land.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2. As counted from the 4th cusp (Gemini 17°1′) Mars owns 11 (meeting the kith and kin of the mother) and occupies 2 (family life for the mother). It is in conjunction with Moon owning 2, it is aspected by Jupiter owning 7 (husband of the mother) and Saturn owning 9 (foreign journey for the mother). So Ketu denotes that the mother of the native will be in a position to meet her husband and to lead the family life by going to the foreign land during its period.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3. As for the native Ketu is the significator of 9 and 12 and also connected with 9 and 12; because its star and sub Mars owns 9 and aspects 9 and 12. So he will be able to go to the foreign land during its period.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4. Hints: (a) If the sub lord of the 11th cusp be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 3, 9 or 11 and 12; or connected with 3, 9 or 11 and 12 the native gets his passport, visa and stays abroad.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) The native was born during the joint period of Ketu, Rahu (the sub lord of the 11th cusp) and Venus.
  </p>
<p>
   Rahu occupies 9, it is in the star Mercury and in the sub Mars. The star lord Mercury occupies 3, it is in conjunction with Saturn owning 11 and 12, also Venus owning 3. The sub lord Mars owns 9, aspects 9 and 12 and aspected by Saturn owning 11 and 12. So Rahu is the significator of 3, 9, 11 and 12; also connected with them.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus is in the star and sub Rahu in 9. So it is the significator of 9 and connected with 9. Hence the native had immediately after his birth, to Undergo short travels for passport and visa.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   5. In the joint period of Ketu, Jupiter and Jupiter the native and his mother started for Chicago (U.S.A.) on 22-11-1974.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Jupiter is in the star Jupiter and in the sub Mercury. The star lord Jupiter occupies 12 and the sub lord Mercury occupies 3. So it is the significator of 12 and connected with 3 for the native.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Regarding the mother of the native, as counted from the 4th cusp the star lord Jupiter occupies 9 and the sub lord Mercury occupies 12. So it is the significator of 9 and connected with 12 for the mother.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 22-11-1974 Moon Aquarius 4° was in the sub Venus the sookshma period ruler. Ketu Taurus 17° was in the star Moon the significator of foreign journey. Jupiter Aquarius 15° was in the sub Ketu the period ruler.
