   Hints: If the sub lord of the 10th cusp (profession, vocation, occupation) or 6th cusp (service) be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 10 (profession, either in independent vocation or in service), 2 (bank balance, self-acquisition) or 6 (services rendered, day to day attendance on duty and thereby earning; being 12th from the 7th denotes loss to others and gain to self, hence receiving money from others); or connected with 10, 2 or 6 the native will earn money either by profession or service during the joint period of the significators of 2, 6 and 10.
  </p>
<p>

   11th cusp (Aquarius 20° 16'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Jupiter. It is in the star Saturn and in the sub Moon. Jupiter occupies 11. Its star lord Saturn owns 10 and 11. Its sub lord Moon occupies 1 in Taurus which corresponds to the 2nd house. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 11 is the significator of 10, 11 and connected with 1, 11 and 2. Hence the native will earn much and his aspirations will be fulfilled.

   Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Rahu are the significators. Ketu in Aries represents Mars. Saturn and Ketu are in the sub Venus. So Ketu and Saturn should be considered.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: 1. The native was born during the period of Sun with balance of 1Y 10M 2D. His education was completed during the joint period of Rahu, Rahu and Mars in June 1961.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2. During the joint period of Rahu, Rahu and Mars he got his first service on 17-7-1961.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3. During the joint period of Rahu, Saturn and Rahu he got another appointment in the Mills on 14-2-1966.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Saturn the sub period ruler owns 10 and 11. It is in the star Ketu in 12 (change in environments). It is in the sub Venus owning 1 (change in income). Ketu and Venus are discussed above. So Saturn is the significator of 12, 10, 11 and connected with 1 and 10. Hence it denotes a beneficial change in service.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu the inter period ruler is in the star Mars in 11 and in the sub Mercury owning 2, 3 and occupying 9. So Rahu is the significator of 11 (gain) and connected with 2 (money), 3 (change in evironments) and 9 (change in job). Hence the native got a job in the Mills better than the former one.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
