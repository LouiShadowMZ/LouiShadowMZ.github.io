   Example Nativities - 14.Cancer
  </h1>
<p>
   Hints: 1. If the sub lord of the Asc. (health) be in the star of the occupant of the house 1 or 11, the health is normal.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the sub lord of the Asc. be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of the house 6 (sickness) or 8 (danger to life) or 12 (hospitalisation), it is not good for health.
  </p>
<p>
   The native may suffer from sickness or disease, during the joint period of the significators of 1 and 6, also during the sub periods of the significators of 1 and 6 or 1 and 8 or 1 and 12 in the period of the significator of 6.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.(a) If the sub lord of the 6th cusp (disease) be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 6 or 8 or 12 and connected with 1, the native may suffer from disease or otherwise, during the sub period of this cuspal sub lord of 6.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) If the sub lord of the 6th cusp be connected with Saturn, disease becomes chronic; if with Mars disease is acute, sudden and painful and causes operations; if with Mercury disease gets complicated; and if with Rahu or Ketu disease remains undiagnosed. Rahu is similar to Saturn and Ketu is similar to Mars in effects.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (c) Similarly, if the sub lord of the 8th or 12th cusp be the significator of 6 or 8 or 12 and connected with 1, the native suffers from serious sickness or chronic disease or the disease which might bring some permanent defect.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4. If the sub lord of the 6th or 8th or 12th or 11th cusp be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 1, 5 or 11 (Ist health, 5th is 12th to 6 absence of disease, 11th is 12th to 12 absence of bed ridden sickness or hospitalisation) disease is cured or the native is saved from any danger or otherwise, during the joint period of the significators of 1, 5 and 11.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Discretion has to be used in selecting the sub lord of the 6th or 8th or 12th cusp in judging disease, defect, deformity or bodily injury etc.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   5. The parts of the body denoted by :
  </p>
<p>
   (a) the sign and house occupied by the cuspal sub lord of 6 or 8 or 12;
  </p>
<p>
   (b) the sign and house occupied by the star lord of the above cuspal sub lord;
  </p>
<p>
   (c) the cuspal sub lord of 6 or 8 or 12;
  </p>
<p>
   (d) the star lord of this cuspal sub lord;
  </p>
<p>
   (e) the malefics connected with 6 or 8 or 12 are likely to be affected by disease.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   6th cusp (Scorpio 7° 5'): In this horoscope Gemini 9° 11' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 6th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star and sub Venus. Mercury owns 1 and occupies 11. The star and the sub Venus owns 12 and occupies 11. So it is the significator of 12, 11 and connected with 12, 11 and 1.

   Mercury and Venus both are in conjunction with the owner of 8 Saturn and Rahu; they are aspected by the owner of the badhaka house 7 (JupiterR) and the owner of 6 Mars.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus the cuspal sub lord of 6 is connected with 1,6,8,12; the badhaka house; 11; Mercury (complication), Venus (wasting disease), Saturn (chronic), Rahu (chronic and disease beyond diagnosis), Jupiter (malignancy), Mars (sudden, acute and painful). So the native is likely to suffer from an incurable disease.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8th cusp (Capricorn 3° 5') The sub lord of the 8th cusp is Saturn. It is in the star and sub Venus. So the positon will be according as above. Hence the native may die of an incurable disease. The afflictions are in the cardinal signs. So the parts denoted by the cardinal signs may be affected by the disease.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   ASC (Gemini 9° 11'): The sub lord of the Asc. is Jupiter. It is in the star Rahu and in the sub Mars. Jupiter owns the angle, it occupies the 5th, aspects the Asc. The star lord Rahu occupies 11. The sub lord Mars owns 6. So the sub lord of the Asc. is the strong significator of 11 and connected with 6; 1, 5 and 11. Hence the native will maintain normal health in general for long.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   We may now view the sub lord of the Asc. in a different manner. Jupiter is the owner of the badhaka house 7. It is aspected by the owner of 8 Saturn and the owner of 12 Venus. So it becomes malefic and afflicted. Its star lord Rahu is in conjunction with the owner of 8 Saturn and the owner of 12 Venus; and aspected by the owner of 6 Mars. So Rahu also becomes malefic and afflicted. Its sub lord Mars owns 6 and aspected by the owner of 8 Saturn. So Mars also becomes malefic and afflicted. Hence the sub lord of the Asc. Jupiter becomes heavily afflicted and malefic in effect. It is connected with the badhaka and maraka houses; 6, 8 and 12 also.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Ketu with balance of 5Y. 1M. 3D. This horoscope denotes long life. So after 66 years of age we have to think about the disease in particular.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The period of Jupiter commences from 12-5-1977. It is connected with 6, 8, 12 and the badhaka-maraka houses. So its period is dangerous for life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   We have earlier observed that the cuspal sub lords of 6 and 8 are connected with the badhaka-maraka houses; also 6, 8 and 12. Hence during the sub periods of these cuspal sub lords the native may suffer from disease.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   So during the joint period of Jupiter (the cuspal sub lord of the Asc. and the badhaka house), Saturn and Saturn (the cuspal sub lord of 8) in July 1979 it was detected that the native was affected by cancer in oesophagus.
