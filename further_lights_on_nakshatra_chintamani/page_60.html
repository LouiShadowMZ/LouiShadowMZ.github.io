   Example Horary Maps - 5. Marriage
  </h1>
<p>
   Query: What about my marriage, marriage partner and her education ?
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moon: In this horary map Moon occupies 7 and it is aspected by the owners of 7 (Jupiter) and 11 (Mars), its star lord Sun and Venus. Thus Moon clearly indicates that the querent is very eager to know about his marriage problem.

   aspecting 7. It is in the sub Moon owning 2 and occupying 7. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 7 is the significator of 11, 7 and connected with 2 and 7. Hence it promises marriage. None of them is retrograde.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) Consider the 7th cusp as the Asc. of the marriage partner. Now as counted from the 7th cusp Pisces 22° 10' becomes the 4th cusp (education) for the marriage partner. Its sub lord is Sun, it owns the 9th (higher education), it is in the star Mercury and in the sub Venus owning 11 of the marriage partner. All these three planets are in conjunction with Jupiter owning 4 of the marriage partner. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 4 of the marriage partner is connected with Mercury, Jupiter, 4, 9 and 11. Sun, Mercury and Jupiter are in Cancer which is on the 8th cusp and all of them are aspected by the owner of 8 (medicine, pharmacy, chemicals, microbiology and such other subjects correlated with the 8th house) Moon for the marriage partner. Hence the marriage partner's education might be connected with these subjects. Further Sun and Jupiter have connection with medicine.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (c) The disposition of the marriage partner may be learnt from the cuspal sub lord of the 7th (Mars). So Mars in Gemini signifies impulsive but adaptable nature.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: (a) At the time of judgment (Sun period with balance of 1Y. 3M. 12D.) the querent was running the joint period of Sun and Ketu which will last upto 19-11-1979.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   So far as the marriage partner is concerned, the period ruler Sun is the cuspal sub lord of 4 (education for the marriage partner); while the sub period ruler Ketu is the cuspal sub lord of 11 (success in education to the marriage partner). Ketu is in the star Rahu in 8 and in the sub Venus owning 11 for the marriage partner. So the marriage partner will be completing her studies before 19-11-1979.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) The joint period of Sun, Venus and Venus starts from 19-11-1979 and continues upto 19-1-1980. Sun, its star Mercury and its sub Venus are all connected with the owner of 7 (Jupiter) in 2 and owner of 2 (Moon) in 7. So Sun becomes the significator of marriage. Venus is the natural significator of marriage, it is in the star Saturn and in the sub Jupiter. So far as the querent is concerned the star lord Saturn occupies 2 and the sub lord Jupiter owns 7 and occupies 2. So far as the marriage partner is concerned the star lord Saturn owns 2 and aspects the 11th; while the sub lord Jupiter is in conjunction with Venus owning 11. Thus the sub and the inter period ruler Venus is fruitful to both of them for getting married.

   2.The querent informed me that the girl of his choice was very impulsive and she was an M.B.B.S student. Her examination was over on 6-11-1979. She passed her M.B.B.S examination in December 1979. They both moved together as man and wife from 22-12-1979. It was learnt that he secretly married the girl on 23-1-1980 during the joint period of Sun, Venus and Sun. At the time of judgment Mercury the star lord of Sun was retrograde (it turned direct from 11-8-1979, hence the marriage) and Saturn the star lord of Venus was in conjunction with Rahu in 2. Hence no celebration of marriage in a usual way.
  </p>

</p>
<p>
   Transit: On 23-1-1980 Sun Capricorn 9° was in its own star the period and the inter period ruler.
