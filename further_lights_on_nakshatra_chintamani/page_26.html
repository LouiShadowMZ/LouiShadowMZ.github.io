Rahu in Pisces as a representative of Jupiter owns 4. Its star lord Mercury is in conjunction with Venus owning 9 and aspected by the owner of 11 (Moon). Its sub lord Jupiter owns and occupies 4. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 4 is connected with Mercury, Jupiter and the houses 4, 9 and 11. Hence the native will get academic qualifications.

   12th cusp (Leo 6° 40'): The sub lord of the 12th cusp Rahu is in the star Mercury and in the sub Jupiter. The star lord Mercury is in 12, it is in conjunction with the owner of 9 (Venus). The sub lord Jupiter aspects the 9th. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 12 is the significator of 12 and connected with 9. Hence the foreign journey is promised. The sub Jupiter owns and occupies 4, but it is retrograde. So the native will not be steady at one place.

   Joint period: 1. The native was born during the period of Jupiter with balance of 14Y. 0M. 0D.. Thereafter, the period of Saturn (the sub lord of the 3rd and 9th cusps) commences from 11-8-1963. If the period ruler be the significator of the desired matter, an event regarding the desired matter occurs during the joint period of the period ruler, its star lord and its sub lord. So in this case during the joint period of Saturn, Venus and Venus the native started for America on 8-8-1970.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits. On 8-8-1970 Sun Cancer 21° was in the sub Venus the sub and inter period ruler. Moon Virgo 22° was in the sub Venus. Saturn Aries 29° was in the sub Mars the sookshma period ruler.

  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thereafter, he went to Nepal during the joint period of Saturn, Mars and Venus in December 1976 and returned in January 1977.

  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Saturn (the sub lord of the 3rd and 9th cusps) and Rahu (the sub lord of the 12th cusp) are the strong significators of 12 (stay abroad). The joint period of Saturn and Rahu will last upto 29-1-1980. The houses 3, 9 and 12 show dynamic life, wandering from one place to another and changing environments. So the native will not be steady at one place till 29-1-1980.

   12th cusp (Aries 13° 17'): The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Moon and in the sub Saturn. The star lord Moon owns 3 and the sub lord Saturn owns 9. Mercury occupies 12, it is in association with the owner of 12 (Mars) and aspected by the owner of 9 (Saturn). Thus the cuspal sub lord of 12 is the significator of 3 and connected with 9 and 12. Hence the foreign journey is promised to the native.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the sub lord of the 11th cusp be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 3, 9 or 12, the native fulfils his desire to go abroad. In this case Mercury is the sub lord of the 11th cusp (Pisces 6° 37'). So the native's desire to go abroad will be fulfilled.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: 1. The native was born during the period of Jupiter with balance of 4Y. 6M. 25D. Thereafter, the periods of Saturn and Mercury will follow in succession. Mercury is both the cuspal sub lord of 11 and 12 and it is the strong significator of foreign travel. So the native will go abroad during the period of Mercury.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2. In fact during the joint period of Mercury (owning 2), Venus (owning 6) and Saturn (owning 9, 10) the native started for America on 30-5-1978. Venus is in the star Rahu in 11 and in the sub Jupiter owning 11 and occupying 9. So the native could fulfil his desire by going abroad. Saturn is the sub lord of the period ruler Mercury and it is also the owner of 9. Hence the foreign journey.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3. The main object of going abroad is to earn money and improve financial prospects. Mercury is the cuspal sub lord of 2, 6 and 11. Venus is the cuspal sub lord of 10. So the native could go abroad during the joint period of Mercury and Venus for improving his financial prospects.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 30-5-1978 Sun Taurus 14° 35' was in the star Moon the significator of foreign journey. Moon Aquarius 24° was in the sub Mercury the period ruler. Venus Gemini 16° was in its own sub the sub period ruler. Saturn Leo 1° 14' was in the sub Venus.
