   Moon: In this horary map Moon owns 4 (studies), it is in conjunction with Jupiter owning 9 (research), 12 and in 12 (stay in a foreign land). It is in the star Mercury and in the sub Saturn. Its star lord Mercury owns 6, 3, occupies 9 and aspects the 4th. Its sub lord Saturn owns 11, occupies 3 and aspects the 6th. So Moon is the significator of 6 (scholarship), 3 (completion or postponement of studies), 9 (research), 4 (studies) and connected with 11 (gain), 3 and 6. Thus the query refers to the scholarship regarding the research studies and the prospects thereto.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Aquarius 8° 59'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Jupiter. It is in the star Mercury and in its own sub. None of them is retrograde. Its star lord Mercury owns 6, occupies 9 and aspects the 4th. Its sub lord Jupiter owns 9, it is in conjunction with the owner of 4 (Moon) and aspects the owner of 11 (Saturn). So the cuspal sub lord of 11 is the significator of 6, 9, 4 and connected with 9, 11 and 4. Hence the querent's desire to get the scholarship regarding the research studies will be fulfilled.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   9th cusp (Sagittarius 14° 59'): The sub lord of the 9th cusp (research studies) is Venus. It is in its own star in the 9th and in the sub Rahu in Libra (Rahu represents Venus). None of them is retrograde. So the cuspal sub lord of 9 is the strong significator of 9. Hence the querent will be able to complete his research work.

   Ruling Planets:

   Day:	Friday	Ven.	-	-

  </p>
<p>
   Moon:	Pisces 28° 14'	-	Jup.	Mer.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu is in Libra, it represents Venus. Ketu is aspected by Saturn, so it represents Saturn. Hence Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are the ruling planets. Saturn is retrograde, but it gets direct from 28-3-1976, so it will give results after this date.

   Joint Period: At the time of judgment (Mercury period with balance of 2Y. 3M. 1D.) the querent was running the joint period of Mercury, Saturn and Mercury, and it continues upto 18-6-1976. Mercury owns 6 (scholarship) and 3 (completion of studies being 12th from the 4th); it is in the star Sun owning 5 (completion of studies being 12th from the 6th competitive examination) and occupying 10 (achievement). So Mercury is the significator of 5 and 10. The scholarship and completion of studies will serve as sources of an event in respect of achievement in studies. Saturn is in its own star and sub; it owns 10, 11 (gain) and occupies 3. So it denotes achievement, gain and completion of studies. Both are among the ruling planets. Hence the querent will be getting the scholarship after 28-3-1976 and before 18-6-1976 in this joint period of Mercury, Saturn and Mercury.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The joint period of Mercury and Saturn continues upto 7-5-1978. So the querent will go on with his research work till this date.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The querent informed me that the scholarship was awarded to him from 5-5-1976 and he completed his research work of PhD. during May 1978.
