<p>
   5th cusp (Virgo 13° 0'): In this horoscope Taurus 24° 5' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 5th cusp is Rahu. It is in the star Mars and in the sub Mercury.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The star lord Mars occupies 2 and it is in the fruitful sign Cancer. The sub lord Mercury owns 2, 5 and occupies 11; it is in the fruitful sign Pisces. Thus this cuspal sub lord is connected with 2, 5, 11 and fruitful signs. Hence child birth is promised.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu the cuspal sub lord is in association with Saturn in the 2nd. Hence child birth is late.

   The star lord Mars owns the maraka houses 7, 12 and aspects the 6th. The sub lord Mercury is aspected by Saturn. Thus this cuspal sub lord is connected with Mars (operation); Saturn and Rahu (obstruction); the houses 6 (sickness), 7 (seriousness) and 12 (hospitalisation). Hence the possibility of caesarean.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Pisces 13° 0'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Rahu. Hence the position as above.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8th cusp (Sagittarius 18° 9'): It denotes operation. So its sub lord may be considered. It is Rahu. Hence the possibility of caesarean.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu's sub lord Mercury is aspected by Jupiter owning 11 and occupying 5. The Asc. and Venus (owning 1 and 6) are aspected by Jupiter. Hence no harm to life.

   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Ketu with balance of 0Y 10M 12D.. Thereafter the native will run the periods of Venus, Sun and Moon respectively. In this case child birth is late. So during the joint period of Moon, Rahu and Jupiter the delivery was effected by caesarean and the native gave birth to a male child on 6-12-1974.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Moon, Jupiter and Rahu another male child was born with the aid of caesarean on 8-4-1977. This child succumbed to its senses immediately twelve hours after birth.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Moon, Mercury and Moon a female child was born by caesarean on 6-9-1979.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The period ruler Moon's star Ketu resembles Mars in effect while Rahu and Jupiter are in the star Mars. Hence the caesarean.
