   Example Nativities - 10. Murder
  </h1>
<p>
   ASC (Scorpio 4° 51'): The sub lord of the Asc. is Saturn. It is a malefic, it is retrograde, it owns 3 and 4 (other than 1, 5, 9 or 10 and 6, 8 or 12). It is in the star and sub Venus; Venus owns the maraka houses 7 and 12. Venus is in mutual aspect to Saturn. So it denotes a middle life (33 to 66 years).

   8th cusp (Gemini 4° 21'): The sub lord of the 8th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Mars and in the sub Moon. Venus is discussed above. The star lord Mars is retrograde, it owns 1, 6 and occupies 12; it is in conjunction with Rahu and aspected by Saturn. The sub lord Moon owns the badhaka house 9, it is aspected by Mars. So this cuspal sub lord is the significator of the maraka house 12 (unnatural death) and connected with the badhaka house. It is connected with malefics and cardinal signs (Mars in Libra, Moon in Capricorn). Hence it denotes an unnatural death.
