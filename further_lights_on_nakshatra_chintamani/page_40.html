   Example Nativities - 37. Divorce
  </h1>
<p>
   7th cusp (Sagittarius 1° 3'): In this horoscope Gemini 1° 3' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 7th cusp is Venus. It is in its own star and in the sub Mercury. It is a natural significator of marriage and in conjunction with the owner of 2 (Mercury). Hence it promises marriage.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The 7th cusp is jointly ruled by Jupiter (sign lord), Ketu (star lord) and Venus (sub lord). Jupiter is in the star Mercury and in the sub Venus. Ketu is in the star Venus and in the sub Mars. Venus is in the star Venus and in the sub Mercury. So the joint rulers of the 7th cusp are controlled by Venus, Mars and Mercury respectively as their sub lords.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus owns 6, Mars owns 12 and Mercury owns 1. Venus and Mercury are retrograde. They both are surrounded by the malefics Ketu and Saturn (owner 10). So they in the last instance indicate negation of married life. Hence the possibility of separation or divorce.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Pisces 21° 32'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Venus. So as discussed above it denotes separation or divorce.

   6-6-1976 during the joint period of the marriage significators Venus, Rahu and Jupiter.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Venus, Rahu and Saturn the native went to her parents' house on 25-1-1977. Thereafter she did not return to her husband's house.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   So during the joint period of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn the husband of the native took divorce on 22-7-1979 according to the customs and conventions of the caste.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   It may be noted that Venus and Jupiter the joint rulers of the 7th cusp are the significators of marriage and divorce both. Rahu is aspected by Venus and Saturn is aspected by Jupiter. So both Rahu and Saturn also become the significators of marriage and divorce. Hence all these planets have played their respective roles both of marriage and divorce.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 22-7-1979 Sun Cancer 5° 30' was in the star Saturn the inter period ruler. Venus Gemini 25° 40' was in the star Jupiter the sub period ruler. Saturn Leo 17° 49' was in the star Venus the period ruler.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Ruling Planets and Affinity:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hints: If the ruling planets of A at birth be the significators of 6, 8 or 12 and not of 1, 5 or 11 in the horscope of B, A will not suit B and during the joint period of the significators of 6, 8 and 12 in the horscope of B, B will not feel happy with A.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Ruling planets of the native at birth are as under.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Day lord	Sign lord	Star lord
  </p>
<p>
   Day.	Monday	Moon	-	-
  </p>
<p>
   Asc.	Gemini 1° 3'	-	Mercury	Mars
  </p>
<p>
   Moon.	Pisces 20° 10'	-	Jupiter	Mercury
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The native was born before sunrise, hence Monday instead of Tuesday. The ruling planets are Moon, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In the horoscope of her husband (Page 147). Moon and Jupiter are in the star of the owner of 12 (Jupiter). Mars and Mercury are in the star of the owner of 6 and the occupant of 12 (Mercury).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus the ruling planets of the native are the strong significators of 12 and 6 in the horoscope of her husband. Hence divorce was the only alternative.
