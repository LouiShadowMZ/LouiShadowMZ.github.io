   maraka houses, it is connected with the maraka houses and Mars. So it denotes the possibility of a serious disease and operations.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Sun with balance of 0Y 10M 5D. Planets in the star of the occupant of 8 are the strong significators of 8. So during the joint period of these significators and the cuspal sublord of 8, it is likely that the native might suffer from a serious disease and she might have to undergo operations.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In this horoscope Jupiter owns and occupies 8, it is retrograde. There is no planet in its star, so it is the strong significator of 8. Saturn is in the star Moon in 8 and in the sub Jupiter owning 8. So it is the stronger significator of 8 than Jupiter.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The period of Saturn starts from 30-3-1965 and continues upto 30-3-1984. During the joint period of Saturn and Rahu (12-11-1978 to 18-9-1981) from November 1978, the native was getting weaker day by day. Thereafter, during the joint period of Saturn, Rahu and Jupiter (29-3-1979 to 1-8-1979) she was operated on 9-5-1979 and her rectum and uterus were removed because of cancer in these parts of the body.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 9-5-1979 Sun Aries 24°19′ and Moon Virgo 19° were in the sub Mercury the sookshma period ruler. Rahu Leo 20°59′ was in the sub Jupiter the inter period ruler. Jupiter Cancer 8°24′ was in the star Saturn the period ruler.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Cancer-Uterus Rectum :
  </p>
<p>
   The period ruler Saturn's star Moon and sub Jupiter both are in the 8th. The 8th house governs the rectum and uterus in the female's horoscope. Further Moon and Jupiter indicate diseases like cancer. Hence cancer in these parts of the body.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub period ruler Rahu's star Saturn is a natural malefic, it is placed in Taurus and aspects Scorpio. It is found that affliction in any sign affects the sign in opposition to it. So Saturn affects the rectum and uterus which are governed by Scorpio. Cancer was developed during the sub period of Rahu.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The inter period ruler Jupiter is in the star Venus and in the sub Mercury. Jupiter owns 8, so the serious disease becomes the source. Its star lord Venus owns 1,6 and occupies 11. Its sublord Mercury owns 2, 9 and occupies 12. So Jupiter is the significator of 6 (disease); 1, 11 (remedy) and connected with 2 (danger), 12 (hospitalisation) and 5 (remedy). The star lord Venus being in Aries is deemed to be connected with Mars. Hence the operation served as the remedial measure of the disease in the inter period of Jupiter.
