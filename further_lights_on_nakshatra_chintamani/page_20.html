   Rahu and Moon and also aspected by the badhaka lord Jupiter and by the owner of 6 Saturn. Rahu denotes the disease which may not be diagnosed. Jupiter indicates tumours and abcesses. Moon and cardinal sign signify uterus.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In this case the water and cardinal signs, Moon, Jupiter, Saturn and Rahu are interrelated. Subsequently it was diagnosed that the native suffered from the malignant (cancerous) tumour in the uterus.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu in the 6th being in the star and the sub Saturn owning 6 is the significator of 6.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Sun in the 6th owns 12, it is in the star Jupiter the owner of the badhaka house 7 and in the sub Ketu in the 12th. So it is the strong significator of the badhaka house 7 and connected with 12. It is also in conjunction with the owner of 8 Mars. Hence Sun in the 6th is the most malefic in effect. Further it is the cuspal sub lord of the badhaka house 7.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Mercury with balance of 11Y OM. 18D. The period of Sun started from 27-3-1970 and continued upto 27-3-1976. During this time the native suffered much from the disease.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the period ruler is the significator of an expected event, the event occurs during the joint period of the period ruler, its star lord and its sub lord. So during the joint period of Sun, Ketu (its sublord) and Jupiter (its star lord) the native died of cancer on 4-2-1975.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub period ruler Ketu is in the star Sun owning 12 and occupying 6 and in the sub Saturn owning 6 So it is the significator of 6 and 12 and connected with 6.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The inter period ruler Jupiter owns the badhaka house 7, it is in the star Mercury owning 1 and occupying 6 and in the sub Venus, owning the maraka house 2 in the badhaka-maraka house 7. So it is the significator of 1, 6 and connected with the badhaka and maraka houses.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 4-2-1975 Moon Scorpio 0° 1' was in the star Jupiter the inter period ruler. Jupiter Aquarius 26° 35' was in its own star. Sun Capricorn 21° 7' was in the star Moon the significator of 6. Ketu Taurus 13° 22′ was in the star Moon.
