   Example Nativities - 7. Burning

<p>
   ASC (Gemini 7° 53'): The sub lord of the Asc. is Rahu. It is in the star Moon and in the sub Mercury. Rahu in Taurus becomes the owner of 12 and 5 as the representative of Venus, so it denotes a middle life in the first instance. But Rahu is in 12 and aspected by Mars owning 6, so it becomes afflicted. The star lord Moon owns the maraka house 2 and it is aspected by the owner of the badhaka house 7 (Jupiter), the owner of the 8th (Saturn) and the owner of the maraka-salvation house 12 (Venus), so it is also afflicted and becomes malefic. The sub lord Mercury owns the Asc. but it is in association with Ketu and Mars owning 6 and it is also the significator of the badhaka house (in the star Jupiter), so it becomes malefic. Hence the sub lord of the Asc. becomes both badhaka and maraka, so it denotes a short life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The Asc. sub lord (Rahu), its star (Moon) and its sub (Mercury) are in the violent signs e.g. Taurus, Aries and Scorpio respectively. The Asc. sub lord is connected with malefics (Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu). It is connected with 8, 12 and the badhaka house. So the native will meet with an unnatural death.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The affliction is in the martial signs (Aries and Scorpio) with Mars and Ketu (accident by fire). So there is danger from fire.

   8th cusp (Capricorn 1° 30'): The sub lord of the 8th cusp is Jupiter. It is in its own star and in the sub Saturn. The star lord Jupiter owns the badhaka house 7, it is in conjunction with the owner of 12 and aspected by the owner of 2, so it becomes afflicted and malefic. The sub lord Saturn owns 8 and occupies 2; both Jupiter and Saturn are in cardinal signs. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 8 is the significator of the badhaka house and connected with 8 and 12, also the malefic and cardinal signs. So it denotes an unnatural death.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   12th cusp (Taurus 5°30'): The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Jupiter and in the sub Moon. They all are discussed above. Hence the unnatural death from fire.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Venus with balance of 9Y. 8M. 12D. Thereafter the native is to run the periods of Sun, Moon, Mars and Rahu etc, respectively. As the unnatural death from fire and also the short life are indicated, it is possible that an event may occur during the period of Mars (18-8-1972 to 18-8-1979). Mars is in the star Mercury and in the sub Saturn owning 8 and occupying 2. They all are discussed above.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   So Mars signifies the accident by fire and unnatural death. During the joint period of Mars, Mars, Jupiter (the cuspal sub lord of 8) and Rahu (the sub lord of the Asc.) while taking down the hot water pot, the native's garment caught the flame of the stove and her whole body was burnt on 6-10-1972 in the morning and she died at 8-0 P.M. I.S.T. on the same day.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 6-10-1972 Moon Virgo 11° 44' was in the sub Mars (the period and sub period ruler). Jupiter Sagittarius 7°47' was in its own sub (the inter period ruler). Rahu Sagittarius 28°27' was in the sub Mars. Mars Virgo 10° 13' was in the star Moon the maraka-badhaka significator.
