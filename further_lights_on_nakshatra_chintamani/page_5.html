<p>
   The sub lord Rahu (diplomat) is in Pisces (psychic research) in the 10th (aims, ambitions). It is aspected by the owner of 8 (mystery) Jupiter (philosopher) and the owner of 12 (Mars).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus the sub lord of the Asc. is connected with 1, 8 and 10. Hence the native dexterously presents the philosophy of life in a radical and revolutionary way.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The majority of planets are in fire signs. So the idea of self-restraint as depicted by the native is unique. The realistic sign Taurus is on the Asc. Venus is the owner of Asc., it is also the sub lord of the Asc. Moreover, Venus is in its own star. Venus stands for the realistic enjoyment of life. Thus the native's philosophy of life is based on the realistic way of enjoying life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Pisces 9° 12'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Venus. Hence as discussed above the native enthrals the mass including the intelligentia by his convincing arguments and reasoning. Thus he is successful in preaching his doctrine or philosophy of life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   This is the horoscope of one who is a revolutionary thinker, philosopher and critic.
