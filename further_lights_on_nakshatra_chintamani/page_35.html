   10th cusp (Aquarius 29° 1'): 1. In this horoscope Gemini 10°1' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 10th cusp is Sun. It is in the star Ketu and in the sub Saturn. Sun is on the 7th cusp. The star lord being in Sagittarius becomes the representative of Jupiter; so it is the owner of the 7th and is on the 7th cusp. The sub lord Saturn owns the 10th. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 10 is the strong significator of 7 and connected with 10. Hence the native will do an independent vocation during the joint period of the significators of 2, 7 and 10.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2 (a) Leo, Sun and Jupiter denote medical line or knowledge. Scorpio and Mars chemicals and drugs. Virgo corresponds to the 6th and denotes nursing, medical treatment to the sick. Pisces corresponds to the 12th house and signifies hospitals or clinics or nursing homes. Sagittarius pharmaceutical knowledge.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) The cuspal sub lord of 10 Sun is in the star Ketu and in the sub Saturn. Sun denotes the medical line. The star lord Ketu represents Mars; both Sun and Ketu are in Sagittarius (pharmaceutical knowledge); they are in the 6th which denotes medical treatment to the sick; they are in conjunction with the owner of 12 (hospitals, clinics) Venus. The sub lord Saturn (owning 10 occupation, owning 9 luck) is in aspect to Sun, Ketu, the owner of 12 (Venus) and Jupiter (medical knowledge). Hence the native is a doctor. As Sun is connected with the malefics Rahu, Ketu and Saturn owning 8 (operations) the native is a surgeon.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2nd cusp (Cancer 4°1'): The sub lord of the 2nd cusp is Saturn. It is in the star Jupiter and in the sub Moon. Saturn owns 10. The star lord Jupiter owns 7. The sub lord Moon owns 2. So the cuspal sub lord of 2 is the significator of 7 and connected with 2 and 10.
  </p>
<p>
   9
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moreover, the star lord Jupiter is aspected by the owner of 6 and 11 (Mars); the sub lord Moon is aspected by the owner of 10. The cuspal sub lord Saturn is aspected by Jupiter owning 7. Hence the cuspal sub lord of 2 is also connected with 6, 10 and 11; Mars and Jupiter (the planets denoting medical profession).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   So the native will carve his career successfully during the joint period of the significators of 2, 6, 10 and 11; and he will earn independently.
