   Example Nativities - 13.Amputation
  </h1>
<p>
   12th cusp (Leo 13°42'): The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Saturn and in the sub Mars. The star lord Saturn aspects the 8th and is aspected by Mars, it is in Libra (conducive to accidents). The sub lord Mars owns 8 and aspects the Asc. So the cuspal sub lord of 12 is the significator of 8 (accident) and connected with 1, 8, malefics Mars and Saturn and cardinal sign. Hence the possibility of an accident.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8th cusp (Aries 12°42'): The sub lord of the 8th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Venus. Mercury owns the Asc. and aspects the 11th. It is in Capricorn (leg). The star lord Sun owns 12, it is in association with Rahu (mutilation) in Sagittarius (leg) and aspected by Saturn (bruises) owning 6. The sub lord Venus owns the maraka house 2 and it is the strong significator of 8 as discussed above. So the cuspal sub lord of 8 is the significator of 12 (hospitalisation, mutilation) and connected with 6 (sickness); 2, 8 (danger); 1, 11 (remedy); Rahu and Saturn; and signs governing the leg. Hence the native's leg is likely to be amputed.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Venus with balance of 6Y 4M 6D. An accident is caused during the period of the significator of 8 and 12, in the sub period of the cuspal sub lord of 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In this horoscope Moon and Mars are the strong significators of 12 and 8 respectively, because there is no planet in their stars. The period of Moon precedes that of Mars. So during the joint period of Moon and Venus (the cuspal sub lord of 12) the native may meet with an accident.

<p>
   Marriage :
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   1.Hints: If the sub lord of the 5th cusp (love affair) be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 2 or 11; or connected with 2 or 11 it denotes a love affair and if it be connected with Rahu or Ketu the love affair with a person belonging to a different caste, creed or province.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the sub lord of the 7th cusp (marriage) be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 5 or 11; or connected with 5 or 11 it denotes marriage with the person of love affair and if it be connected with Rahu or Ketu marriage with the person belonging to a different caste, creed or province.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If Venus be connected with Rahu or Ketu it denotes marriage with the person belonging to a different caste, creed or province.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the sub lord of the 7th cusp be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 2, 7 or 11; or connected with 2, 7 or 11 the native marries during the joint period of the significators of 2 (addition to the family), 7 (wife or husband, legal tie) and 11 (permanent tie of friendship).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   7th cusp (Pisces 12° 54'): The sub lord of the 7th cusp is Rahu. It is in the star Ketu and in the sub Mercury. Rahu in Sagittarius as a representative of Jupiter owns 7. The sub-lord Mercury is aspected by the owner of 7 Jupiter. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 7 is connected with 7, so it promises marriage.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus (owning 2) and the 7th cusp both are aspected by Jupiter. Hence the marriage at the proper age.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   As the 7th cusp is connected with Rahu and Ketu, the marriage may take place with a person belonging to a different caste, creed or province.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub lord of the 7th cusp Rahu is aspected by the owner of 5 (Saturn) and it is in association with the owner of 12 (Sun). Rahu's sub lord Mercury owns the Asc. and is on the 5th cusp and in mutual aspect to the owner of 7 Jupiter. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 7 is connected with 1 (native), 5 (love affair), 7 (marriage) and 12 (hospital.) So the native's episode of marriage may be connected with love affair and hospital.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   5th cusp (Capricorn 12°42'): The sub lord of the 5th cusp is Rahu. So it is connected with 1, 5, 7 and 12. Hence the native will have a love affair in the hospital with a girl belonging to a different caste, creed or province and he will marry her.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Cancer 12°42′): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Mars. It is in the star and sub Saturn. Saturn owns 5 and occupies 2, it aspects the owner of 7 (Jupiter) and the owner of 12 (Sun). So the cuspal sub lord of 11 (permanent relationship) is the significator of 2, 5 and connected with 2, 5, 7 and 12. Hence the native will surely marry the girl as discussed above.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Venus with balance of 6Y-4M-6D.. The period of Mars (the cuspal sub lord of 11) commenced from 18-5-1977 and there was a love affair going on between the native and a nurse in the hospital during the joint period of Mars and Rahu (15-10-1977 to 3-11-1978).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of the significators of marriage e.g. Mars, Jupiter (the owner of 7) and Rahu (the cuspal sub lord of 7), the native got married with the nurse on 7-10-1979.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 7-10-1979 Moon Aries 8° 4' was in the sub Jupiter (the sub period ruler). Mars Cancer 13° 39′ was in the sub Rahu (the inter period ruler). Jupiter Leo 7° 59′ was in its own sub. Sun Virgo 19° 50' was in the star of Moon the significator of marriage.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.Hints: If the sub lord of the 7th cusp be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 1, 6 or 10; or connected with 1, 6 or 10, it does not promise conjugal life, else it denotes absence of married life one way or the other. The sub lords of the 11th and 2nd cusps may also be considered likewise. The event in this respect occurs during the joint period of the significators of 1, 6 and 10.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   7th cusp (Pisces 12° 54'): Rahu the cuspal sub lord of 7 is associated with the owner of 12 (separation) Sun and aspected by the owner of 6 (absence of married life) Saturn. Its star lord Ketu is on the 10th cusp (absence of permanent relationship). It is aspected by Sun and Mars owning 8. Its sub lord Mercury owns 1 and 10. So the cuspal sub lord of 7 is the significator of 10 and connected with 1, 6, 10 and 12. Hence bewilderment in married life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Cancer 12° 42'): Mars the cuspal sub lord of 11 owns 8 and occupies 6, it aspects the Asc. Its star and sub Saturn owns 6, it is aspected by Mars and it aspects the owner of 12 (Sun). So the cuspal sub lord of 11 is the significator of 6 and connected with 1, 6 and 12. Hence bewilderment in married life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Short Life:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   ASC (Virgo 12° 54'): The sub lord of the Asc. is Rahu. It is in the star Ketu and in the sub Mercury. Rahu is in association with the owner of 12 (Sun) and aspected by the owner of 6 Saturn. So it becomes afflicted and malefic.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The star lord Ketu is aspected by the owner of 12 (Sun) and the owner of 8 Mars. So it becomes afflicted and malefic.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub lord Mercury owns the Asc. and it is aspected by the owner of the badhaka house 7 (Jupiter).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus the Asc. sub lord is connected with the badhaka-maraka houses, 6, 8, 12 and 1. Hence the short life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8th cusp (Aries 12° 42'): The sub lord of the 8th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Venus. Mercury owns the Asc. and it is aspected by the owner of the badhaka house 7 (Jupiter).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The star lord Sun owns 12, it is aspected by the owner of 6 Saturn.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub lord Venus owns the maraka house 2 and it is aspected by the badhaka house owner (Jupiter).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus the cuspal sub lord of 8 is the significator of 12 and connected with the badhaka-maraka houses 7, 2; 6 and 1. Hence the short life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3rd cusp (Scorpio 12° 42'): The sub lord of the 3rd cusp is Mars. It is in the star and sub Saturn. Mars owns 8 and aspects the Asc.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The star and sub lord Saturn owns 6 and occupies the maraka house 2. It is aspected by the owner of 8 Mars. It aspects the owner of 12 (Sun) and the badhaka house owner (Jupiter).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus the cuspal sub lord of 3 is the significator of the maraka house 2 and connected with the badhaka-maraka houses 7, 12; 6, 8 and 1. Hence the short life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Period: The native was born during the period of Venus with balance of 6Y 4M. 6D. At present the native runs the period of Mars owning 8 since 18-5-1977 and it continues up to 18-5-1984. So it is not favourable for longevity.
