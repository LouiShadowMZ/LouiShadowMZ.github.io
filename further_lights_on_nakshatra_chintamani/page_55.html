   Example Horary Maps - Fulfilment of a Query
  </h1>
<p>
   Planet direct or retrograde: Ordinarily in the horary map a planet in direct motion gives results, so a retrograde planet can give results only when it gets direct in motion and when it crosses the point from where it turned retrograde. However this is subject to modification according to experience in individual cases. Further, the meaning of a retrograde planet is to be interpreted according to the nature of a query in each case.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Cuspal sub lord: 1. (a) The cuspal sub lord of a house under query indicates whether the matter signified by that house is promised or not.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) The matter is promised if the cuspal sub lord is the significator (i.e. in the star of the occupant or owner) of that house or any one of the houses under consideration.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (c) If the cuspal sub lord or its sub star lord is retrograde, the matter is promised when they get direct in motion.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (d) If the star lord (of this cuspal sub lord) is retrograde, the matter is not denied but it will not materialise during the period, sub period or inter period of this cuspal sub lord. However, it materialises during the period, sub period or inter period of another significator (of the matter under query) whose star lord is direct in motion.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (e) As each house denotes several particular matters, the chief governor of the matter under query may be taken into account and it should be connected with the star lord of the cuspal sub lord of the house under query.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2 In the horary map the Asc. indicates the efforts of the querent; while the 11th cusp shows the fulfilment of desires or success in general.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   So if the cuspal sub lord of the Asc. or the 11th cusp be the significator of the matter asked, the querent gets success in general.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the cuspal sub lord of the Asc. or the 11th cusp be the occupant of the house 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 or 11; or if it is in the star of the occupant of the house 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 or 11 the querent gets success in all undertakings. (The Asc. denotes success in one's efforts; 2nd monetary gain; 3rd help from others; 6th being 12 to 7 loss to the other and gain to the querent; 10th reputation and 11th stands for profit. So these houses are beneficial to the querent in general).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Significators: 1. The significators show the time of an event.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2. So note the significators of the house or houses which signify the matter asked.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3. Reject that significator which is in the star of a retrograde planet (because it cannot during its period or sub period etc., give the results of its star lord).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4.Out of these significators give preference to those significators which are common among:
  </p>
<p>
   (a) The Ruling Planets and
  </p>
<p>
   (b). The sign lord, star lord and sub lord of the cusp of the house under query.
  </p>
<p>
   (c) The cuspal sub lords of the houses under consideration.
  </p>
<p>
   (d) The joint period rulers at the time of judgment. Discretion should be used while selecting the significators from the above planets.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   5.The query will materialise during the joint period of these significators when the transit agrees.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: At the time of an event Sun, Moon and/or the joint period rulers will be found in the star or sub of the same joint period ruler or rulers.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The hints for judgment given in the previous chapters may be applied also in the horary map.
