   Example Nativities - 41. Separation in Married Life
  </h1>
<p>
   1.7th cusp (Aries 8° 28'): In this horoscope Libra 8° 28' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 7th cusp is Jupiter. It is in the star Mercury and in the sub Jupiter. The star lord Mercury occupies 5, it is in conjunction with the owner of 11 (Sun) and aspected by the owner of 2 and 7 (Mars). The sub lord Jupiter occupies 2. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 7 is the significator of 5 (choice marriage) and connected with 2, 7 and 11. Hence the native had a choice marriage.

   The native got married during the joint period of Mars, Mercury and Jupiter in December 1942 and during the period of Rahu the native and her husband were separated in 1945-46.

   2.So we may now discuss the effects of cuspal sub lords of 7, 11 and 2.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (a) Jupiter the cuspal sub lord of 7 is in the star Mercury owning 12 (separation) and in the sub Jupiter owning 6 (absence of married life). So it is the significator of 12 and connected with 6. Hence the separation in married life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) 11th cusp (Leo 10° 45'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Saturn. It is in the star and sub Rahu. Saturn is retrograde, it occupies both 12th and the 1st cusp (separation); it aspects Mars owning 2 and 7, also Venus in 7; so it obstructs the married life. Its star and sub Rahu occupies 10, it is in the barren sign Leo in conjunction with the owner of 10 (Moon). Thus the cuspal sub lord of 11 is the strong significator of 10 and connected with 1, 10, 12; barren sign and the malefics Rahu and Saturn. So it denotes absence of the married life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (c) 2nd cusp (Scorpio 7° 45'): The sub lord of the 2nd cusp is Ketu. It is in the star and sub Rahu. Hence the absence of the married life as discussed above.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.Periods: The native was born during the period of Sun with balance of 4Y. 5M. 14D.. The native and her husband separated in the period of Rahu which is in the sub Jupiter owning 6. Then followed the periods of Jupiter (the cuspal sub lord of 7) and Saturn (the cuspal sub lord of 11) which as discussed earlier denote the absence of the married life. Hence the separation continues till today.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Despite their living separate they maintain cordial relations with each other. They often meet together and attend social functions at each other's relatives. Both of them hold very high positions of first cadre in the government institutions.
