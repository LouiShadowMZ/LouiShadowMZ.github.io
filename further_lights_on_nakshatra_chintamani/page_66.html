   Transits And Nativities - 4. Service Journey Marriage
  </h1>
<p>
   1.In this birth horoscope we may read the influence of the transitting Saturn, Rahu and Ketu from January 1979 to March 1980 in respect of the service, long journey and marriage of the native.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.Saturn Leo 20° 25'R - 13° 37'D - Virgo 3° 32'R - Leo 28° 52'R. Rahu Leo 27° 46' - 3° 39'. Ketu Aquarius 27° 46' - 3° 39'.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.When Saturn, Rahu and Ketu simultaneously transit in the stars and subs of the significators of finance (2, 6, 11, 10), long journey (3, 9, 12) and marriage (2, 7, 11) in the birth map during a particular year under review, the native is likely to get good results in these affairs.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4.In this birth map Saturn from January 1979 to 4-10-1979 and Rahu from 22-1-1979 to 1-10-1979 both transit in the star Venus the strong significator of 2, 6, 10 and 11. From January 1979 to 28-5-1979 Ketu in the star Jupiter the strong significator of 2. So the native got a very good job on 2-5-1979 during the transits of Saturn in the star and sub

<p>
</p>
<p>
   When the aspect is formed between Sun or Moon and another planet 10° orb may be allowed; and between Sun and Moon an orb of 12°.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   When two planets occupy the same degree of declination, whether north or south, they are in parallel position. Like the conjunction, its nature is variable and an orb of 1° only is allowed.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   A separating aspect is stronger than an applying one, because its effects have already manifested; while the effects of an applying aspect have not yet fully materialised.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   One can resist against the evils of a separating bad aspect, but it is not possible to resist against the evils of an applying bad aspect.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   A planet in bad aspect is termed as a planet in affliction or afflicted or afflicting.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Any nirayana horoscope may be judged according to the principles of the western system of Astrology.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Planets: The human mind is influenced by planets according to their inherent tendencies and this influence works in every walk of life. Desirable influence is felt under good aspects, while undesirable influence is experienced under bad aspects or afflictions.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Signs: They indicate the trend and quality of human mind. They confer power to resist against odd environments or circumstances. The majority of planets in the triplicities signify the trend or element or direction or sphere in which the mind will work; when in the quadruplicities the planets denote the type or quality of the mind.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Houses: They denote the environments, circumstances and conditions of human life. Each house has its own speciality. Each sign is a content and each house is a transparent receptacle. This content when put into the house gives a special quality to it.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The majority of planets in angles, above the horizon and oriental or rising give publicity, power and good position; if they are cadent, below the horizon and occidental or setting the native needs the backing of others for success in life. Rise in life is late; if they are in succedent the progress is slow but steady. The cardinal, fixed and mutable signs will have the same effect as angles, succedent and cadent houses respectively.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Aspects: They indicate opportunities and situations, either easy or difficult, which arise in life. Good aspects bring favourable opportunities or situations; while bad aspects create difficult situations. But they do not obstruct progress or success in life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Sun, Moon, Asc., Mc: Consider them for all spheres in life. If Sun and Moon are well placed by sign, house; well aspected and not afflicted by malefics, they denote a progressive and prosperous life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the Asc. and Mc. be well aspected and not afflicted by malefics, it is a sign of good fortune.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The ruler of the Asc. is very important, if it be weak the native falls in the back-ground and he lacks proper self-expression If it be unaspected by any planet, the native will have to depend upon his own abilities, no help may be expected from others. It should be in any aspect, whether good or bad.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Nature of Planets: Sun gives vitality and pours life in every respect.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moon effects changes and growth in every respect.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mercury is a planet of reason, expression, knowledge and communications of all types.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus brings harmony and unity in every walk of life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mars energises everything. It is constructive if well aspecting and destructive if afflicting.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Jupiter develops and expands all our activities. There is much pomp, show and excess if afflicted.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Saturn stabilises, disciplines and balances everything. It brings difficulties, causes delay and limitations if afflicting.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Uranus is a planet of innovation, deviates from established conditions, works suddenly. It gives sudden gain if well aspected. It brings sudden fall and unexpected adversities if afflicted.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Neptune is limitless and undefined in its action. It works mysteriously. It causes chaos, treachery, fraud and deceit if afflicted.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Pluto is a planet of regeneration and transformation. It over throws the old and replaces the new. It first destroys, then regenerates. It creates sudden disasters with no definite aim.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Directions: The aspects formed by the progressed bodies to the radical (birth) bodies are known as 'Directions'. An orb of only one degree on either side (i.e one degree before and one degree after the formation of the exact aspect) should be allowed. It should be remembered that what is not promised in the birth horoscope should not be predicted under directions.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the radical Asc., Mc, Sun, Moon and planets are well aspected by the progressed bodies, the period will be favourable according to the strength of the radical planets. The inharmonious aspects to the progressed bodies will denote unfavourable period.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the year when there is no direction formed to the radical Sun, Moon, Asc., Mc. or by the progressed Sun to the radical planets, the effects of the transitting major planets should be observed, and also the effects of the aspects formed every month by the progressed Moon should be noted.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits and directions of the same nature produce marked effects.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: The transits of the major planets viz. Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars (especially when retrograde and stationary) their conjunctions in transit and eclipses over the places held by Sun, Moon, Mc. and Asc. in the birth horoscope have appreciable effects on the life and fortune of a person. The transits over the important planets in the birth horoscope have also marked effects. Oppositions, squares and trines are in their order of importance.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   When the transitting planets and the birth (radical) planets have the same declinations, the effects are appreciable.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   An orb of not more than two degrees may be considered on either side.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Eclipses: The effects of the Solar eclipse last for as many years as the eclipse is hours in duration; while those of the Lunar eclipse for as many months as the eclipse is hours in duration. During these eclipse periods the effects are felt when directions or transits excite the eclipse point. When the eclipse falls in angles, in conjunction with or in affliction with the important planets in the horoscope, it is most adverse. The eclipse which falls upon Sun, Moon or Asc. or in affliction with them affects the health and life under severe directions.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Infant Mortality
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Sun is vitality and the physical constitution, Moon governs the functional system of the body, it is most important in the case of a child and also for the female. Asc. and its ruler denote bodily strength and power of resistance. In judging the length of life consider their strength by sign, house and aspects.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Aries, Leo, Libra and Sagittarius are strong vital signs. Taurus, Gemini, Virgo and Scorpio are moderate vital signs. Cancer, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are weak vital signs.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the majority of these are strong by sign, house and well aspected life is long. If the majority of these are afflicted in the 4th (end of life), 6th (sickness), 8th (death) and 12th (hospitalisation) or afflicted by the malefics in the 4th, 6th, 8th and 12th or afflicted by the rulers of the 4th, 6th, 8th and 12th or afflicted in or from angles and are in weak signs and not well aspected by the benefics, the child may die in infancy.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Observe the planets to which Moon applies by aspect after birth. A Solar or Lunar eclipse denotes short life. Affliction from Mars to Moon and that from Saturn to Sun are very bad. Affliction from an elevated planet is bad. If Mars or Jupiter be the ruler of the 4th, 6th, 8th or 12th, it becomes weak in influence. Any aspect from Mars and Sun gives vitality to resist against disease. The good aspects from Mars, Jupiter or Venus help to save life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Health &amp; Disease
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   1.Sun, Moon, Asc., the ruler of the Asc., the ruler of the 6th and planets in the 6th are the significators of health.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If these significators are free from affliction, well placed by sign and house, and well aspected. The health will be good.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.The signs occupied by them denote the delicate parts of the body. If Sun or Moon be afflicted by the malefics, the signs occupied by the malefics indicate the delicate parts of the body.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.The parts of the body denoted by the sign in or from which these bodies (significators of health) are heavily afflicted, become sensitive and easily subject to disorder.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Afflictions in cardinal signs Affect head, stomach, kidney and skin. Fixed signs throat, heart, urino-genital organs and blood; while afflictions in mutable signs affect lungs, intestines, nerves and digestion.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4.If Sun, Moon and the ruler of the Asc. be in the 4th, 6th, 8th or 12th they indicate weak health throughout life. If they are in conjunction with the rulers of 4, 6, 8 or 12 the health is poor. If they are afflicted by the rulers of or the planets in 4, 6, 8 or 12 these afflictions are worse than from other planets or positions.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Directions: If the progressed malefic forms bad aspects to the radical Asc. or the ruler of the Asc. and the afflicted malefic in the birth horoscope, the period is not good for health.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the progressed Sun forms bad aspects to the radical Sun which is afflicted by malefics, also to the radical Asc., 8th cusp, ruler of the Asc., Moon and malefics, the time is bad for health.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the progressed Sun or Asc. forms bad aspects to the radical malefics which are in mutual affliction, the time is bad for health.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mental Qualities
  </p>
<p>
   Sun (inner nature), Moon (manners), Asc. and its ruler (thoughts) denote the type of character. Moon, Mercury and planets in the Ist, 3rd and 9th (mutable and airy signs) influence the mind. So consider their sign, positions and aspects. The quality shown by squares and oppositions is marked in the bracket as under:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Signs: Fire-inspirative; Earth-practical; Air-intellectual; Water-emotional; Cardinal-active and ambitious; Fixed-patient and adamant; Mutable-adaptable and vacillating.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Aries-enterprising (impulsive); Taurus-patient (obstinate); Gemini-adaptable (restless); Cancer-careful (sensitive); Leo-lordly (autocrat); Virgo-discriminative (critical); Libra-judicious (indecisive); Scorpio-penetrative (vindictive); Sagittarius-frank (exaggerative); Capricorn-cautious (suspicious); Aquarius-broad-minded (unconventional); Pisces-imaginative (timid):
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Aspects: Sun or Moon in aspect to :- Mars enterprising (combative), Jupiter generous (vain), Saturn patient (selfish), Uranus strong-willed (uncontrollable), Neptune imaginative (superstitious), Pluto daring (rash).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mercury in aspect to :- Moon imaginative (also excitable), Mars dexterous (also sarcastic), Jupiter judicious (prejudicious), Saturn precise (crooked), Uranus inventive(also eccentric), Neptune artistic (deceptive), Pluto sharp (crafty).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus in aspect to :- Moon affectionate (lavish), Mercury amiable (easy-going), Mars demonstrative (passional), Jupiter chastening (excessive), Saturn loyal (perverted), Uranus romantic (inconstant), Neptune devoted (sensual), Pluto artistic (sensual).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mars in aspect to :- Jupiter enterprising (reckless), Saturn courageous (violent), Uranus fearless (head-strong), Neptune intuitive (also self deceptive), Pluto adventurous (despotic).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The above characteristics will be more expressed if aspects are close and formed in the angles and in the 1st, 3rd or 9th.
  </p>
<p>
   15
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Money
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   1.Sun (general prosperity, important for the female), Moon (general prosperity important for the male), Jupiter (progress), and Venus (happiness) are the natural significators of money.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Planets in the 2nd (self earned money), 5th (speculation), 8th (loss but legacies, inheritance), 4th (landed estates), 11th (success, income from business) or their rulers denote gain or loss through these matters.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   When all these are well placed by sign and house, in mutual good aspect and not afflicted by the malefics the monetary condition is satisfactory.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Sun or Moon in good aspect to Jupiter, Venus and Saturn; Jupiter or Venus in good aspect to Saturn, Uranus and Neptune is good for wealth.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.When these bodies are in cardinal signs easy earning and fast spending, success through enterprise; loss if they are afflicted. If in fixed signs slow earning but much saving, success in established concerns, steady income; sudden loss if they are afflicted. If in mutable signs gain by service and gain from more than one source, fluctuating income, earning by the support of others; loss due to lack of wisdom if they are afflicted.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.If the progressed Sun, Moon, Venus and Jupiter form conjunction with or good aspects to the radical (birth) Asc., Mc. cusp of the 2nd house and Fortuna, then this period will be favourable and prosperous. It should be remembered that all these bodies should be well aspected at birth, otherwise we can't expect much during directions.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the progressed Sun and Mc. form good aspects to the radical rulers of 10, 2, 9 and the planets in 2, 6, 9, 10 and 11 the period is favourable for occupation and service.

  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Planets in good aspect denote success ard refined occupations, while bad aspects show laborious occupations, troubles and failures.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Marriage
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus (love and attraction towards the opposite sex), Moon (wife in the male's map), Sun (husband in the female's map), Mars (sex in female), the planet in the 7th and the ruler of the 7th (marriage, husband or wife) are the significators of marriage.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Less likelihood of marriage. When these significators of marriage are in barren signs (Aries, Gemini, Leo, Virgo and Capricorn), are afflicted by Saturn, Uranus and Neptune (which delay or deny), are in cadent houses and are weaker there is less likelihood of marriage.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Circumstances other than these do not deny marriage, they may delay it.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus in any aspect to Mars (in both the sexes) and Mars in any aspect to Sun (in the female's map) indicate the possibility of marriage.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the significators of marriage are in mutual good aspect and not afflicted by Saturn, Uranus or Neptune the possibility of marriage is indicated.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Harmony with the opposite sex. Venus, Moon and Sun are the natural significators of marriage. So the good aspects between Venus-Moon, Venus-Sun, Venus-Mars, Venus-Jupiter, Venus-Saturn, Venus-Uranus, Venus-Neptune, Moon-Sun, Moon-Jupiter, Moon-Saturn; Sun-Mars, Sun-Jupiter and Sun-Saturn denote harmony in love and married life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If these planets be in the 7th or 5th (love) or if they are the rulers of the Asc, 7th and 5th and in good aspect they add to the harmony in love and married life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Disharmony with the opposite sex. Venus, Moon and Sun when afflicted by the malefics create disharmony in love and married life.
  </p>
<p>

<p>
   When these planets are in the 7th or 5th; or when they are the rulers of the Asc, 7th and 5th and in affliction they add to the disharmony in love and married life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   More than one marriage. If Sun (for the female), Moon (for the male), Venus, the planet in the 7th and the ruler of the 7th be in dual or double bodied signs (Gemini, Sagittarius or Pisces) or if they be in aspect to the planets placed in dual signs, there is a likelihood of several marriages.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Time for marriage. When the progressed planets form good aspects to the significators of marriage or the 7th cusp in the birth map, marriage takes place.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   When the progressed Venus or Moon passes through the 5th or 7th house in the birth map, it denotes marriage.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   When the progressed benefic passes through the 7th or forms good aspects to the ruler of the 7th and/or the planets placed in the 7th house in the birth map, marriage is indicated.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   When the progressed Venus forms conjunction with or good aspect to the radical Asc, Sun or Moon, marriage is brought about.
  </p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
   Children
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moon (inclination for child in the male and power of fertility in the female), Jupiter and Venus (child birth), the planet ruling the 5th and in the 5th and the planet ruling the 11th and in the 11th (5th from the 7th) are the significators of child birth.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Signs. If these significators are in fruitful (watery) signs they favour many issues; if in barren signs few children; if in double bodied or dual signs twin birth is likely.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Planets. Venus, Jupiter or Moon in 5th or 11th favours the birth of a child; Sun, Mars, Saturn, Uranus and Pluto are obstructive.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Aspects. Good aspects between Moon-Venus, Moon-Mars, Moon-Jupiter and Jupiter-Mars favour the birth of a child.
  </p>
<p>
   Bad aspects between Moon-Mars, Moon-Saturn and Sun-Mars in the female's map denote troubles in the uterus or difficulty in conception.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Affliction between Jupiter-Mars endangers the life of a child.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the significators of child birth are in congenial signs, well placed by house, in mutual good aspect and not afflicted by Mars, Saturn or Uranus the birth of a child is promised.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   For the birth of a child it is desirable to consider the birth charts of both husband and wife.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Travels
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moon (changes), Mercury (inclination for travel and the natural ruler of the 3rd house), Jupiter (the natural ruler of the 9th house), the planet ruling the 3rd and in the 3rd (short journey) and the planet ruling the 9th and in the 9th (long journey or voyage) are the significators of travel.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Signs. If these significators are in cardinal or mutable or watery signs there is every possibility of many changes, travels or voyages.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Houses. If they are in angles or cadent houses travels are likely.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Aspects. If these significators are well aspected travels are fruitful and beneficial. If afflicted by the malefics troubles arise on account of travels. If Moon and Mercury are well aspected by Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune they denote many travels.
