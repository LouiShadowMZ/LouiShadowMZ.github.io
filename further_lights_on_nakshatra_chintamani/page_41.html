   7th cusp (Libra 5° 22'): In this horoscope Aries 5° 22' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 7th cusp is Sun. It is in the star Ketu and in the sub Mercury. Sun owns 6, it is in conjunction with the owner of 1 and 8 Mars in Leo. Its star lord Ketu being in Scorpio represents Mars and it is also aspected by Mars owning 1 and 8 in Leo. Its sub lord Mercury is in 6 in conjunction with the owner of 10 (Jupiter) in Virgo. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 7 is strongly connected with 1 (absence of family life), 6 (absence of married life), 8 (disappointment), 10 (absence of permanent relationship) and also the barren sign. Hence the separation in married life.

The native and his wife could stay together till the periods of Jupiter and Saturn (both being in the sub Venus owning 2 and 7). Then followed the period of Mercury from 9-7-1959. It is in the star and the sub Moon which is aspected by the owner of 12 (Saturn). So it is connected with 12 (separation). Hence during the period of Mercury, Mercury and Rahu (the sub lord of the 11th cusp) the native's wife quitted her husband's house (13-11-1960 to 23-3-1961). During the period of Mercury, Rahu and Rahu (6-1-1969 to 24-5-1969) in February 1969 the native obtained the decree of the High Court regarding the annulment of marriage.
