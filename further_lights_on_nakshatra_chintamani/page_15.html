   8th cusp (Aries 24° 24'): The sub lord of the 8th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Moon. Mercury owns 1 and 12, it is in conjunction with Mars owning 8 in 8 and aspected by Saturn, it is in the violent sign Aries. So it becomes afflicted and malefic.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The star lord Sun is in association with the owner of the badhaka house 7 (Jupiter) in the violent sign Taurus, in 8. So it becomes malefic.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub lord Moon is in the violent sign Leo.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus the cuspal sub lord of 8 is the strong significator of 8 and connected with the badhaka house, 1, 8, 12; malefics Mars and Saturn; and violent signs. Hence it denotes a sudden unnatural death. As it is in conjunction with Mars, the native may be wounded.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   12th cusp (Virgo 2° 24'): The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Jupiter. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Rahu. Jupiter and Sun as discussed above have become malefic. Rahu is in the violent sign Sagittarius and as the representative of Jupiter it also becomes malefic.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus the cuspal sub lord of 12 is the strong significator of 8 and connected with the malefic, the badhaka house; also the violent sign. So it denotes a sudden unnatural death.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Venus with balance of 2Y 10M 24D. In cases of unnatural and sudden death the joint period of the cuspal sub lords of 8 and 12 (if they be the significators of 8 and 12) may be observed.
  </p>
<p>
   In this case during the joint period of Jupiter (the cuspal sub lord of 12), Saturn (the significator of 8, being aspected by the owner of 8 Mars) and Mercury (the cuspal sub lord of 8), the native was shot dead on 22-11-1963.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 22-11-1963 Sun Scorpio 6° 13', Jupiter Pisces 16° 36' and Mercury Scorpio 16° 7' were in the star Saturn the sub period ruler. Saturn Capricorn 24° 4' was in its own sign.

   Political Career :
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   ASC (Virgo 27° 5'): The sub lord of the Asc. is Jupiter. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Rahu. The star lord Sun owns 11, it is in association with the owner of 9 (Venus) and Jupiter. The sub lord Rahu is in Sagittarius. Thus the Asc. sub lord is connected with 9, 11; Sagittarius; Sun, Jupiter and Rahu. Hence the native was inclined to public life and politics.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   10th cusp (Cancer 0° 24'): The sub lord of the 10th cusp is Moon. It is in the star Venus and in the sub Mercury. Moon in 11 owns 10, it is in Leo. The star lord Venus owns 9, it is in association with Sun owning 11 and Jupiter. The sub lord Mercury owns 1, it is in conjunction with Mars, it is aspected by Saturn which is in the 10th. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 10 is connected with 1, 9, 10, 11; Leo; Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Hence the native plunged into politics.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Leo 3° 24'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Sun. It is in the star Moon and in the sub Jupiter. All these planets are discussed above. So the native was successful in achieving the highest position of the president in U. S. A. He was the late John Kennedy.
