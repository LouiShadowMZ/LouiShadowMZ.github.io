   the owner of 5 (Moon), also the 11th. So a choice marriage is indicated.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The native got married during the joint period of Jupiter, Jupiter and Moon in December 1942. The native and his wife were separated during the joint period of Jupiter and Saturn in 1945-46. Even to-day they do not stay together.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.(a) So we may now discuss the effects of the joint rulers of the 7th cusp. The sign lord Venus is in the star Jupiter and in the sub Saturn. All of them occupy barren signs viz., Gemini, Leo and Virgo respectively. Its star lord Jupiter owns 12 (separation). Its sub lord Saturn owns 10 (absence of married life); it is on the 6th cusp in conjunction with the malefic Rahu. Thus the owner of 7 Venus is the significator of 12 and connected with 6, 10; barren signs and malefics. Hence Venus is not congenial for conjugal life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) Rahu (the star lord of the 7th cusp) is in the star Mars and in the sub Saturn. Its star lord Mars owns 1, 8 (disappointment); it is in its fall sign and aspects the 7th, so it disturbs the married life. Its sub lord Saturn owns 10. Rahu and Saturn are in the 6th in the barren sign Virgo. Thus Rahu is the significator of 1, 8 and connected with 6, 10, barren sign and malefics. So it is not congenial for conjugal life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (c) Saturn (the cuspal sub lord of 7) is in the star Sun and in the sub Jupiter. All of them are in barren signs viz., Virgo and Leo respectively. Saturn owns 10, occupies the 6th cusp in conjunction with Rahu. Its star lord Sun and the sub lord Jupiter are in conjunction. Its sub lord Jupiter owns 12. Thus Saturn is connected with 6, 10, 12, malefics and barren signs. So it is not congenial for conjugal life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Capricorn 29° 43'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Saturn. So it is not congenial for conjugal life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2nd cusp (Taurus 12° 2'): The sub lord of the 2nd cusp is Rahu. So it is not congenial for conjugal life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub lords of the joint rulers of the 7th cusp are the owners of 10 and 12 respectively. So also the sub lords of the cuspal sub lords of 7, 11 and 2 are the owners of 12 and 10 respectively. Hence they denote absence of married life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Periods: The native was born during the period of Mars with balance of 1Y. 9M. 6D.. Then followed the periods of Rahu (1923), Jupiter (1941), Saturn (1957) and Mercury (1976). Jupiter's sub lord Rahu being in Virgo becomes the owner of 6 (absence of married life). Saturn is in the sub Jupiter owning 12 (separation). Mercury is also in the sub Jupiter owning 12. Hence there is no possibility of conjugal life.
  </p>

<p>
   Despite their living separate, they maintain cordial relations with each other. They often meet together and they attend social functions at each other's relatives. Both of them hold very high positions of first cadre in the government institutions.
