   Hints: If the sub lord of the 4th cusp is the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 4 (building, land), 11 (gain) or 12 (investment); or connected with 4, 11 or 12, also with Mars (building) or Saturn (land, mines, estates) the native will have his own building during the joint period of the significators of 4, 11 and 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4th cusp (Sagittarius 2° 41'): In this horoscope Virgo 2° 39' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 4th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Jupiter and in the sub Mars. Venus is in Cancer the natural sign of the 4th house, it is in association with the owner of 12 (Sun) and Saturn. The star lord Jupiter owns 4 and aspects the 4th, the owner of 11 (Moon) and Mars. The sub lord Mars is in conjunction with the owner of 11 (Moon). Thus the cuspal sub lord of 4 is the significator of 4, 11 and connected with 4, 11, 12; also Mars and Saturn. Hence it promises the native his own building.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Significators of 4,11,12:
  </p>
<p>
   House	Planet in occupant's star	Occupant	Planet in owner's star	Owner
  </p>
<p>
   4	None	None	V	J

<p>
   12	S,R,Sa.	Me.	None	S
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus, Saturn, Sun and Rahu are the strong significators. Moon and Jupiter are in the star of the significator Rahu, so they may be considered.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Rahu with balance of 17Y. 8M. 23D.. During the joint period of Saturn, Sun and Jupiter, the native purchased land on 3-10-1962.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Saturn, Moon and Jupiter, in October 1963 the native occupied the building constructed by him.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 3-10-1962 Sun Virgo 16° 34' and Jupiter Aquarius 10° 41' were in the sub Saturn the period ruler. Moon in Scorpio was passing through the star Jupiter and Saturn.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Eye-operation :
  </p>
<p>
   12th cusp (Leo 3° 41'): The 12th house denotes defect. The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Moon (vision). It is in conjunction with Mars owning 8 (operation). So it denotes operation for getting vision.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Rahu with balance of 17Y. 8M. 23D.. Thereafter he will have to run the periods of Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury respectively. Mercury is connected with defective vision. Because it is in the star Venus (vision) owning 2 (vision), it is in the sub Saturn (obstruction) owning 6 (disease); the star Venus and the sub Saturn both are in association with Sun (vision) owning 12 (defect). The combined effect of all these planets causes cataract in the eye.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The 12th house denotes hospitalisation. The 8th house and Mars signify operations. So during the joint period of the significator of disease and the cuspal sub lords of 8 and 12 connected with Mars, the native undergoes operations.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In this case during the joint period of Mercury, Moon (the cuspal sub lord of 12) and Venus (the star lord of the period ruler, also the cuspal sub lord of 8 connected with Mars as its sub lord) the right eye of the native was operated for cataract on 28-7-1979.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 28-7-1979 Sun Cancer 11° was in the sub Moon the sub period ruler. Moon Leo 26° was in the star Venus the inter period ruler. Venus Cancer 3° was in the sign owned by Moon.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Loss of Parents in Teenage :
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   1.The native was born during the period of Rahu with balance of 17Y. 8M. 23D. We may now examine the effects of Rahu in respect of the longevity of his parents.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   9th cusp (Taurus 1° 41'): The 9th cusp represents the Asc. for the native's father. As counted from the 9th cusp Rahu is in the 7th. It is in the star Mercury and in the sub Jupiter. The star lord Mercury owns the maraka house 2. The sub lord Jupiter owns 8. Rahu in Scorpio as a representative of Mars owns 7 and 12. Rahu is the cuspal sub lord of 7 (Scorpio 1° 41'). Thus Rahu is the strong maraka significator and connected with 8. Hence its period will prove fatal to the native's father.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4th cusp (Sagittarius 2° 41'): The 4th cusp represents the Asc. for the native's mother. As counted from the 4th cusp Rahu is in the 12th. It is in the star Mercury and in the sub Jupiter. The star lord Mercury owns the badhaka-maraka house 7. The sub lord Jupiter is in the badhaka house 7. Rahu is the cuspal sub lord of 12 (Scorpio 1° 41'). Thus Rahu is the badhaka-maraka significator. Hence its period will prove fatal to the native's mother.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.We may now examine the 8th cusps of the parents.
  </p>
<p>
   Father's 8th cusp (Sagittarius 2° 41'): The sub lord of the father's 8th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Jupiter and in the sub Mars. Jupiter owns 8, Mars owns 7 and 12. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 8 is the strong significator of 8 and connected with the maraka houses. Hence the native's father will suddenly pass away in short sickness.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mother's 8th cusp (Cancer 3° 41'): The sub lord of the mother's 8th cusp is Saturn. It is in the star Mercury and in the sub Rahu. Saturn is in Cancer in the 8th, it denotes long sickness and disease. Mercury owns the badhaka-maraka house 7. Rahu is in the maraka house 12. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 8 is both badhaka and maraka. Hence the native's mother will die after suffering long sickness.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.Hints: If the cuspal sub lords of 1, 8 and 12 be the badhaka-maraka significators, death occurs during their joint periods.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The native's father died on 16-8-1930 during the joint period of Rahu (the cuspal sub lord of the maraka house 7), Venus (the cuspal sub lord of 8 and 12) and Moon (the maraka significator of the father).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The native's mother died on 30-1-1932 during the joint period of Rahu (the cuspal sub lord of 12), Venus (the cuspal sub lord of the badhaka house and Asc.) and Saturn (the cuspal sub lord of 8 of the mother.)
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4.Transits: On 16-8-1930 Moon Aries 15° was in the star Venus the sub period ruler. Venus Virgo 14' was in the star Moon the inter period ruler. Rahu Aries 4° 7' was in the sub Moon.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   On 30-1-1932 Sun Capricorn 16° was in the sub Saturn the inter period ruler. Moon Libra 17° was in the star Rahu the period ruler. Venus Aquarius 19° 57' was in the star Rahu. Rahu Pisces 5° 55' was in the star Saturn,
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Profession and Finance:
  </p>
<p>
   1 (a) 10th cusp(Gemini 2° 41'): The sub lord of the 10th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Jupiter and in the sub Mars. Venus is in the 10th(vocation), it owns 2(finance) and 9 (learning). Its star lord Jupiter(learning) is in the 10th in Gemini(education). Its sub lord Mars owns 3(educational matters) and occupies 2 in the intellectual sign Libra, it is in conjunction with the owner of 11 (gain) Moon. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 10 denotes educational activities and financial gain thereby.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) 2nd cusp (Libra 1° 41'): The sub lord of the 2nd cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Venus and in the sub Saturn. Mercury owns 10. Its star lord Venus owns 2 and occupies 10. Its sub lord Saturn owns 6 and occupies 11. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 2 is the significator of 2, 10 and connected with 6, 10 and 11. Hence the native will have his own independent earning.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2 (a) Joint Period: The native was born during the period of Rahu with balance of 17Y. 8M. 23D.. He obtained his first degree in May 1940 during the joint period of Jupiter, Saturn and Rahu. These joint period rulers are also the significators of 10. So he got his first employment in service on 1-6-1940 during their joint period.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The period ruler Jupiter is in the sub Mercury owning 10 (the cuspal sub lord of 2). The sub period ruler Saturn(the owner of 6 and the cuspal sub lord of 11) and the inter period ruler Rahu both are in the star Mercury.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 1-6-1940 Sun Taurus 17° 30' and Jupiter Aries 10° 41' were in the sub Saturn the sub period ruler. Rahu Virgo 24° 34' was in its own sub the inter period ruler. Saturn Aries 16° was in the star Venus the significator of 10. Moon Pisces 22° was in the star Mercury the significator of 10.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) Joint Period: During the joint period of Jupiter, Venus (the cuspal sub lord of 10) and Ketu the significator of 2 the native was appointed as a professor in a college on 11-11-1946. Ketu is in the star Mars and in the sub Jupiter; the star lord Mars owns 3(education) and occupies 2 (finance), the sub lord Jupiter (college) is in the 10th (vocation).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 11-11-1946 Sun Libra 25° was in the star Jupiter the period ruler. Moon Taurus 20° 21', Jupiter Libra 17° 7' and Ketu Scorpio 19° 50' were in the sub Venus the sub period ruler.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (c) During the joint period of Saturn, Saturn and Ketu the native officiated as the Principal in the college from 11-4-1953 upto 30-4-1954.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Saturn is the cuspal sub lord of 11. It is in the star Mercury and in the sub Rahu. Its star lord Mercury owns 10 (position), 1(change in service being 12th from 2) and occupies 12(change of environment). Its sub lord Rahu occupies 3 (change of environment). Saturn owns 6 (service) and 5(change in service being 12th from 6), so the change in service becomes the source of the forthcoming event (i.e. change in position),
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Ketu is in the star Mars and in the sub Jupiter. Ketu occupies 9(change in position being 12th from 10). The star lord Mars owns 3(change) and occupies 2(finance). The sub lord Jupiter owns 4(the same location) and 7(contact with others) and occupies 10(position). Hence it effected a better change at the same place.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (d) During the joint period of Saturn, Saturn and Mars he reverted to his original post of the professor on 1-5-1954. Mars is in its own star and in the sub Sun. As the sub lord Sun owns 12 (loss), the native was now on his permanent post.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (e) During the joint period of Saturn (owning 6), Moon (owning 11) and Mercury (owning 10), the native was promoted to the post of the vice-principal of the college with effect from 1-5-1964.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moon is in the star and sub Rahu in 3. Its effect is to be construed in concurrence with that of the period ruler. So it effected a change for the better as the owner of 11. It is also the cuspal sublord of 12 (change).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mercury (the owner of 10 and the cuspal sub lord of 2) is the significator of 2, 10 and connected with 6, 10 and 11 as discussed earlier. So it gave him a permanent better position with monetary gain.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In nutshell the period ruler Saturn is the cuspal sub lord of 11 (fulfilment of desire), the sub period ruler Moon is the cuspal sub lord of 12 (change of environment) and the inter period ruler Mercury is the cuspal sub lord of 2 (finance).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 1-5-1964 Sun Aries 17° was in the sub Moon the sub period ruler. Mercury Aries 11° was in the sub Saturn the period ruler. Saturn Aquarius 10°12' was in its own sign.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Retirement from Service :
  </p>
<p>
   Hints: The native generally retires from service during the joint period of the significators (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 1, 5, 9 (being 12th from 2, 6 and 10) and 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The native retired from service on 1-9-1978 during the joint period of Mercury (owning 1), Moon (cuspal sub lord of 12-change of environments) and Rahu (cuspal sub lord of 3-change of environments) These planets are the significators of 1, 5, 9 and 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The retiring age in service is normally 58. In this case the period of Mercury started from 12-4-1971. Mercury is in the star Venus and in the sub Saturn. The star lord Venus owns 9. The sub lord Saturn owns 5. Thus Mercury is the significator of 9 (absence of position being 12th from 10) and connected with 5 (absence of service being 12th from 6). Hence retirement from service.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moon is in the star and sub Rahu in 3 (change of environments), It is the significator of 3 and also the cuspal sub lord of 12. Moon's influence is to be interpreted in concurrence with that of the period ruler Mercury. So there will be a change of environments in service i.e. retirement from service.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu is in the star Mercury owning 1 and occupying 12. So it is the significator of 1 and 12; also the cuspal sub lord of 3. Hence retirement from service.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 1-9-1978 Moon was in its own sign Cancer. Mercury Cancer 27°16' was in its own star the period ruler. Rahu Virgo 4°14' was in the star Sun, the significator of 1 and 12.
