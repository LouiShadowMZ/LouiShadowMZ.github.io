   7th cusp (Scorpio 13°24'): In this horoscope Taurus 13°24' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 7th cusp is Rahu. It is in the star Moon and in the sub Mars. Rahu in Virgo is in conjunction with the owner of 10 (Saturn) and the owner of 8 (Jupiter) in the 6th. The star lord Moon occupies 12 and on the Asc. It is aspected by the owner of 12 (Mars) and the owner of 8 (Jupiter). The sub lord Mars owns 12 and is aspected by the owner of 10 (Saturn). Thus the cuspal sub lord of 7 is the significator of 1, 12 and connected with 6, 10 and 12. Hence the separation in married life.

   The house 2 denotes the family life and the sub lord of the 2nd cusp Jupiter is the strong significator of 1,6,10 and 12. So during the joint period of Jupiter, its star lord and its sub lord the native might get separated from her husband.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In fact during the joint period of Jupiter, Saturn and Moon (7-2-1961 to 23-4-1961) the native quitted her husband's house. Thereafter she went abroad and she still stays there in the foreign land.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   12th cusp (Aries 7°4'): The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Rahu. It is in the star Moon and in the sub Mars. The star lord Moon owns 3 and occupies 12. The sub lord Mars owns 12. So Rahu is the significator of 3,12 and connected with 12. Hence it promises foreign journey and stay abroad.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Further the period ruler Jupiter owns 11. It is in the star Moon and and in the sub Saturn owning 9. So Jupiter is the significator of 3,12 and connected with 9. Hence the foreign journey to the native (during the joint period of Jupiter and Saturn).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Jupiter, Moon (its star lord) and Rahu (the sub lord of 1, 6, 7, 11 and 12 cusps) the native's husband obtained the decree of the High Court regarding the annulment of marriage in February 1969.
