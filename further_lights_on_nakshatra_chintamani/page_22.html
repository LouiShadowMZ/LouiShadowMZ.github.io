   Example Nativities - 18.Caesarean
  </h1>
<p>
   Hints: If the sub lord of the 5th cusp (female) and the 11th cusp (male) is the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 2 (increase in family), 5 (conception, child) or 11 (5th from 7); or connected with 2, 5 or 11 child birth is promised.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If it is the significator of 1, 4 or 10 (being 12th from 2, 5 and 11) child birth is not promised.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   5th cusp (Virgo 6° 12'): In this horoscope Taurus 17°44′ is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 5th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Mars and in the sub Saturn.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mercury owns 2, 5 and occupies 5; it aspects the 11th. So it is connected with 2, 5 and 11. Hence child birth is promised.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mercury is associated with Ketu and aspected by Saturn. Hence delay in child birth.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The star lord Mars owns the maraka houses 7, 12 and occupies 6; it aspects the 12th and Asc. The sub lord Saturn occupies 8; it aspects the 2nd and 5th, also Ketu and Mercury in 5. So this cuspal sub lord is connected with Mars (operation), Saturn (obstruction), Ketu (unnatural), the houses 1 (native), 6 (sickness), 8 (danger, operation), 12 (hospitalisation); 2, 5 (child birth). Hence the possibility of Caesarean
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Pisces 6°12′): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Mercury. Hence the position as above.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8th cusp (Sagittarius 12°12′): It denotes operation. So its sub lord may be considered. Its sublord is Mercury. Hence the possibility of caesarean.

<p>
   Jupiter, Moon, Sun, Saturn and Venus are the strong significators. Rahu represents the significator Jupiter, so Rahu may be given preference. Further Sun and Mercury are in the sub Saturn the significator. Moon and Venus are in the sub Jupiter the significator. Mars is in the sub Venus the significator. Rahu is in the sub Moon the significator. Hence Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu and Mercury may be considered as important significators of child birth.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Ketu with balance of 2Y. 7M. 2D. Thereafter she will run the periods of Venus, Sun and Moon respectively. In this case child birth is late. So during the joint period of Moon, Jupiter and Venus, the native delivered a female child on 28-2-1964. The delivery was effected by caesarean. The inter period ruler Venus is in association with Mars.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Moon, Mercury (the sub lord of the 5th and 11th cusps) and Rahu the native gave birth to another female child on 18-2-1967. The sub period ruler Mercury is in the star Mars and the birth was by caesarean.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Mars, Rahu and Rahu a premature delivery of a still born child was caused by caesarean on 18-10-1970. Thereafter the native passed through critical moments of life, but she survived.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The period ruler Mars owns 12, it is in the star Jupiter owning 8 and in the sub Venus owning 6. So it denotes a critical period for life. But the sub and inter period ruler Rahu is in the star Saturn in 8 (favourable for longevity) and in the sub Moon owning 3 (longevity). Hence the native recovered from dangerous sickness.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 28-2-1964 Sun Aquarius 16° was in the sub Venus the inter period ruler. Moon Leo 27°37′ was in its own sub the period ruler. Jupiter Pisces 26°45′ was in its own sub, the sub period ruler. Venus Pisces 27°32′ was in the sub Jupiter.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   On 18-2-1967 Sun Aquarius 6° was in the sub Moon the period ruler. Moon Taurus 15° was in its own star.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   On 18-10-1970 Sun Libra 1°21' was in the star Mars the period ruler. Rahu Aquarius 6°34′ was in the star Mars.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The native is a Doctor.
