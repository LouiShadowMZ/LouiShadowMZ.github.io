   Hints: Consider the houses 8 and 12 for accidents. Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu cause accidents. The houses 1 (health), 5 (absence of sickness being 12th to 6) and 11 (absence of hospitalisation being 12th to 12) denote safety from any danger.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.
  </p>
<p>
   If the sub lord of the Asc., 8th or 12th cusp; or if the joint rulers of the Asc., 8th or 12th cusp be the significators (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 8 or 12 the native is likely to meet with an accident.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Aries, Gemini, Libra, Sagittarius and Capricorn are conducive to accidents.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.
  </p>
<p>
   If the sub lord of the Asc., 8th or 12th cusp be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 8, 12 or badhaka house and connected with malefics, cardinal or violent signs viz., Aries, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Sagittarius or Capricorn the native meets with a sudden unnatural death.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4.
  </p>
<p>
   Accidents and unnatural deaths are caused during the joint period of the significators of 8 and 12 or of the cuspal joint rulers of 8 and 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   5.
  </p>
<p>
   If the sub lord of the 8th or 12th cusp be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 1, 5 or 11 the native surpasses the danger, during the joint period of the significators of 1, 5 and 11.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8th cusp (Cancer 16° 41'): In this horoscope Sagittarius 13° 41' is on the Asc. It is conducive to accidents.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub lord of the 8th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Mars and in the sub Mercury. The star lord Mars owns the maraka house 12 and occupies the badhaka house 7; it is in Gemini (conducive to accidents) in association with Ketu; it is retrograde; it aspects the Asc. (native). The sub lord Mercury owns the badhaka house 7 and occupies the maraka house
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 8 is the significator of 12, the badhaka-maraka houses and connected with them, also malefics. The star Mars and the sub Mercury both occupy air signs. Hence an unnatural death by an air accident.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Significators of 8 and 12:
  </p>
<p>
   House 8:
  </p>
<p>
   Planet in occupant's star: None
  </p>
<p>
   Occupant: None
  </p>
<p>
   Planet in owner's star: None
  </p>
<p>
   Owner: M (Moon)
  </p>
<p>
   House 12:
  </p>
<p>
   Occupant: Sa. (Saturn), R (Rahu)
  </p>
<p>
   Planet in occupant's star: None (for Sa), S, J, K (for R)
  </p>
<p>
   Planet in owner's star: M, Me.
  </p>
<p>
   Owner: Ma. (Mars)
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus Moon, Saturn, Sun, Jupiter, Ketu and Mercury are the significators.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The 8th cusp is jointy ruled by Moon, Mercury and Mercury. They are the significators of 8 and 12. Hence they should be considered.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint Period: The native was born during the period of Mars with balance of 5Y. 11M. 28D. In this horoscope the sub lord of the Asc. Venus is the strong significator of 1 and it denotes a long life. So the joint period of significators (of 8 and 12) which starts after the age of 66 should be taken into account. Hence the joint period of Mercury and Moon which commences from 17-3-1965 should be watched carefully.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   At the time of war the native's air-plane was crashed by the enemy's plane on 19-9-1965 during the joint period of Mercury, Moon, Jupiter and Ketu; and his body was torn to pieces.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The accident proved fatal, because the sub lords of these joint period rulers are connected with the badhaka-maraka houses. Mercury and Ketu are in the sub Mercury the badhaka owner.Jupiter's sub is in conjunction with Mercury. Moon's sub Rahu is in the 12th and aspected by Mars owning 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 19-9-1965 Sun Virgo 2° 40' was in the sub Jupiter (the inter period ruler). Moon Gemini 14° was in the sub Mercury (the period ruler). Mercury Leo 26° was in the sub Ketu (the sookshma period ruler). Jupiter Gemini 6° 35' was in the sub Moon (the sub period ruler).
