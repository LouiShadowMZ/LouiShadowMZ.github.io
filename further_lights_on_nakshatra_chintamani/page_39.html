   Hints. If the sub lord of the 7th cusp be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 1, 6 or 10 (being 12th from 2, 7 and 11); or connected with 1, 6 or 10 it does not promise marriage or it denotes absence of married life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If it be the significator of or connected with 2, 7 or 11 and 1, 6 or 10 the marriage takes place during the joint period of the significators of 2, 7 and 11 and it does not take place during the joint period of the significators of 1, 6 and 10.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the native be married already, then during the joint period of the significators of 1, 6 and 10 there is no possibility of conjugal life or else there is some sort of estrangement or separation in married life; it also denotes divorce.

   7th cusp (Libra 29° 3'): In this horoscope Aries 29° 3' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 7th cusp is Sun. It is in the star Ketu and in the sub Mercury. Sun aspects the 7th and it is aspected by the owner of 11 (Saturn). The star lord Ketu is in the 7th. The sub lord Mercury is in association with the owner of 7 and 2 Venus. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 7 is the significator of 7 and connected with 2, 7 and 11. Hence it promises marriage to the native.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The cuspal sub lord of 7 Sun is aspected by Saturn and the 7th cusp is aspected by the owner of 8 Mars. So a late marriage is indicated. In such cases the marriage takes place in between the age of 28 and 30 or so.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Significators: Venus; Sun, Moon, Jupiter; and Mars are the significators of 2, 7 and 11. Ketu being in Scorpio represents Mars, hence it should be considered as the significator.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Jupiter with balance of 1Y. 11M. 23D.. The native completes his 28th year when the joint period of Mercury and Moon ends (20-5-1975 to 20-11-1976). Mercury is connected with Venus and Jupiter the significators of marriage. So it becomes the significator of marriage. Further, it should be remembered that none can avoid the serial order of the Dasha system. Hence it may be inferred that the native may get married during the joint period of Mercury and Moon. Giving preference to Ketu, the native got married on 6-6-1976 during the joint period of Mercury, Moon and Ketu.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

Its sub lord Mercury owns 6 and occupies 12, it is in conjunction with the owner of 1 and 8 Mars. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 7 is connected with 6, 10 (negation of married life), 8 (disappointment), 12 (separation) and as its (Sun's) sub lord is the owner of 6 there is disappointment in married life, hence it indicates separation or divorce.

   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Jupiter with balance of 1Y. 11M. 23D..
  </p>

   As the cuspal sub lord of 7 was the significator of 7, the native got married on 6-6-1976 during the joint period of the marriage-significators Mercury, Moon and Ketu.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thereafter, during the joint period of Mercury (owner 6), Mars (owner 1), Jupiter (owner 12) and Ketu the wife of the native went to her parents' house on 25-1-1977. She then did not return to her husband's house. So during the joint period of Mercury, Rahu, Venus and Mars the native took divorce on 22-7-1979 according to the customs and conventions of the caste. It may be noted that the sub lords of all these significators are connected with 1, 6 and 12. Hence the divorce.
