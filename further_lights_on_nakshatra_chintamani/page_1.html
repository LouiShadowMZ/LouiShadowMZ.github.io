   Preface
  </h1>
<p>
   My first book 'Nakshatra Chintamani' was published in 1975. It was much hailed by readers. Encouraged, another publication 'Horoscopes and Diseases' was brought out during December 1977. Both these books deal with horoscopes according to the sub constellation theory of prediction. They were widely circulated both in India and Abroad. Letters of appreciation were received, so relevant extracts from the letters of a few Astrologers are published in this book for information to the reader.

<p>
   In view of the appreciative attitude shown by the students of Astrology, my friend Shri Shambhuprasad M. Patel encouraged me to write a third book with further lights on 'Nakshatra Chintamani' and he, on behalf of the Board of Trustees of Shri Vivek Education Trust, undertook the publication of this book. I am therefore much indebted to the Board of Trustees and my friend Shri Patel.

   The principles of the sub theory are at length explained in 'Nakshatra Chintamani'. Here in this book I have summarised them lucidly in a tabular form to refresh the memory of the reader. Horoscopes of persons in different walks of life and cases known to me have been discussed in simple and lucid language. Delineations are consistent, logical, methodical and precise.

   There are four groups in the book. The 1st group contains 49 horoscopes on subjects viz. infant mortality, short life, long life, unnatural or violent death, incurable diseases, operations, education, foreign travels, inter-caste marriages, love-affairs, divorces, separation in married life, child-birth, sterility, unmarried persons, landed properties, owning of vehicles, different vocations etc; six horary maps in the 2nd group, four horoscopes concerning the effects of transitting planets are in the 3rd group. In the fourth and the last group the salient features of the western system of Astrology are narrated in brief and self-contained charts for analysis of the birth-map are prepared. These charts will enable a beginner in Astrology to form judgment of the birth-map with great ease. They may be applied even to Nirayana birth horoscopes.

</p>
<p>
   In my humble view, there are few publications of this type. I am therefore sure that my books will be of great help to the reader who is conversant with the basic principles of Hindu Astrology.
