   Consider the 11th and 2nd cusps also.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   7th cusp (Aquarius 28° 58'): In this horoscope Leo 28° 58' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 7th cusp is Sun. It is in the star Moon and in the sub Mars. Sun owns 1 and occupies the barren sign Capricorn, it is aspected by the owner of 6 Saturn the obstructor. The star lord Moon owns 12 and occupies 6. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 7 is the significator of 6, 12 and connected with 1; barren sign and Saturn.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Gemini 29° 58'). The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Moon. It is in the star Rahu and in the sub Sun. Sun and Moon are discussed above. The star lord Rahu is aspected by Saturn owning 6. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 11 is connected with 1, 6, 12; Rahu, Saturn and the barren sign.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2nd cusp (Virgo 27° 58'). The sub lord of the 2nd cusp is Saturn. It is in the star Mercury and in the sub Moon. Saturn owns 6, it is in conjunction with Ketu. The star lord Mercury occupies the barren sign, it is in conjunction with the owner of 1 (Sun) and aspected by the owner of 6 Saturn. The sub lord Moon owns 12 and occupies 6. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 2 is connected with 1, 6, 12; Saturn, Ketu and the barren sign.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   It will be observed that the cuspal sub lords of 7, 11 and 2 are connected with 1, 6, 12; the barren sign; also Saturn, Rahu or Ketu. These indications are not congenial for marriage. Hence the native is unmarried at the age of 53.
