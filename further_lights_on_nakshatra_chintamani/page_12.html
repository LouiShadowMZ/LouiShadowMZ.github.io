   ASC (Leo 3° 50'): The sub lord of the Asc. is Moon. It is in the star Venus and in the sub Mercury. Moon owns 12, it is aspected by the owner of the badhaka house 9 (Mars) and the owner of the maraka house 7 (Saturn), so it becomes afflicted and malefic. The star lord Venus and the sub lord Mercury owning the maraka house 2 are in conjunction; they both are aspected by the owner of 8 (JupiterR.), so they become malefic. Thus the Asc. sub lord becomes both badhaka and maraka; and denotes a short life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The Asc sub lord (Moon), its star (Venus) and its sub (Mercury) are in the violent signs e.g. Aries and Scorpio respectively. The Asc. sub lord is connected with malefics e.g. Mars and Saturn; also with 8, 12 and the badhaka house. So the native will meet with a sudden unnatural death.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Water signs are on the cusps of the 4th (end of life), 8th (death) and 12th (calamity-salvation). Moon owning 12 is aspected by Mars owning 4. The star Venus and the sub Mercury are in Scorpio; they are aspected by Jupiter owning 8. Thus the Asc. sub lord, its star lord and sub lord are connected with water signs and the owners of these water signs. So They denote danger by water.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8th cusp (Pisces 0° 54'): The sub lord of the 8th cusp is Mars. It is in its own star and in the sub Sun. The star lord Mars owns the badhaka house 9, it is in conjunction with the owner of the maraka house 7 (Saturn) and aspected by the owner of 12 (Moon), so it becomes afflicted and malefic. The sub lord Sun owns the Asc. but aspected by Saturn, so it also becomes malefic. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 8 becomes both badhaka and maraka, it is connected with malefics e.g. Mars and Saturn. The cuspal sub lord, its star Mars and its sub Sun are in the signs denoting accidents e.g. Libra and Sagittarius. So an unnatural death is indicated due to an accident.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   12th cusp (Cancer 4° 54'): The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Saturn. It is in the star Rahu and in the sub Mercury. Saturn owns the maraka house 7, it is in conjunction with the owner of the badhaka house 9 (Mars), and aspected by the owner of 12 (Moon), so it becomes afflicted and malefic. The star lord Rahu is aspected by Mars and Jupiter, so it is connected with the badhaka house 9 and 8; and it becomes malefic. The sub lord Mercury owns the maraka house 2 and aspected by the owner of 8 (Jupiter), so it becomes malefic. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 12 becomes both badhaka and maraka, it is connected with malefics e.g. Mars, Saturn and Rahu. The cuspal sub lord, its star and sub are in the signs denoting accidents e.g. Libra, Capricorn and Scorpio respectively. So an unnatural death is indicated due to an accident.

   Joint Period: The native was born during the period of Venus with balance of 1Y. 2M. 12D. Thereafter the native is to run the periods of Sun, Moon and Mars etc, respectively. Out of them Mars is the planet of accident, the strong significator of the badhaka house and the cuspal sub lord of 8. So during the joint period of Mars, Saturn and Saturn (the cuspal sub lord of 12) on 2-8-1973 the native went on a picnic with his fellow students on the river bank. All these students advised him not to bathe into the river, because the place was not safe for bathing. The native did not pay heed to their advice and jumped into the river and he was drowned.
