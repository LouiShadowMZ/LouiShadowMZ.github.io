   Sub Theory
  </h1>
<p>
   In the Nakshatra system, each Nakshatra or Constellation or Star (an area of 13° 20' or 800') is sub-divided into nine parts. This sub-division is called a 'Sub'. It is based on the formula as shown in the table on page 1
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The planet ruling the longitude or extent or area of the 'Sub' in any Nakshatra or Constellation or Star is called the Sub-Nakshatra lord or Sub-Constellation lord or Sub-Star lord or Sub-lord or simply Sub.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub-area of each planet in the star-area of any planet remains constant as stated above. As each Nakshatra or Constellation or Star contains nine Subs, 27 Nakshatras or Constellations or Stars have been sub-divided into 243 Subs in total across the zodiac.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The order of Subs in each Star is shown in the accompanying tables A, B, C and D on pages 3, 4, 5 and 6.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Each table shows the Star Lord and the Sub Lord for each degree of the Zodiac. The Star Lord is similar to the Dasha (period) ruler, while the Sub Lord corresponds to the Sub period [Bhukti] ruler.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In short, we may use the term 'Star' instead of 'Star lord' or 'Constellation lord' or 'Nakshatra lord;' and the term 'Sub' in place of 'Sub lord' or 'Sub-Star lord' or 'Sub-Constellation lord' or 'Sub-Nakshatra lord' throughout the book.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Tables A, B, C &amp; D explained:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The table A is meant for Aries, Leo and Sagittarius; the table B for Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn; the table C for Gemini, Libra and Aquarius and the table D for Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Example: In table A, in the Star area Ketu in Aries or Leo or Sagittarius, the Sub of Ketu begins from 0° 0' 0" and ends at 0° 46' 40". So the Sub of Venus starts at 0° 46' 40", add 2° 13' 20" (Sub area of Venus) and you get the starting position of Sun Sub at 3° 0' 00", add 0° 40' 0" (Sub area of Sun), then the Sub of Moon starts at 3° 40' 0" in Aries or Leo or Sagittarius. Repeat this procedure and the commencing position for all subs in each star in each sign will be obtained.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Significators:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   1.	A planet generally gives the results of the house which it occupies, owns and aspects; also of the house and the matter of which it is a Karaka (natural significator). So it is termed as the Significator of that house or matter.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.	In the horoscope the sign is on the cusp of each house. A planet always occupies the sign and its strength is determined according as it occupies its own sign, exalted sign or debilitated sign. So the occupant is stronger than the owner of the sign.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Similarly, the sign is the 1/12th part of the Zodiac, while the Constellation or Star is the 1/27th part of the Zodiac. So the Constellation or Star is stronger than the sign.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hence in the Nakshatra system a planet gives the results indicated by its star lord and it is called the significator of the houses signified by its star lord in the strict sense of the term.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.	he order of preference regarding the significators of each house is generally determined as under:
  </p>
<p>
   (a) A planet in the star of the occupant is stronger than the occupant.
  </p>
<p>
   (b) If there be no planet in the occupant's star, consider the occupant.
  </p>
<p>
   (c) If the house is vacant, consider the planet in the star of the owner of that house.
  </p>
<p>
   (d) If the house be vacant and if there be no planet in the star of the owner of that house, consider the owner of that house.
  </p>
<p>
   (e) A planet in conjunction or association with, or aspected by the strong significator gives the results of the house or houses denoted by that significator.
  </p>
<p>
   (f) A planet in the star of the planet aspecting the house e.g. suppose Saturn in the 5th aspects the 7th, 11th and 2nd. So the planet in the star of Saturn will give the results of the houses 2, 7, and 11.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu &amp; Ketu: If Rahu or Ketu represents any significator, consider Rahu or Ketu in place of that significator, because Rahu or Ketu is stronger than any planet.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu or Ketu gives the results of the significator in conjunction with or in aspect to it or of the owner of the (significator's) sign occupied by it.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Suppose Aries is on the 11th cusp, there is no planet in the 11th, then consider the other sign Scorpio owned by Mars. If there be Rahu or Ketu in Scorpio, it will give the results of the 11th and the planet in the star of Rahu or Ketu will become the strong significator to give the results of the 11th.Examine the position in respect of any other house in this way. Rahu-Ketu are not to be treated as retrograde planets, because their natural movement is in the opposite direction.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Strength of Planets:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Strength by House: A planet mostly gives the results of the house occupied by it and its owner comes next in order.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Of the houses, the angles stand 1st in strength, next the succedent and then the cadents.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The owner of the house 6, 8 or 12 (as counted from any particular house to be judged) becomes weak, evil or malefic in effects.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Strength by Sign: A planet is strong when it is in its own or exalted sign. It is weak or afflicted in its detriment or fall (debilitated) sign.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The nature of the sign (e.g. cardinal or movable, fixed, or common or mutable; fire, earth, air or water; fruitful or barren; human or bestial; mute or voice; masculine or feminine etc.) on the cusp and that occupied by a planet influences the affairs of the house and the planet.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Strength by Aspect: A planet in conjunction or association with or aspected by a malefic (i.e. the owner of 6, 8 or 12 from the house to be judged) becomes weak or afflicted.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   An aspecting planet modifies the results of the house matters according as it is a natural benefic or malefic, friendly or inimical.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In this system only Hindu aspects are to be considered.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Nakshatra System: A planet becomes strong if its star lord is strong by house, sign and aspect; and it will be in a position to give the results indicated by its star lord to a desired extent.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   A planet becomes weak if its star lord is weak by house, sign and aspect; and it will not be in a position to give the results indicated by its star lord to a desired extent.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   A planet 'Connected With':
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   1.
  </p>
<p>
   (a) Suppose Jupiter occupies Capricorn or Aquarius; or
  </p>
<p>
   (b) it is in the star or sub of Saturn; or
  </p>
<p>
   (c) it is in conjunction with or aspected by Saturn, then it may be said that Jupiter is connected with Saturn.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.
  </p>
<p>
   (a) Suppose Jupiter is the owner or star lord or sub lord of the ascending degree (the cusp of the 1st house or Asc); or
  </p>
<p>
   (b) it occupies the 1st house, or
  </p>
<p>
   (c) it aspects the 1st house; or
  </p>
<p>
   (d) it is in the star or sub of the occupant of the 1st house; or
  </p>
<p>
   (e) it is in the star or sub of the owner of the 1st house; or
  </p>
<p>
   (f) it is in conjunction with or aspected by the owner of the 1st house, then it may be said that Jupiter is connected with the 1st house.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.
  </p>
<p>
   Suppose Sun is in the star Jupiter owning 3, 12 and occupying 10; and it is in the sub Saturn owning 1, 2 and occupying 4.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   To facilitate distinction between the matters of the star lord and those of the sub lord, it may be said that Sun is the significator of 10, 3 and 12; and connected with 1, 2 and 4. This procedure has been adopted throughout the book.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Significator and its Sublord:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   1.	The significator shows the source of an event. The matters especially of the house or houses owned by it serve as the source.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.	The significator gives the results of its star lord. So the star lord becomes the indicator of the matters of the house occupied and owned by it and also of the house aspected by it.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.
  </p>
<p>
   (a) The sub lord of the significator is the deciding factor regarding the matters of the star lord.
  </p>
<p>
   (b) If the sub lord is harmonious to the matters indicated by the star lord, the significator gives favourable or desired or expected results.
  </p>
<p>
   (c) If the sub lord is detrimental to the matters indicated by the star lord, the significator does not give favourable or desired or expected results.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Consider the houses for the respective subject matter as shown in the above table.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the subject matter of the houses shown in the Column A is to be judged, then the subject matter of the houses shown in the Column B will become detrimental; and vice versa.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Suppose Sun is the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 4, 11 and 12, and the sub lord of Sun is not connected with 4, 11 or 12, but it is connected with 10, 5 and 3, then Sun will not be in a position to give the desired or expected results of 4, 11 and 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4.	The significator gives during its period, sub-period or inter-period the results of its star lord; or
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The results of the star lord are experienced during the joint period (i.e. during the period, sub-period and inter-period) of the significator, its star lord and its sub lord.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   5.	The significator denotes the time when it will give the results of its star lord. The sub lord of the significator shows whether desired results or otherwise will be obtained.
  </p>
<p>
   6.	The significator becomes weak if its star lord be weak; more so if its sub lord also be weak.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Cuspal Sub lord:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   1.	The cuspal sub lord of a house indicates whether the matter signified by that house is promised or denied.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the cuspal sub lord of that house is the significator of that house or any one of the houses under consideration, the matter signified by that house will be promised.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   As each house denotes several particular matters, the chief governor of the matter to be judged may be taken into consideration. If it be connected with the house or any one of the houses under consideration, especially with the star lord of the cuspal sub lord, it is desirable.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.	If the Cuspal sub lord of the house (Column I) is the significator (in the Star of the occupant or owner) of the house(s) (Column II), then only during the joint period of the Significators of the house(s) (Column III) the results of the expected matter (Column IV) are experienced.

<p>
   It so happens that the cuspal sub lord of the principal house under consideration is not found in the star of the occupant or of the owner of the house or houses under review. [Implying more complex rules apply in such cases].
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Sometimes Rahu or Ketu becomes the cuspal sub lord of the principal house under consideration and it occupies neither of the house or houses under review.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   But the cuspal sub lord, its star lord and its sub lord; also Rahu or Ketu are found to be connected with the principal house or houses under review in any manner.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In such cases we have to use our discretion in determining the happening of an event. So an overall view of the horoscope should be taken.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint Period Rulers: (Refers to Dasha/Bhukti/Antara rulers)
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   1.	The period or sub period ruler gives the results according to its natural rulership over certain affairs of life e.g. Venus is the chief governor of peace or harmony, marriage, vehicle or happiness etc.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.	It gives favourable or unfavourable results of its star lord according as its sub lord is favourable or unfavourable.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.	The period ruler, the sub period ruler or the inter period ruler each may signify matters of different houses i.e. different subject matters both desirable and undesirable. So during their joint period they will give the results of the common subject matter either desirable or undesirable as the case may be.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Suppose the period ruler is the significator of 2, 5 or 11 (child-birth) and 1, 4 or 10 (also its denial). Then during the sub period of the significator of 1, 4 or 10 there will be no child-birth and if there be any child already, separation from the child is likely. And during the sub period of the significator of 2, 5 or 11 the birth of a child will take place.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4.	If the star lord (of the period ruler etc.) occupies 6, 8 or 12 as counted from its own sign (house), then the period or sub period ruler will not give favourable results of this house (owned by its star lord).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   5.	If the planet and its star lord are in 6, 8 or 12 sign from each other (Shashtashtaka or Dwirdwadasa), the native will not get results to a desired extent during their joint period.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   6.	If the star lord of the period or sub period ruler be retrograde, the native will experience ups and downs in general.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   7.	The joint period rulers generally give the results of the house or houses owned by their star lords. So their strength will depend on the strength of their star lords.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8.	If the joint period rulers are in reception (in each other's sign), in conjunction or aspect with each other, they influence the affairs of each other. This is based on the principle that a planet in conjunction with or aspected by a significator gives the results of the house or houses denoted by that significator.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   9.	If the joint rulers of the cusp of any house be the significators of the matter signified by that house, the combined period of these joint rulers inter se gives the results of the same matter or during the period of any other significator of that house and in the sub period of the cuspal sub lord of that house the results of the same matter are obtained.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   An event generally happens during the joint period of the significators when the transit agrees.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   At the time of an event Sun, Moon or/and joint period rulers are generally found to be transitting in:
  </p>
<p>
   •	(a) the star or sub of the same joint period ruler or rulers (i.e. in the star or sub of the period, sub period, inter period or/and sookshma [minute] period ruler) or
  </p>
<p>
   •	(b) the star of the significator of that event (other than the joint period rulers) in the horoscope.
  </p>
