   12th cusp (Gemini 18° 42'): 1. In this horoscope Cancer 18° 27' is on the Asc. The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Moon. It is in the star Mars and in the sub Mercury. Moon owns the Asc. (native). The star lord Mars occupies 3. The sub lord Mercury owns 3 and 12. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 12 is the significator of 3 and connected with 3 and 12. Hence it promises foreign travel and stay abroad to the native.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2 (a) We may now consider Moon in respect of the native's parents. As counted from the 4th cusp (Libra 15° 42′), Moon is in the star Mars in 12 and in the sub Mercury owning 9 and 12. So Moon is the significator of 12 and connected with 9 and 12 for the mother.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) As counted from the 9th cusp (Pisces 13° 42′), Moon is in the star Mars owning 9 and in the sub Mercury in 12. So Moon is the significator of 9 and connected with 12 for the father. So Moon promises foreign travel and stay abroad to the parents after the birth of the native.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: 1. The native was born during the period of Mars with balance of 2Y. 10M. 13D. The period ruler Mars is in the star Mars and in the sub Mercury. As already discussed above, it is the strong significator of foreign travel both for the native and his parents. So they went abroad in the period of Mars.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2. During the joint period of Mars, Venus and Rahu the native's father started for London on 7-9-1968. All these three planets are the significators of foreign travel for the native's father.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3 (a) During the joint period of Mars, Venus and Ketu the native and his mother started for London on 14-3-1969 (Mars the period ruler is in association with Ketu and aspects Venus. So both Ketu and Venus become the significators of foreign travel).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) These three joint period rulers may be understood from another point of view. The period ruler Mars is in its own star and in the sub Mercury. The star lord Mars becomes the owner of 2 (family life) for the native's parents. The sub lord Mercury becomes the owner of 7 (wife) for the native's father.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus the sub period ruler is in the star Sun and in its own sub. The star lord Sun owns 2 and occupies 9 (father) for the native; it becomes the owner of 11 (meeting the kith and kin) for the native's mother. The sub lord Venus owns 4 (mother) and 11 for the native.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Ketu the inter period ruler is in the star Rahu and in the sub Ketu. The star lord Rahu is in association with Sun and aspected by Mars. The sub lord Ketu is in association with Mars and aspected by Sun.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus they indicate that the native, his mother and father will be in a position to live together. Hence these joint period rulers give scope for two coincidences e.g. one of travelling abroad and the other of their living together.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 14-3-1969 Sun Taurus 29°45′ was in the star Mars the period ruler. Mars Scorpio 13°41′ was in its own sign. Venus Aries 3° 4' was in the star Ketu the inter period ruler. Ketu Pisces 7°29′ was in its own sub.
