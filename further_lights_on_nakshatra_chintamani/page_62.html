   Transits And Nativities
  </h1>
<p>
   1.Transit in star: Saturn transits in one star for about 13 months. Rahu or Ketu 8 months. Jupiter for about 5 months and 10 days. Mars for 20 days or so. Mercury and Venus are not uniform in their motion. Sun is very regular in motion and stays in one star for about 13 days. Moon stays for about 24 hours in one star.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transit in sub: Saturn while transitting through one star remains in one sub for many weeks. Rahu, Ketu and Jupiter remain in one sub for many days. Sun remains in one sub for one day to three days, Moon for about three hours.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.Observe the influence of the transitting planets for every year, especially the transit of Saturn, because it is for a longer duration. If the transits of Rahu, Ketu and Jupiter get coincided in their influence with that of Saturn, there is a greater possibility of a particular happening.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   What is not indicated in the birth map cannot be expected to materialise during the period of the transitting planets, to the extent desired.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   It is generally a practice to observe the effects of transits in relation to the joint period rulers according to the Dasha system. This method of transits has been discussed in my book 'Nakshatra Chintamani.'
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.Here an attempt has been made to read solely the cumulative influence of the slow moving planets in transit eg. Saturn, Rahu, Ketu and Jupiter. Their effects during the spread over of 5 to 13 months are observed.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In the birth horoscope some planets are the significators of marriage (2, 7, 11), some of money (2, 6, 11), some of loss in money (8, 12), some of sickness (6, 8, 12), some of occupation (2, 6, 10) and so on. The stronger the significators are, the greater is the possibility of their results during a particular year under review.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Suppose all the above transitting planets are moving in the stars of the significators of money (2, 6, 11) and also in the subs connected with 2, 6 and 11 in the birth map. Then they become coincided in their influence. So your monetary condition may improve during this part of the year. But during the time when the above transitting planets move in the subs connected with 8 or 12 and not 2, 6 or 11 in the birth map, it is likely that you may lose money or you may have to spend much money on any account. When the above situation arises in a particular month, you will find that Sun might be transitting in the star or sub of the significator of 2, 6, 11 or 8, 12 in the birth map, as the case may be. If the above situation occurs on a particular day Moon might be transitting in the star or sub of the significator of 2, 6, 11 or 8, 12 in the birth map as the case may be.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Suppose the above transitting planets move in the stars of the significators of 2, 6 and 11 during a particular year under review. But their star lords remain in retrograde motion for some time. Then it will not be possible to expect any desired result till they become direct in motion. More so, if they be in the retrograde subs.
