<p>
   Query: Whether I will be able to have the position as a research and development engineer ?
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moon: In this horary map Moon is in conjunction with Jupiter owning 6 (service), it is aspected by Mars owning 10 (position, status), it occupies 11 (fulfilment of desire). Thus Moon indicates that the querent desires to have a job of his choice.

   11th cusp (Taurus 3° 46'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Saturn. It owns 9 (research) and it is in the 1st (self). It is retrograde and it is a slow moving planet. Hence the querent has to keep patience. It is in the star and the sub MercuryD in 9; Mercury is in conjunction with the owner of 11 (Venus). So Saturn is the significator of 9 and connected with 9 and 11. Hence the querent's desire to obtain the position as a research and development engineer will be fulfilled after patience for long.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   6th cusp (Sagittarius 5° 34'): The sub lord of the 6th cusp is Rahu. It is in the star Mars owning 10 and in the sub Ketu in 10. None of them is retrograde. Rahu in Libra represents Venus owning 11 (success). So Rahu is the significator of 10 and connected with 9, 10 and 11. Hence the querent will get the job as a research engineer and he will be successful.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   10th cusp (Aries 0° 46'): The sub lord of the 10th cusp is Ketu. It is in its own star in 10 and in the sub Venus owning 11 in 9. So Ketu is the significator of 10 and connected with 9 and 11. Hence the querent will get the position as a research and development engineer and he will get success.

   Ruling Planets:
  </p>
<p>
   Day lord	Sign lord	Star lord
  </p>
<p>
   Day:	Saturday	Sat.	-	-
  </p>
<p>
   Asc.:	Gemini 26° 0'	-	Mer.	Jup.
  </p>
<p>
   Moon:	Taurus 24° 18'	-	Ven.	Mars
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu is in Libra, so it represents Venus. Ketu is in Aries, so it represents Mars. Hence Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu become the ruling planets.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   All these planets are the significators of 9 and connected with 6, 9, 10 or 11. Saturn and Venus are retrograde, but they get direct from 11-4-1977 and 27-4-1977 respectively. Hence they will give results.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: At the time of judgment (Mars period with balance of 6Y. 5M. 27D.). The querent was running the joint period of Mars and Rahu.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The period ruler Mars is among the ruling planets and it is the significator of 11 and connected with 9 and 10. The cuspal sub lord of 11 Saturn is also the ruling planet and it is the significator of 9 and connected with 9 and 11.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the period ruler be the significator of an expected event the event occurs during the joint period of the period ruler and the cuspal sub lord of 11 (if it be the desired significator). The joint period of Mars and Saturn continues from 14-2-1979 to 23-3-1980. So the querent's desire is likely to be fulfilled during this time.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The querent desires the position as a research and development engineer. The 9th house is connected with the research work. Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are the significators of the 9th. They are among the ruling planets.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In the period of Mars during the sub period of Saturn the inter period of Mercury follows immediately after Saturn. It starts from 17-4-1979 and lasts upto 13-6-1979. Hence the querent will get the desired position within that time.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The querent informed me that he joined his duties on 1-5-79. Thus the event happened during the joint period of Mars, Saturn, Mercury and Venus. It may be noted that Mercury the inter period ruler is the sub lord of the Asc (querent). In short, the period ruler Mars owns 10 (position), the sub period ruler Saturn owns 9 (research), the inter period ruler Mercury owns 12 (change of environments) and the sookshma period
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 1-5-1979 Sun Aries 16° 30' was in the star Venus the sookshma period ruler. Mars Pisces 25° was in the star Mercury the inter period ruler. Saturn Leo 13° 40' was in the star Venus. Mercury Pisces 21° was in its own star. Venus Pisces 16° was in the star Saturn the sub period ruler.
