   ASC (Cancer 19°51'):The sub lord of the Asc. is Venus. It is in the star Venus and in the sub Rahu. The star lord Venus owns 4, 11 and occupies 2. The sub lord Rahu occupies 2. Both Venus and Rahu are in conjunction with the owner of 2 Sun and the owner of 5 and 10 Mars. Thus the sub lord of the Asc. is the significator of 4 (ancestral property), 11 (gain, prosperity), 2 (wealth), 5-10 (prosperity) and connected with these houses, Sun (royal paraphernalia) and Leo (regal sign). Hence the native's princely status from birth.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   12th cusp (Gemini 19° 30'): The 12th house denotes misfortune, calamities, insults, exile and unexpected troubles. The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Mars. It is in the star Ketu and in the sub Saturn. The star Ketu occupies 8 and is aspected by Mars. The sub Saturn owns 8 and is in conjunction with the owner of 12 (Mercury). So the cuspal sub lord of 12 is the strong significator of 8 (misfortune) and connected with 8, 12 and malefics Mars, Ketu and Saturn. Hence the sudden calamity and misfortune.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Rahu with balance of 2Y. 5M. 29D.. The owners of 6, 8 and 12 denote misfortune, so the joint period of the planets in their stars brings calamities and misfortune. In this horoscope there are no planets in the stars of Saturn owning 8 and Mercury owning 12. Jupiter owning 6 is in its own star. Hence Saturn, Mercury and Jupiter are the strong significators of 8, 12 and 6 respectively.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Saturn, Mercury and Jupiter the calamity befell the ex-king Peter II of Ugoslavia. His royal possessions were confiscated by the Communist authority and he was divested of his citizenship on 8-3-1947.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 8-3-1947 Sun Aquarius 24° was in the star Jupiter the inter period ruler. Saturn Cancer 9°33′ was in its own star the period ruler. Mercury Aquarius 24° 56' was in the star Jupiter. Jupiter Scorpio 4° 29' was in the star Saturn.
