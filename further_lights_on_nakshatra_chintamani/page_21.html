   Example Nativities - 17.Kidney
  </h1>
<p>
   1 (a) ASC (Sagittarius 26° 16'): The sublord of the Asc is Ketu. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Saturn.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   6th cusp (Gemini 1° 29'): The sub lord of the 6th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Rahu.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8th cusp (Leo 1° 29'): The sub lord of the 8th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Ketu.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   12th cusp (Sagittarius 1° 29'). The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Venus.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Among the above said planets Sun owns 8; Mercury the owner of 6, Ketu, Saturn and Venus are in the 8th. Sun, Venus, Ketu and Saturn are in association with one another.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (b) Thus the above cuspal sub lords Ketu, Mercury and Venus are the significators of 8. So they denote serious disease.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (c) None of them is in the star of the occupant or owner of 1, 5 or 11. So the disease might not be cured.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   (d) The cuspal sub lord of 8 (serious disease and operation) and 12 (defect in the part of the body and hospitalisation) is Venus in 8. So it denotes kidney. As it is in conjunction with Saturn and Ketu (resembles Mars) the disease will be chronic and lingering, it might not be diagnosed and the native may have to undergo operations.

   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Rahu with balance of 3Y. 0M. 22D. Thereafter, the native will run the periods of Jupiter and Saturn respectively. Jupiter is the significator of 11. Saturn is the significator of 8. So it is likely that the native may suffer from disease during the joint periods of Saturn and Mercury (the cuspal sub lord of 6), Saturn and Ketu (the sub lord of the Asc.), Saturn and Venus (the cuspal sub lord of 8 and 12).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In the joint period of Saturn and Mercury the disease could not be diagnosed. But later on in the month of February 1975 during the joint period of Saturn, Mercury and Saturn, it was observed that the native suffered from the trouble of kidney.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   On 18-2-1976 during the joint period of Saturn, Ketu and Jupiter the old kidney was replaced by a new one.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Saturn, Venus and Mars in the month of August 1977 a newly transplanted kidney which was not functioning properly was removed by operation.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The third operation was undergone in the month of November 1977 during the joint period of Saturn, Venus, Rahu and Saturn.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During the joint period of Saturn, Venus, Rahu and Mercury, another new kidney was transplanted on 22-12-1977 by way of operation.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 18-2-1976 Sun Aquarius 5° 3′ was in the star Mars the significator of 8. Moon Virgo 7°3′ was in the sub Ketu the inter period ruler. Saturn Cancer 3° 56' was in its own star the period ruler. Ketu Aries 23°19′ was in the sub Saturn. Jupiter Pisces 28° 39' was in the sub Saturn.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   On 22-12-1977 Sun Sagittarius 6° 36′ was in the sub Rahu the inter period ruler. Moon Aries 29° 14' to Taurus 1° was in the sub Rahu. Saturn Leo 7° 1' was in the sub Rahu. Venus Scorpio 29° 7' was in the star Mercury the sookshma period ruler. Rahu Virgo 17° 39' was in the sub Saturn the period ruler. Mercury Sagittarius 5° 36' was in the sub Ranu.
