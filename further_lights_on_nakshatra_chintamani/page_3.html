   Horoscope Diagram Explained: In this book for the sake of facility in printing, the horoscope is written in the form of a ladder by drawing one vertical line in the middle and five horizontal lines intersecting the vertical line. The ends of the vertical line and the ends of the horizontal lines serve as the cusps (beginning points) of the houses; and signs and degrees have been marked thereon and the planets have been written either below or above the cuspal signs as the case may be, as shown in the diagram on page 21.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The cusps and planets of Nirayana horoscopes are written in the manner of a western horoscope and for the purposes of this book in the Nirayana horoscope the cusp of a house has been considered as the commencing point.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The ascendant or the ascending degree of the sign is marked at the top of the vertical line. Then below it on the left side other signs and degrees are written at the ends of the horizontal lines and each house is given a serial number in an anti-clockwise direction.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Inserting Signs and Planets: In the given horoscope on page 21. Aquarius 29° 8' is placed on the cusp of the 1st house i. e, as the Asc, at the top. Then below the Asc. on the left side Aries 6° 42' on the cusp of the 2nd house; Taurus 6° 42' on the 3rd; Gemini 1° 42' on the 4th; Gemini 26° 42' on the 5th; Cancer 23° 42' on the 6th and so on. In this way the signs and degrees on all the 12 cusps of the houses have been written down in an anti-clockwise direction.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The cusp of the 6th house begins with Cancer 23° 42'. The longitude of Jupiter in Cancer is 8° 48'. It is less than the cuspal degree of the 6th house. So it is placed behind the cuspal degree of the 6th house and it may be considered as posited in the 5th house. Jupiter will exert its influence on the 5th house.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If a planet is within 5° of the cuspal degree of a house, it exerts its influence on both the houses. In this map Mercury in Taurus is 2°, while the cuspal degree of the 3rd house begins with Taurus 6° 42'. As the longitude of Mercury is less than the cuspal degree, it is placed behind the cuspal degree. But as Mercury is within 5° of the cuspal degree it is said to be on the cusp of the 3rd and it will exert some influence both on the 2nd and 3rd houses.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The cusp of the 8th house begins with Libra 6°42'. The longitude of Saturn in Libra is 23°56'. It is greater than the cuspal degree. So it is placed in front of Libra 6°42' and it is said to be in the 8th house.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   All the houses in the horoscope are not of equal dimensions: The house may be less or greater than 30 degrees. Some times one house may contain more than one sign. Such a sign is termed as 'intercepted'.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In this map the 4th house commences from Gemini 1°42' and extends upto Gemini 26°42'. So the 4th house is of 25° dimension.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The 6th house commences from Cancer 23°42' and ends at Leo 29°8'. So the 6th house consists of 35°26' and so on with other houses.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In this map the Asc. begins with Aquarius. 29°8' and ends at Aries 6°42'. So the whole sign Pisces is contained in the 1st house and Pisces is termed as 'intercepted'. Hence the 1st house contains more than one sign and it is of 37°34' dimension. Venus in Pisces is 29°42'. So it is placed in front of Pisces in the first house and it will exert its influence on the Ist house.
