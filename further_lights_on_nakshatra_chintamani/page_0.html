   Foreword
  </h1>
<p>
   Shri Chandrakant R. Bhatt B.A., L.L.B. is an eminent Astrologer of Gujarat. He has several books in the Gujarati language on Astrology to his credit. His profound insight into the interpretation of horoscopes both in Sayan (Tropical) and Nirayan (Sidereal) Charts is really amazing.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In order to contribute to the spread of knowledge of Indian Astrology, both in India and Abroad, we have already published his two books written in English: 1. Nakshatra Chintamani, 2. Horoscopes &amp; Diseases. These two books have been very warmly received and appreciated by the students of Astrology both in India and Abroad.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   'Further Lights on Nakshatra Chintamani' is the third book written by Shri Bhatt in English. This book by Shri Bhatt throws more light on the principles of predicting, enunciated in his first book 'Nakshatra Chintamani' and is profusely illustrated with example horoscopes.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moreover, he has outlined the principles of predicting in simple, precise and penetrating words to enable the students of Astrology to master them in no time and arrive at a quick and straight analysis of the horoscopes and correct conclusions.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Shri Bhatt being a master of both Western and Indian Systems of Astrology, has added an interesting and enlightening chapter on how to analyse and interpret Nirayan Horoscopes in a Sayan way with appropriate tables for fixing aspects.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moreover, he has discussed transits of slow-moving planets in a separate chapter and thrown a very useful light on predicting from the transits of these planets independently of Dasha-Bhukti System of Predicting.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The principles of predicting enunciated in this book are on the basis of Nakshatras and their sub-divisions and the planets and the cusps of the houses therein. This method of predicting is an age-old method already promulgated by our sages. But its method of approach at present is in a controversial stage, partly because it is emphatically coined as a new invention which in fact is not, and advocated as the only and perfect method of predicting.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Our interest in publishing this book is purely an academic one and we shall be satisfied if the students and scholars of Astrology study this book in a comparative way with their own and with other methods of predicting and harmonise and synthesise them in the best interest of Astrology which is our heritage and which is so ardently preserved and preached by the wizards like late Shri Suryanarayan Rao, the founder of the 'Astrological Magazine' and its present Editor Shri B.V. Raman who has popularized Indian Astrology both in India and Abroad and has created a convincing stage for the recognition of Indian Astrology as a science and have its place in our Universities as a branch of knowledge.
