   Example Horary Maps - 4. Transfer in Service
  </h1>
<p>
   Query: There are two posts suitable to me at two different places. I desire my posting on one of the posts at any of the two places. If so, when ?
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hints: If the cuspal sub lord of 3 (journey, absence of the present residence, 3rd is 12th from the 4th i.e. change of place) or 12 (life in completely unfamiliar atmosphere) be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 3 or 12 and connected with 10, the querent if in service, will be transferred from the present place to another place.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   If the sub lord of the 10th cusp be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 3 or 12, the transfer in service from one place to another.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The transfer takes place during the joint period of the significators of 3, 10 and 12.

   Moon: In this horary map Moon owns 3. It is in conjunction with Mars owning 12 and Venus owning 6 (service). Its star lord Sun occupies 12. Its sub lord Rahu is in conjunction with Saturn owning 10 (position, status) and 11 (fulfilment of desire). Thus Moon reveals the mind of the querent that he desires one of the two posts at any of the two places of his choice.

   Jupiter in 3. So the cuspal sub lord of 3 is the significator of 6, 12 and connected with 3 and 10. None of these planets is retrograde. Hence the querent will have his transfer at any of the two places of his choice.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   12th cusp (Aries 5° 48'): The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Rahu. Hence the position will be as above.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   10th cusp (Capricorn 28° 10'): The sub lord of the 10th cusp is Saturn. It owns 10, it is in the star and the sub Venus owning 6 and occupying 12. So the cuspal sub lord of 10 is the significator of 12, 6 and connected with 12, 6 and 10. None of these planets is retrograde. Hence the position as above.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Aquarius 29° 10'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Sun. It is in its own star in 12 and in the sub Venus in 12. So the cuspal sub lord of 11 is the strong significator of 12 and connected with 12. None of them is retrograde. Hence the querent's desire will be fulfilled, i.e. he will have his environments changed according as he intends.

   Ruling Planets:

<p>
   Day lord	Sign lord	Star lord
  </p>
<p>
   Day:	Friday	Ven.	-	-
  </p>
<p>
   Asc.:	Gemini 22°	-	Mer.	Jup.
  </p>
<p>
   Moon:	Aries 29° 20'	-	Mars	Sun
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu is in Leo, so it represents Sun. Hence the ruling planets are Sun, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Rahu.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: At the time of judgment (Sun period with balance of 4Y. 9M. 18D.) the querent was running the joint period of Sun and Rahu. Both Sun and Rahu are among the ruling planets. The period ruler Sun is the cuspal sub lord of 11 and the sub period ruler Rahu is the cuspal sub lord of 3 and 12. They are the significators of 3 and 12. So the querent's desire will be fulfilled during the joint period of Sun and Rahu.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In the period of Sun during the sub period of Rahu the inter period of Jupiter follows immediately after Rahu. Jupiter is the ruling planet, it is the significator (in the star Saturn owning 10 and 11 and in the sub Sun in 12) of 10, 11 and connected with 12. Further its star lord Saturn is in conjunction with the sub period ruler (Rahu) and its sub lord Sun is the period ruler. So during the joint period of Sun, Rahu and Jupiter (26-6-1979 to 9-8-1979) the querent's desire will be fulfilled.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The querent informed me that he received the order for the desired post at the desired place on 23-7-1979. Thus the event happened during the joint period of Sun, Rahu, Jupiter and Venus (18-7-1979 to 25-7-1979). Venus the owner of 6 is in its own star and sub in 12, so it is the significator of 12 and connected with 12. It is also the ruling planet.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 23-7-1979 Moon Cancer 0° 18' was in the star Jupiter the inter period ruler. Rahu Leo 16° 59' was in the star Venus the sookshma period ruler. Jupiter Cancer 22° 1' was in the sub Sun the period ruler. Venus Gemini 27° 31' was in the star Jupiter.
