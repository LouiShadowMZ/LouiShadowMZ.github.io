   Query: Whether I shall be successful in my attempts to obtain the Green card during my stay in U. S A.?
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moon: In this horary map Moon occupies 11 (success or fulfilment of desire), it is in conjunction with the benefic Jupiter in its own sign Pisces. It is in the sub Saturn owning 11. Thus Moon refers to the query regarding success or fulfilment of desire.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Asc. (Taurus 11° 6' 40"): The sub lord of the Asc (efforts of the querent) is Mars. It owns 12 and occupies the 1st. It is in the star Moon in 11 and in the sub Sun in 9. None of them is retrograde. Thus the Asc. sub lord is the significator of 11 (success) and connected with 9, 12 (foreign land) and 1 (efforts). Hence the querent will be successful in his attempts in the foreign land.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   11th cusp (Aquarius 28° 28'): The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Venus owning 1, 6 and occupying 8 and it is in the sub Jupiter owning 8 and occupying 11. None of them is retrograde. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 11 is the significator of 1, 6 (success), 8 (disappointment) and connected with 8 and 11. Hence the querent's desire will ultimately be fulfilled after feeling some disappointment.
  </p>
<p>

<p>
   Ruling Planets:

   Day lord	Sign lord	Star lord
  </p>
<p>
   Day:	Friday	Ven.	-	-
  </p>
<p>
   Asc.:	Aries 25° 2'	-	Mars	Ven.
  </p>
<p>
   Moon:	Pisces 29° 57'	-	Jup.	Mer.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Rahu is in Libra, so it represents Venus. Ketu is in Aries, so it represents Mars. Hence the ruling planets are Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Rahu and Ketu.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mars and Rahu are the significators of 11; while Venus and Ketu are the significators of 1 and 6.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: At the time of judgment (Mercury period with balance of 0Y. 0M. 23D) the querent is running the joint period of Mercury and Saturn. The period of Ketu commences from 29-2-1976. It is among the ruling planets and it is the significator of 1 and 6.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In the period of Ketu the querent will have to run the sub periods of Venus, Mars and Rahu. All of them are the ruling planets and also the significators of 1, 6 and 11. But the querent has to feel some disappointment in the first instance and as Rahu is considered to be stronger than any other significator, the querent's desire is likely to be fulfilled during the joint period of Ketu, Rahu (the cuspal sub lord of 3-correspondence) and Venus (the cuspal sub lord of 11) which starts from 1-10-1979 and continues upto 4-12-1979.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The querent informed me that he was called for an interview on 25-10-1979 and the Green card was granted to him.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 25-10-1979 2-30 P.M. Central Day light Saving Time-U.S.A. Sun Libra 8° 20' was in the star Rahu the sub period ruler. Moon Sagittarius 4° was in the star Ketu the period ruler. Ketu Aquarius 11° 59' was in the star Rahu. Rahu Leo 11° 59' was in the star Ketu. Venus Libra 24° 30' was in its own sign.
