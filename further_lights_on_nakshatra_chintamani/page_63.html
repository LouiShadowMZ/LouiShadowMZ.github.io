   2.In 1979 Saturn Leo 20°25'R - 13°37'D - Virgo 3°30', Rahu Leo 27°46' - 8°29', Ketu Aquarius 27°46' - 8°29'.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In 1980 Saturn Virgo 3°30' - 3°32'R - Leo 26°43'D - Virgo 15°59'. Rahu Leo 8°25' - Cancer 19°15', Ketu Aquarius 8°25" Capricorn 19° 15".

   3.In this birth map the publication of books is indicated. Mercury (writings), Jupiter (publications), Mars (printing), the houses 3 (writings), 9 (publications), 10 (publicity) and 11 (success) are connected with writings, publications and printing.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Sun, Venus and Jupiter are the significators of 3 and 10, they are inter-related with one another. Rahu and Mercury are related with each other and they both are related with Jupiter, they are the significators of 9. Ketu is the significator of 9 and 11, it is connected with Mars and Mercury. Moon is also the significator of 9 and connected with Mercury, Jupiter and Mars. Hence the writings and their publications are promised. So all these planets are the significators of the publication of books.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4.When Saturn, Rahu and Ketu simultaneously transit in the stars and subs of these significators of writings and publications, during a particular year under review, the affairs of writings and publications will be active.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   5.In this birth map during 1979 Saturn transits in the star Venus; from 4-10-1979 in the star Sun and from 20-10-1980 in the star Moon.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During 1979 Rahu in the star Sun; from 22-1-1979 in the star Venus; from 1-10-1979 in the star Ketu and from 9-6-1980 in the star Mercury.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   During 1979 Ketu in the star Jupiter; from 28-5-1979 in the star Rahu; from 3-2-1980 in the star Mars and from 12-10-1980 in the star Moon.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Thus the transits of Saturn, Rahu and Ketu coincided in their influence and they were also in the subs of these significators. Hence books of the native were printed and published during 1979 and 1980.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   6.It was observed that if the planet in transit be retrograde, there was retardation in the progress of publications. In this case Saturn was retrograde upto 10-5-1979, so the printing work was slow. But thereafter it was very swift and the books were completely printed by November 1979.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Another book was under print during November 1979. In this case Jupiter in Leo was retrograde from 27-12-1979 to 26-4-1980, Mars in transit remained in Leo from 7-11-1979 upto 28-6-1980 and it turned retrograde from 17-1-1980 to 7-4-1980. Saturn in Virgo became retrograde from 7-1-1980 and Saturn in Leo was direct from 23-5-1980. Though they were retrograde, they were in the stars of direct moving planets. So the printing work was not completely stopped. However, the composition work was very slow and it was going on intermittently due to the shortage of employees in the press.
