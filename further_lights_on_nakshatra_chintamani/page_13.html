   Unnatural Death:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   ASC (Gemini 20° 25'): The sub lord of the Asc. is Jupiter. It is in the star and sub Saturn. Jupiter is the owner of the badhaka house 7. Saturn owns 8, it is in association with Mars owning 6, Ketu and Venus owning 12; it is aspected by the badhaka house owner (Jupiter) and Moon the owner of the maraka house 2; it is in the violent sign Scorpio. Thus the Asc. sub lord is connected with the badhaka-maraka houses, malefics (Mars, Saturn, Ketu) and the violent sign; so it denotes an unnatural death. But Jupiter owns the angles and not 6, 8 or 12; it occupies its own sign in the 9th, it is not aspected by any malefic. Hence the middle life (33 to 66 years).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Imprisonment:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hints: If the sub lord of the 12th cusp (jail) be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 3 (away from home), 8 (misfortune) or 12 (restrictions) and connected with malefics, one has to court jail during the joint period of the significators of 3, 8 and 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   12th cusp (Taurus 18°15'): The sub lord of the 12th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Venus and in the sub Rahu. Mercury owns the Asc. and is on the 7th cusp, it is in conjunction with the owner of 3 (Sun). The star lord Venus owns 12, it is in association with Saturn owning 8, Ketu and Mars. The sub lord Rahu is in 12 and aspected by Mars, Saturn and Venus owning 12. Thus the cuspal sub lord of 12 is the significator of 12 and connected with 3, 8 and 12; also with malefics. So the native shall have to court jail.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Criminal Proceedings:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hints: If the sub lord of the 10th cusp (status) be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of 7 (court proceedings),8 (infamy) or 12 (crimes) and connected with malefics the native will be involved in court proceedings relating to crimes, will be disreputed and will be inflicted with punishment, during the joint period of the significators of 7, 8 and 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   10th cusp (Pisces 9°15'): The sub lord of the 10th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Saturn and in its own sub. The star lord Saturn owns 8, it is in association with Mars (crimes), Ketu and the owner of 12. The sub lord Venus owns 12; it is in association with Mars, Saturn and Ketu. The star Saturn and the sub Venus both are aspected by the owner of 7 (Jupiter). Thus the cuspal sub lord of 10 is the significator of 8 and connected with 12, 7; also with malefics (Mars, Saturn, Ketu). So the native will be involved in criminal proceedings, he will be disreputed and he will meet with punishment.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mental Qualities:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hints: The sub lord of the Asc., Moon and Mercury denote mental qualities. If they be in the star and sub of malefics connected with 6, 8 or 12 they signify conspirative, criminative, diplomatic, malicious, revengeful, relentless, shrewd, crafty and intriguing traits.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   ASC (Gemini 20° 25'): The sub lord of the Asc. is Jupiter. It is in the intellectual house 9 in Pisces (corresponds to 12-intrigues, crimes). It is in the star and sub Saturn owning 8 and occupying 6. Saturn is in association with Mars owning 6, Ketu in 6 and it aspects Rahu in 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moon (Taurus 28° 15'): It is in the star Mars and in the sub Saturn.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mercury (Sagittarius 19° 2'): It is in the star Venus owning 12 in Scorpio and in the sub Rahu in 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Moreover, Saturn the diplomat and Mars the aggressor are in Scorpio. Hence designing and tricky.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Political Career:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hints: Saturn denotes diplomacy; Sun government, power, position, name and fame; Jupiter dignity and wisdom; Mars coercion, controlling power and dominance; Rahu politics and government.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius; cardinal signs; angular houses; houses 9, 10 and 11 are to be considered in cases of politics and public life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Asc. denotes inclination; 10th cusp ambitions; 11th cusp realisation of ambitions and aspirations, success in general. So if the sub lord of the Asc., 10th cusp and 11th cusp be the strong significator of 9, 10 and 11 the native plunges into the public life or he shines out as a statesman or politician. It may be remembered that a planet owning both the Trikona and Kendra gives prosperity in general.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   ASC (Gemini 20° 25'): The sub lord of the Asc. is Jupiter. It is in the star and sub Saturn. Jupiter owns 10 and occupies 9 in Pisces. Saturn owns 9 and occupies 6 in Scorpio. So the native was inclined to politics.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   10th cusp (Pisces 9° 15'): The sub lord of the 10th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Saturn and in its own sub. The star lord Saturn owns 9, in conjunction with Mars owning 11, aspected by Jupiter owning 10 and it aspects Rahu; it is in the subtle and crafty sign Scorpio. The sub lord Venus is also in aspect to Saturn, Mars, Rahu and Jupiter. The cuspal sub lord of 10 is the strong significator of 9, 10 and 11; also connected with 9, 10 and 11. So the native was a very shrewd diplomat and a politician. He excercised supreme powers.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Sun and Mercury are in Sagittarius, the farsighted.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Calamities:
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: The native was born during the period of Mars with balance of 4Y. 5M. 1D. The houses 6, 8 and 12 are for mishaps. So calamities befall the native during the joint period of the significators of 6, 8 and 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In this horoscope the occupants of 6 Mars, Saturn and Ketu are the strong significators of 7 (badhaka, court proceedings) and 3 (leaving home) and connected with 12 (crimes, misfortune, detention, life in solitude), 7 and 3. The occupants of 12 Rahu and Moon are the strong significators of 12, 6 and connected with 7 and 8 (misfortune, calamity).
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The 8th cusp (Capricorn 13° 15') is jointly ruled by Saturn (sign lord), Moon (star lord) and Rahu (sub lord). These joint rulers are the significators of mishaps as discussed above. So their joint period may be observed, because the 8th cusp denotes misfortune, privations, blame, ill-repute, disappointment etc.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
