   4th cusp (Aquarius 1° 11'): It becomes the Asc. for the native's mother. As counted from the 4th cusp the period ruler Jupiter becomes the owner of the mother's maraka houses 12 and 2, it is retrograde. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Rahu. The star lord Sun is the owner of 7 and occupies 12 of the mother. The sub lord Rahu is in the 1st of the mother.

   The star lord Sun is in conjunction with Saturn owning 1 and Mercury owning 6 and 8 of the mother. So it becomes malefic and afflicted.

<p>
   The sub lord Rahu is aspected by the retrograde malefic Mars and the owner of the mother's maraka houses 12 and 2 (Jupiter). So it becomes malefic and affliced.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hence the period ruler Jupiter is the strong significator of the mother's maraka houses 7 and 12 and connected with the Asc. of the mother. It becomes more malefic because its star lord and sub lord both are malefic and afflicted. So its period will prove fatal to the life of the native's mother.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mother's 8th cusp (Virgo 3° 11'): The sub period ruler Saturn is the sub lord of the mother's 8th cusp. It is in the star Moon and in the sub Jupiter. Saturn owns 1 and it is in conjunction with Sun owning the maraka house 7 and Mercury owning 6 and 8 in the 12th of the mother.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The star lord Moon is in conjunction with Rahu the malefic in the Ist of the mother. It is aspected by the malefic Mars and the owner of the mother's maraka houses 12 and 2 Jupiter (the sub lord of Saturn). Thus both Moon and Jupiter are malefic in effect to the mother.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hence the cuspal sub lord of 8 becomes afflicted and malefic for the mother. Saturn denotes lingering sickness. It is connected with 6, 8, 12 and also the maraka houses 2 and 7 of the mother. So after the birth of the native his mother will suffer from lingering disease.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Mother's Asc. (Aquarius 1° 11'): The sub lord of the mother's Asc. is Mercury. It is in the star Sun and in the sub Venus. As counted from the 4th cusp (mother's Asc.) Mercury owns 6, 8 and occupies 12.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The star lord Sun owns the maraka house 7 and occupies the maraka house 12. It is in conjunction with Saturn owning 1 and Mercury owning 6 and 8.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The sub lord Venus owns the badhaka house 9. It is aspected by the owner of 2 and 12 JupiterR.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   As both the star lord and the sub lord become malefic and afflicted, the sub lord of the mother's Asc. becomes more malefic and afflicted. It is also the significator of the maraka houses 7, 12 and connected with the badhaka house, also the maraka houses of the mother.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Joint period: After the sub period of Saturn, the sub period of Mercury starts from 9-4-1935 and continues upto 15-7-1937. So the joint period of Jupiter and Mercury will prove fatal to the life of the native's mother.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   In fact during the joint period of Jupiter (the maraka significator), Mercury (the badhaka-maraka significator, also the sub lord of the mother's Asc.) and Venus (the badhaka significator, also the sub lord of the badhaka cusp 9th of the mother) the native's mother died on 27-10-1935.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Venus the inter period ruler is in its own star owning the badhaka house 9 and in the sub Mercury owning 6 and 8 of the mother.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The native lost his mother in infancy when he was only 2 years of age.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Transits: On 27-10-1935, Sun Libra 10° was in the sub Jupiter the period ruler. Venus Leo 25° was in its own star the inter period ruler. Mercury Virgo 24° was in the star Mars the strong maraka significator. Moon in Libra was in the sign owned by Venus.
