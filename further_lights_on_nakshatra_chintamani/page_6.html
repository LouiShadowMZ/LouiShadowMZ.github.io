   Example Nativities - 3. Infant Mortality
  </h1>
<p>
   Hints: 1. If the sub lord of the Asc. (ascending degree) be the owner of the house:
  </p>
<p>
   (a) 6, 8 or 12 a short life (upto 33 years) is indicated.
  </p>
<p>
   (b) 1, 5, 9 or 10 a long life (beyond 66 years).
  </p>
<p>
   (c) 6, 8 or 12 and 1, 5, 9, or 10 a middle life (upto 66 years) is denoted.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Besides, if this sub lord be the significator (in the star of the occupant or owner) of the badhaka and the maraka houses, it is not a good sign for long life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Likewise, consider the sub lords of the 3rd and the 8th cusps also.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   2.
  </p>
<p>
   The houses 1, 8 and 3 are for longevity. The 12th to any particular house denotes non-existence of the matter signified by that particular house. So the houses 12 (12th to 1), 7 (12th to 8) and 2 (12th to 3) are known as the maraka (death dealing) houses.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The house 11 is badhaka (harmful to life) to those born in movable signs as their Asc; the 9th for those born in fixed signs and the 7th for those born in common signs.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   The badhaka houses are more harmful than the maraka houses. So for death consider first the badhaka house and then the maraka house. Saturn is the chief governor of longevity.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   3.
  </p>
<p>
   There is danger to life during the joint period of the significators of the badhaka and maraka houses.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   4.
  </p>
<p>
   Suppose the joint rulers of the Asc, or 8th or 12th cusp be the significators of the badhaka and maraka houses and the native is born during the joint period of these joint rulers, then their joint period is very critical for life.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   ASC (Aries 10°27'): The Asc. is jointly ruled by Mars (sign lord), Ketu (star lord), Saturn (sub lord) and Sun (sub sub. lord). They all are the significators of the badhaka and maraka houses.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   8th cusp (Scorpio 10°52'): It is jointly governed by Mars (sign lord), Saturn (star lord), Sun (sub lord) and Ketu (sub sub lord). These joint rulers are similar to those of the Asc. So they also are the significators of the badhaka and maraka houses.
