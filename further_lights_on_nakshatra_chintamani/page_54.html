   Example Horary Maps - Moon and Querent's Mind
  </h1>
<p>
   Moon is the mind. So in the horary map the mind of the querent is shown by the position of Moon and it helps in knowing the nature of the question asked.

<p>
   Generally Moon or its star lord or its sub lord occupies or owns the house under query; or Moon is connected with the house of query by conj. or association with, or by aspect, from the owner or occupant of that house or from the chief governor of the matter asked.
