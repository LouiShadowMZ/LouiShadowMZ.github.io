Its star lord Sun owns 12, it aspects the 4th, it is in conjunction with Saturn(land) and Venus the significator of 4. So Rahu is the significator of 4, 12 and connected with Saturn. Mercury is in the star Moon and in its own sub. Its star lord Moon owns 11, it is aspected by the owner of 4 Mars. Its sub lord Mercury aspects 4. So Mercury is the significator of 4 and connected with 4 and Mars. Hence he could occupy the house and began to stay there.
