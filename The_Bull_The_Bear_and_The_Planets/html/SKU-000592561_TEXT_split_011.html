<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">The financial markets are a dynamic entity fueled by many factors, some of which we can easily comprehend, some of which are esoteric. Astrological phenomena can drive price action and create trend changes across both short and longer term time horizons. This book has introduced you to an extensive range of astrological phenomena and shown you numerous examples to illustrate how these phenomena impact various markets. With the information gleaned from this book, I sincerely hope you will now feel compelled to make astrology a companion to technical chart analysis as you trade the markets. I further hope that as you do so, you will come to view the financial markets in a very different way.</span></p>
