<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">Call me a rebel. Call me a radical. I have never been one to resign myself to mainstream thinking. In 2002, when I decided to become an Investment Advisor, I joined a small investment firm in western Canada that had a reputation for thinking outside the box. I was mentored by two seasoned Investment Advisors who deepened my understanding of technical chart analysis. I learned that markets shift from being in an uptrend to being in a downtrend and back again across both short and longer time horizons. I learned that if I followed these trend changes using technical chart analysis I would be in tune with the rhythm of the markets. This refreshing approach represented a clear break from the academic financial theory espoused as part of the exam regimen required for the licensing process with the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. And thus began my quest to delve into the uncanny and esoteric forces that align with trend changes in the financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">In 2003, after a series of reflective discussions with a fellow Investment Advisor, I applied to join a local Masonic Lodge. Early on in my Masonic education, I was urged to contemplate the hidden mysteries of science and nature through further study of the harmony between arithmetic, geometry and astronomy. Nature comprises the whole of our material universe from the solar system all the way to the smallest measurable particle of matter. Science is the disciplined use of mathematics to describe the material universe in terms of prediction and control. The process of contemplating the mysteries of science and nature is what Masons call enlightenment. As I delved further into the relationship between science and nature, I learned the venerable market trader, W.D. Gann, had been a Mason as well. Gann spent much of his trading career pursuing the study of sacred math and astrological phenomena and applying it to trading the markets. Knowing that Gann had been a Mason piqued my curiosity and my journey to learn more about the forces that affect the financial markets took on an almost urgent tone. I began to devour literature related not only to the ideas of W.D. Gann but also to esoteric mathematical patterns of science and nature.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">I soon learned, however, that my journey was to be a lonely one. Very few people in the financial industry are interested in contemplating the uncanny and esoteric patterns of science and nature, let alone astrological phenomena. In order to be accepted into the mainstream of the financial industry, one has to adhere rigidly to decades of econometric financial theory and modelling groupthink.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">As financial market investing became mainstream in the 1920s, econometric modelling was introduced to explain market behaviour. The seminal work that opened the door to decades of such modelling came in 1934 when Graham and Dodd produced </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">Security</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">Analysis</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> in which they advocated using intrinsic value as a tool that could help identify suitable investments.

<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">Because econometric models and theories underpin mainstream thinking across the financial investment industry, they also form the backbone of entire programs of study leading to the MBA degree and the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation. While graduates of these programs may feel empowered and ready to take on the financial world, they do not realize they have largely consumed a concentrated diet of economic theory during their course of study.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">In 2005, driven by curiosity, I embarked on the CFA journey but to no surprise quickly grew weary of the flaws I perceived in the theories being advanced to explain market movements. I found it difficult to embrace theories that purported to predict future stock prices based on enterprise value, earnings data or cash flow. I likewise found it hard to accept that complex credit default swaps and asset backed obligation instruments were being hailed as proper investment strategies complete with predictive models.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">In 2008, the ‘theoryland’ crowd was given a long overdue wakeup call when financial markets around the globe convulsed and major indices plunged.

Orell’s books are a reminder that our desire to cling to theory is part of a centuries-old impulse to see the world in simple, elegant terms.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">Despite some hopeful signs of change and the hard work of authors like David Orell to painstakingly expose flaws in econometric models, I find it disheartening that the financial industry continues to cling to narrow theories when it is obvious that many of the causes of events in our world are intangible and cannot be seen, felt or heard. We know that tides at the seashore rise and fall. Try as we may, we can never see or feel the actual force that moves the water. We know that earthquakes and volcanos can cause tremendous damage. Yet, we are unable to see the shifting tectonic plates deep in the Earth’s crust that cause these events. Scientists have now explained how the gravitational pulls of Jupiter and Saturn on the Sun’s gaseous matter contribute to solar sunspot activity. Yet, we cannot readily feel their gravitational pulls. Because we are unable to physically see and feel the causes of events around us, we immediately opt for the comfort of eloquently penned explanatory theories derived from large streams of data collected over long spans of time. And so it is that individual investors entrusting their hard earned dollars to Investment Advisors and Financial Planners soon become resigned to the notion that investing in the financial markets is a weary, mind numbing, long term process overlain and interwoven with models, analyst opinions and theory.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">It need not be so.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">The financial markets are nothing more than one big psychological event ruled by the emotions of fear and hope. When market participants are fearful, they sell. When they are feeling hopeful, they buy. If intangible forces are capable of causing events like tidal motion, earthquakes, volcanos and sunspots, surely then it must be plausible that these same forces can influence the emotions of fear and hope within human beings and thereby influence buying and selling activity on the markets.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">Science tells us planet Earth is one gigantic electromagnet with poles situated north and south. The various other planets that comprise our solar system are also electromagnetic in nature and exert gravitational pulls on each other as well as on planet Earth. Science also tells us the Sun shines on our gigantic electromagnet while continually emitting high frequency waves of radiation.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">In grade school science class we all at one point played with a simple prism. We learned that by varying the angle of light being shone on the prism, we could influence the refraction of the light to produce different colors. And so it is with the Sun’s radiated energy experienced by mankind on the surface of the Earth. As the various planets orbit the Sun and make different angles with one another, the intensity of the Sun’s radiation reflecting off their surfaces varies. As a result, the intensity of the Sun’s radiation reaching Earth varies. This reasoning forms the basis for the notion that our emotions are continually changing in response to these variances. By extension of the argument, it is these changing emotions that can influence the behavior of our buying and selling patterns as we trade on the financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">As a result of my trading experiences on the markets and my esoteric research over the past decade, I have now largely divorced myself from the theories that continue to be embraced by the financial investment industry. Trading and investing have become vibrant and exciting for me. I have come to embrace astrological phenomena such as Moon phases, planetary aspects and synodic patterns. I use these phenomena and patterns in close conjunction with technical chart analysis techniques to look for trend change developments on indices, ETFs, individual stocks and commodity futures.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">For the record, I do not consider myself to be an astrologer. I use astrology only to trade the markets. I do not use astrology to counsel people or predict individual fates. My educational background includes an Engineering degree from Queen’s University in Canada and an MBA from Heriot Watt University in Scotland. As a result of my engineering bent and my Masonic contemplations, I derive great satisfaction from observing patterns of astrology</span><span>—</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">especially those that align with the financial markets. The science behind how and why astrologic patterns often align with the trend changes of the markets is deep, mysterious and elusive. These characteristics further add to the satisfaction I derive when applying astrology to the markets.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">The decision to write this book was a struggle. For quite some time I debated whether or not to even share this material with others given the skeptical looks and comments I receive when trying to explain to close associates that science and nature play a role in the behavior of financial markets. The turning point for me came in early 2012 when I attended the United Astrology Conference in New Orleans, USA where an entire curriculum track was devoted to financial astrology. Listening to the discussions in the hallways between lectures, I realized I was not alone in embracing intangible forces that move the markets. There are ever-growing numbers of traders and investors who are openly embracing the connection between financial market behavior and the intangible forces of the cosmos.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">This book introduces the reader to correlations between planetary cycles, planetary aspects, lunar phenomena and the markets. These correlations are not new. In fact, they have been known about and used successfully by traders and investors for many decades. There have been many colorful personalities over the years aside from just W.D. Gann who have employed astrology towards successful trading. In fact, some of the oldest manuscripts researched while preparing this book date back to the early 1900s. Indeed, the most enjoyable part of researching and writing this book was discovering and reading historical financial astrology books and papers found in various libraries across North America.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">The correlations you will learn about in this book should never be blindly used in a vacuum. Rather, astrology should always be used in conjunction with technical chart analysis and with the prevailing short and longer term trends of the markets. Ideally to derive maximum satisfaction from this book, you should have a comfortable grasp on the commonly used technical chart analysis techniques. As well, you should also have copies of Ephemeris Tables spanning 1900-2000 and 2000 forward. I personally use the </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">New</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">American</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">Ephemeris</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">for</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">the</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">21st</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">Century</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> and its counterpart </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">New</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">American</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">Ephemeris</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">for</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">the</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">20th</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> </span><span class="Character-Italic" xml:lang="en-CA">Century</span><span xml:lang="en-CA"> which are readily available at most bookstores.

<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span xml:lang="en-CA">After reading this book and applying some of the astrological concepts presented in it, I have no doubt you will come to view our universe in a very different, almost reverent way. I expect many of you will even seek to further your knowledge of astrology through in depth study. I hope your trading and investing activity will take on a new personal meaning as you come to view the financial markets in a different way.</span></p>
