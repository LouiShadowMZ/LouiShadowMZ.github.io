<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span>Astrology is an ancient science that describes the influence of the planets on events of nature and behaviour of mankind. This ancient science is rooted in thousands of years of observation across many civilizations.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-bullet-copy"><span>•	The ancient Sumerians, Akkadians and Babylonians between the 4</span><span class="Character-Superscript">th</span><span> and 2</span><span class="Character-Superscript">nd</span><span> centuries BC believed the affairs of mankind could be gauged by watching the motions of the stars and planets. They recorded their predictions and future indications of prosperity and calamity on clay tablets. These early recordings form the very foundations of modern day astrology.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-bullet-copy"><span>•	Ancient Egyptian artifacts show that high priests Petosiris and Necepso who lived during the reign of Ramses II were revered for their knowledge of astrology. The Egyptian culture is also thought to have developed a 12 month x 30 day recordation method for time based on the repeated appearances of constellations.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-bullet-copy"><span>•	Ancient Indian and Chinese artifacts reveal that astrology has held an esteemed place in those societies for many thousands of years.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-bullet-copy"><span>•	Hipparchus, Pythagoras and Plato are revered names from the Greek era. Historians think Pythagoras may have assigned mathematical values to the relations between celestial bodies and Plato may have offered up predictions relating celestial bodies to human fates. Hipparchus is thought to have compiled a star catalogue and in so doing was the first to popularize astrology.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-bullet-copy1"><span>•	During Roman times, astrology and divination were used for political gain with important military figures surrounding themselves with seers and diviners. Ptolemy and Valens stand out from the time of the Roman Empire as writers on astrology. In 126 AD, Ptolemy penned four books on the influence of the stars which collectively are called the </span><span class="Character-Italic">Tetrabiblos</span><span>. In 160 AD, Valens penned </span><span class="Character-Italic">Anthologies</span><span> in which he further summarized the principles of astrology.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span>But, following the conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity, in 312 AD, divination and magic became a crime according to the Church and astrology began a slow retreat to the sidelines where for the most part it remains today. However, despite this sidelining by a Church seeking to protect its authority, astrology has been used in more modern history by leading thinkers such as Galilei Galileo, Tycho Brahe, Nostradamus, Johannes Kepler, Sir Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton and Benjamin Franklin. Indeed we owe much of our current state of scientific advancement to these brave souls who refused to let astrology fade away and become a distant memory.</span></p>
<p class="Title-subhead-level"><span class="Character-Bold3">The</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="Character-Bold3">Zodiac</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span>In our solar system, the Sun is at the center. The Earth, Moon, planets and various other asteroid bodies all collectively comprise our planetary system. The various planets and other asteroid bodies rotate the 360 degrees around the Sun following a path called the ecliptic plane. Picture a gigantic band that encircles the 360 degrees of the planetary system. Divide this band into twelve equal portions of 30 degrees each and the result is what astrologers call the </span><span class="Character-Italic">zodiac</span><span>. The twelve portions of the zodiac all have names including Aries, Cancer, Leo and so on. If these names sound familiar, they should. You routinely see all twelve names in the daily horoscope section of your morning newspaper. The starting point or zero degree point of the zodiac sign Aries is deemed to be at the Spring Equinox of each year as shown in Figure 1-1.</span></p>

<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span>Astrology comes in two distinct varieties</span><span>—</span><span class="Character-Italic">geocentric</span><span> and </span><span class="Character-Italic">heliocentric</span><span>. In </span><span class="Character-Italic">geocentric</span><span> astrology, the Earth is taken to be the vantage point for observing the planets as they pass through the signs of the zodiac. Owing to the different times for the various planets to each orbit the Sun, from an astrologer’s vantage point on Earth, it appears as though from time to time certain planets make distinct angles (called </span><span class="Character-Italic">aspects</span><span>) with one another and also with the Sun. The </span><span class="Character-Italic">aspects</span><span> that are commonly used in astrology are 0, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 degrees.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span>In </span><span class="Character-Italic">heliocentric</span><span> astrology, the Sun is taken to be the vantage point and to an observer positioned on the Sun, it likewise appears as though various planets are making angles with other planets from time to time.</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span>I use both types of astrology to compliment my trading activity, but I do find I am slowly developing a preference for the heliocentric variety. This may be because it is a bit cleaner than the geocentric method, for heliocentric astrology does not worry about features such as Ascendant, Descendant, MC and IC. Most of the examples you will see throughout this book are based on </span><span class="Character-Italic">geocentric</span><span> astrology, but you will also see how </span><span class="Character-Italic">heliocentric</span><span> astrology plays a role in trading the markets too, especially when it comes to commodity futures. After reading this book, I encourage you to take a look at both methods. Like me, you will probably find that you start to develop a preference for one method over the other.</span></p>
<p class="Title-subhead-level"><span class="Character-Bold3">Ascendant,</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="Character-Bold3">Descendant,</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="Character-Bold3">MC</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="Character-Bold3">and</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="Character-Bold3">IC</span></p>
<p class="Text-body-no-indent"><span>As the Earth rotates on its axis once in every 24 hours, an observer situated on Earth will detect an apparent motion of the zodiac. Astrologers further apply four cardinal points to the zodiac, almost like the north, south, east and west points on a compass. The east point is termed the </span><span class="Character-Italic">ascendant</span><span> and is often abbreviated Asc. The west point is termed the </span><span class="Character-Italic">descendant</span><span> and is often abbreviated Dsc. The south point is termed the </span><span class="Character-Italic">Mid-Heaven</span><span> (from the Latin </span><span class="Character-Italic">Medium</span><span> </span><span class="Character-Italic">Coeli</span><span>) and is often abbreviated MC. The north point is termed the </span><span class="Character-Italic">Imum</span><span> </span><span class="Character-Italic">Coeli</span><span> (Latin for bottom of the sky) and is abbreviated IC. These cardinal points are often used when applying astrology to the markets. For example, when the New York Stock Exchange officially opened for business on May 17, 1792, it had its ascendant in Cancer, its MC in Aries, its Descendant in Capricorn and its IC in Libra.</span></p>
