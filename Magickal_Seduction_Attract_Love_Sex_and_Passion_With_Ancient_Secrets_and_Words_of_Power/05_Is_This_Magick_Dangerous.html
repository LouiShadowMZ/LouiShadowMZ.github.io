into having sex with you. Even if sex is all you want, seduction should be an
art that benefits all. If you are looking to use people resentfully, treat them
as objects and then discard them thoughtlessly, this is not the book for you.
This isn’t a moral issue, but a safety issue. Seduction magick is safe so long
as you don’t create resentment in people. If you use people and make them feel
used, they have a direct link back to you, straight through the magick. That can
hurt.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The simplest protection is at hand: Be
kind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I am not going to be moralistic, though. If
you’ve been flirting with somebody at the office for years, and want to finally
get into bed with them, this is the way. Get it done, enjoy it, and move on.
Kindly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if you use sex magick to trick somebody
who doesn’t like you into having sex, then it’s unlikely to be good sex, and
nobody will feel good in the morning. Seduction magick can be so much more
enjoyable than this.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even if you want to go off on a rampage of
casual sex – and this book can certainly help with that – you should be
respectful of those you seduce. If it’s going to be casual, don’t make promises
of a relationship or another date. There’s no need to lie. In short, seduce by
being truthful and by being yourself. The magick will do the rest.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Equally, if you end up in a relationship as
a result of this magick, and then the relationship doesn’t work out, end it
peacefully. Broken relationships can lead to hatred, anger and even murder. Do
yourself a favor by being kind to those you break up with, especially when the
seduction was magickal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you follow these simple rules, the
magick will not be dangerous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although you should be respectful,
seduction is not a state where you shape yourself to somebody else’s desires.
You will never need to beg, whine or plead to get what you want, and everybody
gets to have a good time. Real seduction comes from confidently offering the
best of yourself.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Magick will open people up, so that they
see the beauty, grace and pleasure you have to offer. You are not seeking
conquests, but offering the gift of yourself.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
