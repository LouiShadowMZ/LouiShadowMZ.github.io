worrying about pronunciation. What follows is sometimes English and partly
Latin, along with words of many other origins. Everything here can be
pronounced in many ways, depending on how you interpret Latin, your native
language and your accent. There is no correct pronunciation. I have however,
included a phonetic pronunciation beneath the words in Parenthesis. This
pronunciation will work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, where it says ‘Descendimus ab aere’,
you would pronounce this as DESK-END-IM-US  AB AIR.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many people would pronounce these words
differently. I often employ the help of a local University professor to assist
with my Latin, but even he suggests many different versions, so what follows is
not conventional or even consistent. But the pronunciation shown here has
worked for me and others, so it can be fully trusted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">More important than the pronunciation is
that way you let the words come out of your body. Let the words vibrate from
the base of your lungs, through your throat and out of your mouth as though you
are speaking them to the horizon. They should not be whispered, but allowed to
resonate in your throat as they pass out of you.</span></p>
