<h1 id="heading_08_Working_with_The_Power_0"><span lang="EN-US">Working with The Power</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you perform magick you are warned not
to Lust For Results. The reason is that when you perform a spell or ritual, you
are effectively asking for something else to do the work for you. You are
handing the task over to various spirits and powers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">当你施行魔法时，会被警告不要“渴望结果”（<span lang="EN-US">Lust For Results</span>）。原因是，当你施行咒语或仪式时，你实际上是在请求其他东西为你工作。你正在将任务交给各种灵体和力量。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you do this, you should trust them to
do the work. If you keep checking up on them, by wondering about the results,
you're showing that you don't trust the, and this can make the whole operation
fail. The spirits will do what you ask, so show your trust by letting go of
your lust for result. Feel grateful that the result will come about and that is
all you need to do.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">当你这样做的时候，你应该相信它们会完成工作。如果你不断地检查它们，怀疑结果，那就表明你不信任它们，这会使整个操作失败。灵体会按照你的要求去做，所以通过放下你对结果的渴望来显示你的信任。感激结果将会到来，这就是你需要做的全部。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although this 'handing off' is important,
and it should feel as though you've handed the difficult work over to somebody
else, you should also do as much as you can in the real world. There's little
point in performing an attraction spell if you spend the next ten evenings at
home. There's not much use in performing a love spell, if you won't come into
contact with your target.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">尽管这种“交接”很重要，并且应该让你感觉好像已经把困难的工作交给了别人，但你也应该在现实世界中尽你所能。如果你接下来的十个晚上都待在家里，那么施行吸引力咒语就没什么意义了。如果你不打算与你的目标接触，那么施行爱情咒语也没什么用。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So let go of the results </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> because the hard work is being done for you on a magickal level </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> but still do everything you can to be the most attractive and
available person you can be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">所以，放下对结果的执着——因为艰苦的工作是在魔法层面上为你完成的——但仍然要尽一切努力成为你能成为的最具吸引力和最容易接近的人。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This can be a tricky mental balancing act,
but it is the one you must master for magick to work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">这可能是一个棘手的心理平衡行为，但这是你必须掌握的，魔法才能起作用。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I helped a man recently, who had gone seven
years without having sex. He was desperate, and that makes magick difficult, because
magick works best when you have confidence. But I helped him, and he got a
date. He was so nervous that he asked me to turn up at the same caf</span>é<span lang="EN-US">, and hang around in the background to be on hand in case he needed
advice. I went, and despite my best intentions I sat nearby and watched
closely. It was amusing, but quite sad.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">我最近帮助了一个七年没有性生活的人。他非常绝望，这使得魔法难以施展，因为魔法在你有信心时效果最好。但我帮助了他，他得到了一个约会。他非常紧张，甚至叫我到同一家咖啡馆，在后台待着，以备他需要建议。我去了，尽管我本意是好的，但我坐在附近仔细观察。这很有趣，但也很可悲。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mistakes and idiosyncrasies in a person can
be endearing, but he took this a bit too far. He was not well dressed. He
actually had some food stuck in his beard. And he immediately launched into an
enraged political tirade, without asking the young woman anything about
herself. He kept smiling, which is always important, so I congratulate him for
that, but he got almost everything else wrong. I realized at this point that he
needed to read some basic books on seduction, dating and relating to people.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">一个人的错误和怪癖可能很可爱，但他做得有点过火了。他衣着不整。胡子里居然还沾着食物。他立即开始了一场愤怒的政治长篇大论，却丝毫不问那位年轻女士任何关于她自己的事情。他一直保持微笑，这总是很重要的，所以我为此祝贺他，但他几乎把其他所有事情都搞砸了。那时我意识到他需要读一些关于诱惑、约会和人际交往的基础书籍。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you suspect that this may be a problem
for you, then you should do the same. The magick is powerful, but it only works
when you are offering the best of yourself. Do not go out looking unwashed,
disheveled, drunk, angry, arrogant or standoffish.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">如果你怀疑自己可能也有这个问题，那么你也应该这样做。魔法是强大的，但只有当你展现出最好的自己时它才会起作用。不要邋遢、蓬头垢面、醉醺醺、愤怒、傲慢或冷漠地出门。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Magick is powerful and it can work seeming
miracles, but put the odds on your side by being the best that you can. This is
not selling out or deceiving people. The gift of seduction is to be a glory
that somebody else can revel in.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">魔法是强大的，它可以创造看似奇迹的事情，但是通过尽你所能来增加你的胜算。这不是出卖或欺骗他人。诱惑的礼物是成为一种荣耀，让别人可以陶醉其中。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This doesn't mean you have to lose weight,
buy new clothes and so on </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> but, you know, that stuff
always helps too.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">这并不意味着你必须减肥、买新衣服等等——但是，你知道，那些东西总是有帮助的。</p>
