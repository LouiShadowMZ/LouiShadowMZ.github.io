to Lust For Results. The reason is that when you perform a spell or ritual, you
are effectively asking for something else to do the work for you. You are
handing the task over to various spirits and powers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you do this, you should trust them to
do the work. If you keep checking up on them, by wondering about the results,
you’re showing that you don’t trust the, and this can make the whole operation
fail. The spirits will do what you ask, so show your trust by letting go of
your lust for result. Feel grateful that the result will come about and that is
all you need to do.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although this ‘handing off’ is important,
and it should feel as though you’ve handed the difficult work over to somebody
else, you should also do as much as you can in the real world. There’s little
point in performing an attraction spell if you spend the next ten evenings at
home. There’s not much use in performing a love spell, if you won’t come into
contact with your target.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So let go of the results – because the hard
work is being done for you on a magickal level – but still do everything you
can to be the most attractive and available person you can be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This can be a tricky mental balancing act,
but it is the one you must master for magick to work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I helped a man recently, who had gone seven
years without having sex. He was desperate, and that makes magick difficult,
because magick works best when you have confidence. But I helped him, and he
got a date. He was so nervous that he asked me to turn up at the same café, and
hang around in the background to be on hand in case he needed advice. I went,
and despite my best intentions I sat nearby and watched closely. It was
amusing, but quite sad.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mistakes and idiosyncrasies in a person can
be endearing, but he took this a bit too far. He was not well dressed. He
actually had some food stuck in his beard. And he immediately launched into an
enraged political tirade, without asking the young woman anything about
herself. He kept smiling, which is always important, so I congratulate him for
that, but he got almost everything else wrong. I realized at this point that he
needed to read some basic books on seduction, dating and relating to people.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you suspect that this may be a problem
for you, then you should do the same. The magick is powerful, but it only works
when you are offering the best of yourself. Do not go out looking unwashed,
disheveled, drunk, angry, arrogant or standoffish.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Magick is powerful and it can work seeming
miracles, but put the odds on your side by being the best that you can. This is
not selling out or deceiving people. The gift of seduction is to be a glory
that somebody else can revel in.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This doesn’t mean you have to lose weight,
buy new clothes and so on – but, you know, that stuff always helps too.</span></p>
