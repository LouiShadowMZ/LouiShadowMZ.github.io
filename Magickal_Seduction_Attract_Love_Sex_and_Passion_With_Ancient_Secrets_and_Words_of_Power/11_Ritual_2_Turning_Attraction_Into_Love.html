Attraction Into Love</span></div></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The simplicity of what follows should not
be underestimated. If you sense that somebody is attracted to you, this ritual
can turn the desire into love.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This works whether or not you have begun a
relationship already. You can use the ritual when the person in question is a
friend, a casual lover or a more serious partner. It will not work on complete
strangers, and it will not work if there is no attraction. If there is no
attraction, use other parts of the book to get to that stage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ritual is powerful. Be warned that the
results can be so powerful that they are life changing. I am with my life
partner as a result of this ritual.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Be careful what you wish for. If you are
wise, you will only use a love spell when you are sure that falling in love
will work for both of you. This spell will work on you as well, making you fall
more deeply in love than you already are.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At one point in the ritual you will call on
the angel Haniel. For that, print out or copy the following sigil, and have it
nearby. Again, it can be found on the website if required.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">http://galleryofmagick.com/images/</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img alt="Image" height="418" src="img/image005.jpg" width="418"/><br clear="ALL"/>
<span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ritual makes use of powerful spirits
that are bound by the powers of the angel Arzel. Popularized in the book known
as The Miracle of New Avatar Power, by Goef Gray-Cobb, Arzel is the key to this
ritual. Gray-Cobb’s book, although an excellent starting point for this kind of
magick, did not give enough detail on Arzel for me to get the best results. In
his book you simply call on Arzel (he even gets the pronunciation wrong) and
petition for help. There is a better way.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In all occult work, sensing a spirit’s
presence can be quite difficult, especially if you are new to magick. The
wonderful thing about Arzel is that if called in this way, you will sense a
glorious, strong and powerful presence who will bind the other spirits to do
your bidding.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First, a word on the pronunciation of
Arzel. The best pronunciation is ARZ-ALE, where ALE rhymes with ‘pale’. I often
stress that pronunciation is no blockage to magick, but with Arzel the
pronunciation is important. If you get it wrong, the magick will still work,
but the connection with Arzel will be weaker and the results more haphazard.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Make sure you have the sigil of Haniel
nearby, and begin the ritual by evoking Arzel.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is the best method for evoking Arzel
as rapidly as possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In a quiet space, sit or stand facing East,
and repeat the phrase:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">ANKAR YODE HAY VAW HAY</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Say the words out loud. They are pronounced
as written.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ankar sounds like ‘an car’.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yode sounds like Yoda without an ‘a’ at the
end.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hay sounds like, ‘Hay’ or ‘Hey’.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Vaw sounds like ‘raw’ but with a v.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Repeat this phrase until you feel that you
are beginning to relax, and that your mind is entering a trance-like state. You
don’t need to be out of your mind - just let yourself relax into a magickal
state of mind as you say these words. When you feel ready to call on Arzel- it
might take to seconds or a few minutes - say the following.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kosu
harim silah va’anafeha arz-ale.</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(KOH-SUE
HAR-IM SIL-AH VA-ANNA-FEHA ARZ-ALE)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="pt"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Say this three times. You may feel Arzel’s
presence on the first call. You may sense a bright white light, or smell the
scent of trees, or hear pleasant, calming noises. If you don’t feel much, don’t
worry - Arzel is listening. Arzel comes when called and is working for you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now say, ‘I call on thee, mighty Arzel
(ARZ-ALE), to assist me with this work of magick.’</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Say the following, replacing N. with the
name of the one you love.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">‘In the Power of the Names EH-HEH-YEH,
YEH-HO-VO-EL-OH-HEEM and YEH-HO-VO-EL-OH-AH-VAY-DAH-ASS I place this Invocation
with Sisera (SEE-SAIR-AH), genius of desire and Jazer (and JAZZ-AIR), genius
who compels love. Know that I require and command thee to bring me the love and
passion of N. Send my love into his/her heart so that s/he returns my love. Be
Thou ruled by me in the Names SHAH-DIE-ELL-KIGH and AH-DOH-NIGH-HA-AH-RETZ.’</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Stare at the sigil of Haniel.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Say the word ‘Eh’. This is the Greek vowel
eta, which sounds like the middle of the word ‘set’. It should take two or
three seconds to say this word, starting at a high pitch and ending low. Saying
this word ignites the sigil of Haniel, and switches it on, ready for use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Chant the name Haniel for a minute or so.
You may or may not sense the angel’s presence. If you do, continue with the
next part immediately. If you sense no presence, keep going for a minute and
know that Haniel can hear you. Then say:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">‘By the power of Arzel, I call on Haniel to
warm the heart of N., so that s/she feels my love and returns it a
thousandfold. I seal this command with the word ANNA-THAN-TOS. Thus time moves
on.’</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Feel a brief  Thank You, directed
towards the angel Haniel, to the spirits Jazer and Sisera, and to Arzel who has
overseen the operation. You do not need to plead and beg or act as though you
are inferior. These spirits are powerful but they came because you called, and
because it is their duty to serve those who call them. So thank them politely,
and know that they are dismissed and leaving you now to do the work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ritual is done. You can put the sigil
of Haniel away, and forget about the results you seek by keeping yourself busy
with something else. Note that the one you love may declare passion and love
within minutes or may keep the feelings secret. The wisest workers perform this
ritual every day for 11 days.</span></p>
