Come From?</span></div></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I never share magick unless I have found it
to work for myself and others. I don’t mind whether magick is ancient or
modern, so long as it works. The magick presented in this book is partly
modern, but the spirits and entities that are employed have been around for a
long time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Just about any spell or ritual you want can
be found on the Internet with a little bit of searching, but magick that works
is a little more rare.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although ancient grimoires are now easily
obtained online, most of these books leave out the important instructions for
their use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One of the tasks of modern occultists is to
illuminate the process behind the words. If you were to obtain a copy of The
Black Screech Owl, you could find some of the magickal words included in this
book. But that is all you would find. I know of several people who have tried
the instructions in that book, treating the instruction literally. The magick
does not work. However, when you unravel the secrets in the text, you find how
to actually work the magick.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">That is what I will give you here. Then
secret to making ancient magick work in the modern world.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In that sense, there is almost nothing in
this book that I have intend from scratch. But this book will communicate to
you exactly how to preform the rituals, what to think, feel and how to get the
results you want.</span></p>
