The first ritual is aimed at making passion arise in somebody. This will work
so long as you have some contact with the person. It’s not going to work on
movie stars, unless you happen to be friends with them already. It is ideal in
situations where you want a relationship with a specific person, but nothing
has happened yet. It can also be used when there is some attraction, but the
other party doesn’t seem as passionate as you want them to be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The next part of the book looks at Love
Spells. There is an extremely powerful ritual for making somebody fall in love
with you. Some people try this spell from the outset, but I recommend using
this when there is already some attraction. Ideally, use the first ritual to
ignite passion and then turn it into love. Be certain you actually want
somebody to be in love with you. If they are married, for example, do you
really want the fallout? It’s fine if you do, but go into this with your eyes
wide open. The magick works, so don’t use it casually.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The next part of the book looks at creating
a general aura of attraction around yourself. It takes the opening ritual and
modifies it so that you disturb the aura of all you meet, making them see you
as attractive. Be prepared for strong results from this, because it works fast
and it works powerfully.</span></p>
