plan. If you need to ramp up the power of your magick you can try to obtain a
small personal item from the person in question.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ideally, this would be a hair or
fingernail. If not, a thread from clothes works well. If you have to take a
paperclip from the person’s desk, that will work too, but the more personal
this item is the better. Be careful not to break laws or get caught.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For Rituals 1, you would place this
personal item under the scrap of paper. For Ritual 2, you would simply hold
onto this item. When the rituals are complete you dispose of this item by
casting it away at a crossroads.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some people also like to use a photograph
with Ritual 1. I have not included this in the main text, because I prefer to
work with imagination, but if you find it helps, place a photograph of your
target face down underneath the scrap of paper. For some, this image makes the
ritual more powerful.</span></p>
