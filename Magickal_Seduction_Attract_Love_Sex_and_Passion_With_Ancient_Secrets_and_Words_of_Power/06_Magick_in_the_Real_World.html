prestigious book launch in London. I’d broken up with a fairly long-term
girlfriend, but I was in a good place mentally and emotionally. I was neither
desperate to replace her, nor wanting to be alone. This casual confidence is a
great state of mind for seduction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I was aware that I wanted to meet new
people, and seduce new people, but rather than being desperate about it I
simply made sure I went to lots of social events. I decided to use the magick
that’s explained in this book, to make me generally more attractive to people.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For the first week, I met a lot of
interesting people, and there were a few women who seemed to be interested in
me, but I didn’t pursue it and neither did they.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the book launch I was introduced to a
woman who I will refer to only as Z, and she was the most beautiful woman I had
met at that point in my life. To my astonishment she seemed genuinely
interested in me.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was like one of those meetings in a
movie, where it’s completely obvious that the couple are about to fall in love.
I was astonished at how well it was going, because although I am not bad
looking, Z was way, way out of my league. My friends were watching in amused
awe, probably wondering when I was going to screw it up.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Out of nowhere I found myself telling Z
that she was the most beautiful woman I’d ever met, and she replied by saying
that she found me attractive. I asked her to meet me for lunch the next day,
and she agreed, immediately giving me her phone number. She then told me that
she had a boyfriend, and wasn’t sure what to do about that yet, but that she
did want to meet me. So, despite the odds, I’d attracted Z. The magick worked.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What followed is the interesting part. I
kept drinking and kept talking to her, and partly I was enjoying a massive
ego-trip. I wanted my friends to be slightly jealous and to admire me for
getting this beautiful woman interested in me. And that was my mistake. Within
an hour I was so drunk that I lost my cool, and although my memory of the
evening isn’t too clear I know that I made an idiot of myself. Before she left,
Z told me that she wasn’t going to meet me the next day.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The lesson I learned is that sometimes,
when the magick is done, you just need to leave. Often, a seduction goes so
well that you go home together and jump into bed that night. Sometimes, though,
it’s obvious that things are going to be more long-term. When that happens,
it’s a good idea to make an arrangement to meet the person in question at
another time. Once that’s done you should leave social event as soon as you
can. If you can not leave, politely excuse yourself and talk to other people
for the rest of the night. When your magick works, accept that it has worked
and then make sure you don’t ruin the power that has been put in place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Making a future date is often a good idea
anyway, if you have the patience. That way, you give the object of your
affection gets to spend a whole night thinking about you before you meet again.
There is great power in that.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even the best magick can be screwed up by
your own stupidity, impatience or over-enthusiasm. When you’ve made the date,
get out of the way and then turn up for the date. Don’t get drunk and show off.
Powerful magick wears off quite quickly if you hang around getting
unattractively drunk.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This applies even in more formal settings,
where there may be no alcohol or drugs involved. Imagine you’re at a work
conference, and you meet somebody during the lunch break and arrange to meet
for dinner. At that point, excuse yourself and get out of the way. Don’t hang
around with the person all day. Get out of there and wait until dinner. Then
you can work your magick all over again.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Magick is only ever one factor in a
situation. The magick in this book is so powerful it’s effects will shock you,
but you still need to apply the best judgment, style and grace that you can to
make it pay off.</span></p>
