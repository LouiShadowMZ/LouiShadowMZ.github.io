Passion In Another</span></div></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you know the person you want to attract,
these are the ritual instructions you need. This is the most powerful ritual in
the book.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can perform this at any time of the
month, but there are two times that are particularly powerful. If you have
limited contact with the person you are aiming to enflame, it is best to begin
the ritual on the evening of a New Moon, and perform it for five nights in a
row.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If there is already some warmth and
friendship between the two of you that seems close to being passion, then the
best time to begin is five days before a Full Moon. Perform this five nights in
a row, ending on the Full Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At one point in the ritual you will be
asked to burn three red candles. Never burn a candle unless it is safe to do
so. I don’t want to sound patronizing, but I know of several occultists who’ve
done simple candle rituals and invited disaster through fire. Candles may seem
harmless, but many homes and lives are destroyed each year by fires that
started with a candle.  Bear in mind that you are lighting a fire inside
your home. This may sound over-cautious, but it is a serious point. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In terms of economy, the best way to get
three red candles is to buy one and snap it into three pieces. Make sure each
candle is set in a holder that keeps it safe and secure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First, you need to prepare a magickal ring.
This can be copied from the following drawing. If you prefer you can print it
out - you can download this my website:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">http://galleryofmagick.com/images/</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img alt="Image" height="378" src="img/image001.jpg" width="380"/><br clear="ALL"/>
<span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you do print it out, it helps if you
draw over all the symbols yourself, with a black pen. You can use any paper,
and this doesn’t have to be an elaborate operation. Cut the circle out, and set
it aside until you actually begin the ritual.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It helps to have a small block of
Pyrite,  which can be obtained from many occult suppliers, crystal shops
and so on. It looks like this:</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img alt="Image" height="378" src="img/image002.jpg" width="326"/><br clear="ALL"/>
<span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you can not find pyrite, a small block
of any metal will work, with iron being the best. If you can not get a small
block of metal, a stone will do the job. Whatever you use, it should be small
enough to fit inside the magick circle you’ve drawn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is time for the ritual itself to begin.
Find some time and space to be alone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Bathe or shower, as though preparing to
have sex with the person you desire.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For best results, find a comfortable place
to work without any distractions. You may want to dim the lights or close the
curtains if it is daytime. If it is warm enough, and if you find it a lustful
experience, perform the ritual naked. Otherwise, dress in a way that makes you
feel attractive.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now take a fresh sheet of paper of any
kind, and tear off a small scrap. Make sure there are no straight edges – the
scrap should have a torn edge all around. On this, write the name of the person
you wish to seduce. Write the names several times, to make a circle. It should
looking something like this.</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img alt="Image" height="378" src="img/image003.jpg" width="282"/><br clear="ALL"/>
<span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place this scrap of paper face down in the
middle of the magickal ring, so that you can no longer see the written name.
Now place your Pyrite, or other heavy object, over the scrap of paper to hold
it in place. Consider that the person you are attracting is now held within the
powers of this magickal ring.</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img alt="Image" height="266" src="img/image004.jpg" width="398"/><br clear="ALL"/>
<span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ensure that three red candles are placed
nearby, but do not light them yet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Say the following words out loud.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">‘I am grateful for all that I have. I am
humble when I revel in the wonders of power.’</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As you say the first sentence take a few
moments to think of things that you are truly grateful for. This may be the
roof over your head, a movie you watched, a good cup of coffee. Don’t try to be
grand and impressive, but simply think of recent pleasures that genuinely make
you feel grateful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As you read the second sentence, you are
making a pact. You are promising that when you have the power to seduce with
magick, you will be joyously impressed and grateful for the power, but you will
not be boastful or arrogant about your abilities. Consider these thoughts as
you say the words.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you need to, say these sentences three
times, to make sure you actually feel the words.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You should light your three red candles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now comes the part of the ritual here you
summon up the power of fire, heat and passion. Say the following words out
loud, vibrating them through your throat.</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Descendimus

MOVE-EH-TOUR)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Imagine the sun. Imagine it as a vast ball
of heat and flame, but then see it shrinking, so that in moments it becomes a
star. As the sun shrinks, it moves inside your heart and resides there. Imagine
this tiny pinprick of light within your heart, containing all the massive power
and heat of the sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Don’t worry if your imagination is not
perfectly clear. All you need to do is imagine that the sun has shrunk and is
now a tiny star in your heart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You should now being to picture the person
you desire, and hear their name in your head. You can begin to masturbate at
this point, but it is not essential. Masturbation is an extremely potent way to
add energy to a working, but it requires some control because you do not want
to reach orgasm until later in the ritual. It’s your choice, but for the best
results I highly recommend masturbation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For several minutes, picture yourself with
the person you desire. Imagine sexual acts and a strong passion and desire
between the two of you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Once you feel that your lust for the person
is strong, say these words:</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Nades,
Suradis, Maniner</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(NAR-DES,
SUR-AH-DIS, MAN-IN-ERR)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As you say the words, know that you are
summoning spirits of lust. You may sense their presence upon first uttering the
words. Repeat the words two more times, and you should feel a slight change in
the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Visualize an orange-rosy light before you.
By calling the spirits, you have summoned this light.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can see an impression of this rosy
light at</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">http://galleryofmagick.com/images/</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Picture the person you want to be with
inside this rosy light, and picture yourself there as well. Imagine that you
are together, kissing, making love. When you can see this and feel the pleasure
of it, say the words:</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sader,
Prostas, Solaster</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(SAR-DER,
PROS-TAS, SOL-AST-ER)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Speak directly to these spirits of lust,
with authority, while picturing your target. Repeat these spirit names over and
over.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It’s vital that you picture yourself in
lustful situations with your target. Don’t hold back with these images. Picture
yourself doing exactly what you desire, and picture your target loving the sex.
DO NOT picture your first date, or how you plan to get together. Picture the
result, not the process. Only picture lustful sex, as though it is happening
now. If you are masturbating, take yourself close to orgasm as you picture
these lustful acts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">After a minute or two say the following
(but replace N. with the full name of your target.) Remember you are speaking
to the spirits named above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">‘Bring me N.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Enflame his/her mind and body with passion
for me and you may feed on the energy and  ecstasy of our sex to your
satisfaction.’</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you are masturbating, continue to
picture the object of your affection until you reach orgasm.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Wipe a small amount of your sexual fluids
on the scrap of paper in the center of the ring. Not too much, because you will
be doing this for five nights.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you are not masturbating (or if you are
masturbating but can’t reach orgasm), simply let the images fade away. To close
the ritual say the following words, vibrating each word through your throat.</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venerandum
ignis non timeo.</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(VEN-ER-AND-UM
IG-NIS NON TIM-EE-OH)</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Et
ignis non tollit.</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ET
IG-NIS NON TOH-LIT)</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ignis
concordiam facit.</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(IG-NIS
CONC-ORD-EE-AM FASS-IT)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Blow out the candles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ritual is over. Put your magickal
implements away where they will not be disturbed again until you need them, and
do not think about the result you are seeking. To distract yourself you should
cook, eat, sing, talk to a friend, but do not sit around wondering whether the
magick will work. The work is done, so get on with something else.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Repeat the ritual for five nights. One the
final night, let the candles burn down until they go out – but only if it is
safe to do so. Never leave then unattended.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Once the ritual is complete for the last
time, roll the scrap of paper up into a ball, then wrap that up in the magickal
paper ring you drew. Screw it all up, and bury it somewhere nearby, preferably
on your property. If you have no nearby place to bury it, there is no urgency
to get rid of it – so you don’t need to wander the streets at night looking for
a suitable place to dispose of it – but within one day find somewhere to bury
it that is not a graveyard.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you next see the target of your
ritual, act as you normally would, but visualize a veil of white light wrapping
itself around the person. Take just a few seconds to visualize this, then carry
on as normal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It will not be long before you are given a
sign that something has changed between you. The magick has worked and how you
deal with it is up to you.</span></p>
