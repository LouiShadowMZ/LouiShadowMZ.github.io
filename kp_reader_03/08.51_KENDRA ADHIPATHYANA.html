benefics, by nature, owning Kendra signs, always evil in their dasas? Do they
invariably end one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s life?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Answer: “Kendra” is a Sanskrit word. It is
also called Chatus taya and Kantaka. The sign in which the Ascendant (Lagna)
falls, the fourth sign counted from the birth sign, the seventh sign from the
ascendant (Lagna) and the 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> sign counted from the ascendant are termed Kendra signs or Kendra
houses. It may also be used with reference to the position of the sign occupied
by Moon or other planets. On such occasions, it is said that a planet is in a
Kendra to Moon or in a Kendra to any other planet. By that, it is meant that
they are conjoined with it in the same sign, or in the 4</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US">, 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> or 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> signs counted from the sign occupied by the Moon or any other
planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) The exact longitude of the Ascendant in
a sign or that of the Moon is not at all taken for calculation. But only the
sign in which the Ascendant falls is taken whether it is zero degree 1 minute
or 29 degrees 59 minutes in that sign. So also when counted from Moon or any
other planet, only the sign occupied, will be taken for judgment and not the
Bhava (the House). In most of the horoscopes, the first part of a sign may be
included in a House (or Bhava); Whether the planet is in the first part or in
the second part of the Sign and in whichever house it is, it is not at all
taken to find Kendrasthana, but only the sign in which the planet is found. For
example: There are two births. One is born in Mithuna Lagna in the 29</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> degree and the other in the 3</span><span lang="EN-US">rd</span><span lang="EN-US"> degree
in Pisces (Meena) Lagna. The former has Moon in the second degree in
Sagittarius (Dhanus), and the latter has Moon in the 25</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> degree
in Gemini (Mithuna). In the first instance, Moon is said to be in the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> Kendra even though the longitude is only 153 degrees and in the
other case, the longitude is 112 degrees and Moon is said to be in the fourth
Kendra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the first birth chart, as Gemini happens
to be the Lagna, the Kendra houses are Gemini (the First), Virgo (the Fourth),
Sagittarius (the Seventh) and Pisces (Meena the Tenth). In the second case,
Pisces the Lagna is called Lagna Kendra, Gemini the fourth, Virgo the seventh
and Sagittarius the tenth Kendra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Meridian according to one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s latitude of birth may fall in the neighbouring sign to the tenth
sign; yet the tenth sign alone should be taken as the Kendra sign. For example,
one may be born in the second degree in Cancer (Kataka Lagna) at Lucknow.
Actually, the meridian will be 24 degrees (Meena) Pisces. But, yet Mesha should
be taken as the 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> sign or otherwise called Dasama Kendra House and not Pisces (Meena)
as calculations are made, sign to sign and not house (Bhava) to house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, when one counts the
Kendrasthanas from Lagna, the Ascendant, the fourth sign, the seventh sign and
the tenth sign are the four Kendra houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Each sign has its own lord and the owners
or 1, 4, 7 and 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> houses are called as Kendra-Athi-Pathis. When one desires to assess
the nature of a planet, whether it is a benefic or a malefic by owning a Kendra
house, it is to be counted only from the Lagna and not from the Moon or any
other planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is said that Jupiter (Guru), Venus
(Sukra), the waxing Moon (Chandra) and the unafflicted Mercury (Budha) are the
natural benefics and if they happen to own either the first or the fourth or
the seventh or the tenth house, they turn out to be unfavourable in their
disposition. It is also added that if they occupy either the second or the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house, they cause untoward results and death to the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is further stressed that Jupiter and
Venus are more evil than Moon and Mercury when they own the Kendra signs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The malefics by nature, Sun (Surya), waning
Moon, Mars (Sevvai), afflicted Mercury (Budha), and Saturn by owning the Kendra
houses become auspicious and will offer desirable results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kendrathipatya Dosha refers only to one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s health and longevity, whereas it will not prove to be either
ineffective or undesirable as regards the results indicated by the houses they
own.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ascendant denotes one’s health and
longevity. Lord of the Ascendant will invariable protect the native and improve
his health and position provided he does not occupy the evil houses i.e., sixth
or eighth or twelfth. Lord of the 4</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house indicates one’s
permanent possession, one’s vehicle and one’s mother. The 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house shows the characteristics of the partner in life, the time of
marriage, and other matters indicated by the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house.
The 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house indicates one’s profession, name, fame, reputation, honour,
ancestral property, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When one does research, taking the
horoscopes of people born in Mithuna (Gemini) and in Virgo (Kanni), Mercury is
considered to be a Kendhrathipathi by owning the Kendra houses, one and four
for Gemini-born and one and ten for Virgo; Jupiter (Guru) becomes the owner of
the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> and the 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> houses to Gemini and 4</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> as well as the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> houses to Virgo. People born in Gemini generally take up a
profession indicated by Jupiter being lord of 10 and prosper, especially during
Jupiter’s Dasa. One is born in Mrigasirish a Nakshathra third pada when Gemini
was rising in the east. When he completed 22 years during Guru dasa, he
appeared for the competitive examination and passed the I.A.S. at the first
attempt itself. He got married at his age of 26 during Mercury sub-period he
had a child born in Visaka Nakshathra (Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star
in Venus sign Libra). The birth of the child coincided with his promotion.
During Mars sub-period he enjoyed another promotion and during Rahu sub-period
he had the opportunity to go overseas. Horoscopes of such favourable
experiences show that Kendrathipathya does not make a planet necessarily evil,
offering only adverse and unfortunate results, even though there are a few
instances of death during the Dasa or Bhukti of the Kendradhipathi.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many with their Ascendant in Virgo (Kanni)
having Jupiter in the 2</span><span lang="EN-US">nd</span><span lang="EN-US"> or in the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house have out-lived Jupiter Dasa. Similarly, many people born in
Aquarius (Kumba), Leo (Simha) and Scorpio (Vrischika) have Venus in the second
or in the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house. They also enjoyed satisfactorily during Venus Dasa and a few
are now running Sun Dasa, a few Moon Dasa, and a few Mars Dasa, etc. Therefore,
one need not unnecessarily entertain any fear when an astrologer repeats the
proverbial Kendrathipathya Dosha of Jupiter and Venus and says that they are
very evil and one will not survive these Dasas. They will be at a loss if they
come across with people out-living such so-called Kendrathipati</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Dasa. Dy. Prime Minister Shri Morarji Bhai Desai aged 75, Dr. A.
Lakshmanaswami Mudaliar aged 85, Sir Dr. A. Ramaswamy Mudaliar aged 85.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A person born in Aquarius Ascendant (Kumba
Lagna) and Poorvabatra Patha (Purattadhi) Nakshatra third Pada (Kumba Rasi) was
able to have his own car only when he entered into Venus Dasa (who owns the
fourth Kendra house) at his age of 52, whereas in the earlier Dasas he could
not own even a bicycle. How far Venus as Lord of four has denied him the
beneficial results which it indicates by owning the 4</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house,
is for you, to judge.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Another person born in Scorpio as Ascendant
and in Jyeshta Nakshathra third pada gets married during Venus Dasa, Jupiter
sub period (Bhukti-apahara) and Mercury sub sub-period (anthara) with a bride
born in Poorvashada Nakshathra, Lord of which is Venus. Has Venus as Lord of
seven denied him the pleasure through marriage in his Dasa? Also who is the
lord of the constellation Poorvashada in which the bride is born? Is it not
Venus? Yes, as the lord of 7, it has done its good, by offering the person a
beautiful wife born in its own star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is known that the Lord of the eighth
house is the worst evil but the exception is that the lord of 8</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house cannot be a malefic if it is also owns the Ascendant or Lagna
(Jathakchandrika) when the 8</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house indicates one’s longevity, death, etc. When such an evil can
be warded off by owning the first house, why will not Kendrathipatya Dhosha be
mitigated if a planet owning either the 4</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> or the
tenth house also happens to be the lord of the Ascendant or Lagna? We are of
strong conviction that planets owning the Ascendant and not ill-posited can
never do harm, but ever be a saviour just as a father will protect his child,
whether he is a butcher or a robber.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is also mentioned that a planet becomes
evil by owning 3</span><span lang="EN-US">rd</span><span lang="EN-US"> or 6</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> or 8</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> or 11</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house; if they have any connection with Rajayoga Athipathis either
as Lord of 9 or Lord of 10, they also will cause beneficial results in their
sub-periods, in the Dasa of the Rajayoga Athipathi. From this, one can
understand that Lord of 10 is capable of rendering the evil planets favourable.
Lord of 10 is to offer the most desirable and lucky results causing Rajayoga.
Therefore, if they own any other Kendra house they not only offer beneficial
results indicated by the 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house but also reduce the evil attributed to the results of the
other Kendra house. For example, to Gemini Lagna, Jupiter is Lord of 7 and 10.
He will invariably do good to the native in matters relating to the 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house and to a great extent modify any evil indicated by the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house, if Jupiter is not afflicted otherwise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, only when they own the houses 4
and 7 they may be considered as evil for one’s health as well as longevity and
not to the other results denoted by the 4</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> or the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.51_KENDRA ADHIPATHYANA_1"><span lang="EN-US">DOUBT 2</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I have heard people saying that the birth
of a child at an auspicious time may modify the troublesome period of the
father and bring him fortune; the favourable and the lucky period to wife will
compensate for the miserable one of the partner; marrying a girl in whose
horoscope birth of children is strongly indicated, will be advantageous for a
man of evil influence unfavourable to the begetting of children. What is your
opinion?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Answer: I differ, it is not correct to say
that the varying fortunes of the parents get modified by the birth of the
child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whatever a native is to enjoy or suffer
from, is already pre-destined, and it will run its own course. Birth of
children on a particular date is also already found in his horoscope. If one
enjoys luck only after the birth of a particular child, it is clear that
according to his own horoscope, the evil days has ended, and lucky days have
started; unless this statement is correct, he cannot have a child at the
commencement of his fortunate days. The birth of the child at the auspicious
moment and the beginning of his brilliant times are indicated in his map. If
fate is otherwise termed as, something written on the head by Brahma, then the
Creator will not be going on changing the fate as and when one elects a
propitious time to undertake any venture or by marrying or by birth of
children, etc. Once written is never erased or modified.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a person is to suffer, while his wife
has to enjoy favourable results, according to their horoscopes, each will have
the results as indicated by the planets at the time of their birth, and, one
cannot cancel the other</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s fortune or misfortune. If </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> has married </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">B</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> and </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> runs the
most unfavourable period, whereas </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">B</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> has a lucky time, and if both were to go to races and bet, </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> will be going on losing, whereas </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">B</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> will gain. The loss of </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> cannot be prevented by </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">B</span>’<span lang="EN-US">. Nor the benefits to </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">B</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> can be robbed away by the evil influence
of </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the husband</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
chart denies children and the wife</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s chart promises
many issues according to the prediction offered by an Astrologer, we have to
say that the so-called Astrologer has not understood the science of Astrology,
or there is something wrong somewhere. Anyhow, when an expert Astrologer were
to scrutinise the horoscopes, he will boldly declare that both the horoscopes
indicate birth of children or the children born, may be a "Jara
Putra" or natural children. But, to say that marrying a lady whose horoscope
promises children whereas that of her husband has no clear indication of it, is
not wise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, one's luck or ill-luck cannot be
altered or modified, by electing a propitious time for the commencement of any
venture, or by marrying one, or by birth of children, and so on. Everything is
an occurrence as predestined.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is correct to predict that a native will
go overseas at the age of 26, and he will have a child at his 25th year of age,
whereas it is not wise to say that because the native had a child at a
brilliant time at his age of 25, it is due to the luck of the child the father
had the fortune to go overseas. In the wife's chart, it will be shown that the
husband will go overseas; in the boy's chart, planet will portray that the
father will go overseas at his birth anniversary, and in his own chart, he will
find that he has to go overseas at the age of 26.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the results may be compared to that of a
flower, then the indications from each chart, may be compared to the light
thrown from the torch (horoscope). Nobody's light can change the flower to
fruit or to seed. Every light wi.l show that it is a flower. Similarly, every
horoscope will indicate the same result and never change it.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.51_KENDRA ADHIPATHYANA_2"><span lang="EN-US">DOUBT 3</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Excepting Sun and Moon, each planet is
assigned two houses. If a planet, owning two houses, occupies a particular sign
in the chart of a person, and if its dasa operates, what will be the nature of
the results enjoyed by him? Is it the result of the houses owned by the planet,
or that occupied by it? Or is it the result of the first house which it owns in
the first half of its period and that of the other house, ruled by it in the
second half? The results of which house will be favourable and which will prove
to be evil? Or will both be good or both be bad?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Answer: Sun owns the house Leo (Simha) Moon
rules Cancer (Kataka). Mars governs Aries (Mesha), and Scorpio (Vrischikam),
Mercury is assigned Gemini (Mithuna) and Virgo (Kanni), Jupiter governs
Sagittarius (Dhanus) and Pisces (Meena) Venus rules over Taurus (Rishaba) and
Libra (Thulam), and Saturn owns Capricorn (Makaram) and Aquarius (Kumba). Rahu
and Ketu are omitted by the Westerners but Hindus include them, though they
have not agreed in allotting any house for them. There is difference of opinion
about their ownership. Let us continue ourselves within these seven planets who
also rule the seven days in the week.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The owners of a house indicate the source
of certain results, as each house governs certain affairs. So, it is necessary
to note for what houses counted from the ascendant, the planet in question is
the lord, whichever house it may accidentally occupy, at the time of the birth
of the native. For example, to Vrischika Lagna, Saturn is the lord of the third
and the fourth houses, and whatever may be the house it occupies, Saturn has,
by its lordship, the strength to give the results through the sources signified
by the third and the fourth houses (i.e. brothers and mother; short journeys
and permanent place of residence; communication and transport respectively).
The same Saturn if it is in its own constellation to Mithuna Lagna-Gemini
Ascendant, will be the lord of the 8th and 9th houses, and so Saturn as lord of
8th indicates mental worries, difficulties, sickness and mode of death whereas
lord of 9 it shows Father (according to Hindus which, is to be followed),
higher education, long journey, overseas, etc. In the case of Scorpio or
Vrischika Lagna Saturn in its own constellation shows gain or loss, through
brother as lord of 3, and through mother as lord of 4. To Gemini-borns gain or
loss through father as lord 9, and through insurance, bonus, gratuity, legacy,
etc., as lord of 8 are indicated. Also friendship or enmity with such a
relative, is indicated by lordship. Favourable or unfavourable results are to
be judged by the house which it occupies. Here, the question is whether it is
favourable to the native of the chart or adverse to him; and also to the
matters or relatives indicated by the houses owned by the planet? One is to
note the various houses owned by a planet and include this also into account
while interpreting the results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The results of the house occupied by a
planet will be indicated more by the planet which occupies the house, than by
that which owns the house. In giving the results of a house, the planet
occupying it is considered as the strongest. The owner is taken as next only in
strength. The results of the house occupied by the planet will get modified by
the planet which aspects it, and also by the planet which is conjoined with the
lord and which aspects the lord of the house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a planet occupies a sign which is the
6th or the 8th or the 12th from the sign which it owns, it loses strength to
offer such results as are indicated by that house, but will give results just
opposite to the indications of the house owned by it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. If the 6th house indicates dispute and
drain of purse, the 6th therefrom shows harmony, friendship and profit which is
the 11th from the ascendant. if the 8th house denotes obstacles, hindrance and
difficulties, the 8th to the eighth denotes "Sahaya", assistance and
courage. If the 12th house shows loss the 12th to the 12th house shows gains,
by that, it may be observed that planets occupying a sign which is 6 or 8 or 12
to what it owns, will offer results opposite to what they indicate by ownership.
Lord of 1 shows health. If he occupies the 6th house, it indicates ill-health
to the native. If it occupies the 8th longevity is not much promised. If it is
12, he will spend away whatever he has, and the planet does not allow him to
continue to live in his own place and keep up the bank position.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. The occupant is stronger than the owner
of the sign:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">a. only when the lord of the sign does not
gain more strength by occupying its exalted sign or by being Vargothama,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">b. when the lord of the sign is not
conjoined with the planet or is occupying its other sign, and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">c. when the occupant is exalted, whether
the owner is in its own sign, or exaltation or Vargothamamsa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. The occupant is weaker than the owner:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">a. if the occupant is in its enemy's camp
or neecha, i.e., debilitated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">b. If the lord of the sign is exalted and
the occupant is not,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">c. If the lord of the sign is conjoined
with the planet in its own sign and the occupant is not exalted there i.e., the
owner is in swakshethra, whereas the occupant is neither exalted nor Vargothama
there.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For example, if Moon and Jupiter are
conjoined in cancer (Katikam), moon, even though it is in its own sign, yet the
exalted Jupiter is stronger in giving the results (in its period) indicated by
the house Cancer (Katikam) than what Moon can do in its period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars and Moon conjoined in Cancer denote
that Moon is stronger.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon's exaltation in Taurus (Rishaba) and
Jupiter exalted in Cancer (Kataka) and Venus exalted in Pisces (Meena) in a
horoscope, indicate that Jupiter, the tenant, will give the results of the
house Cancer in his period, much more than Moon who rules Cancer; the results
indicated by Taurus to that native will be offered by Moon, as he occupies, to
a greater extent, in its period, than Venus, the lord of the Sign; Venus
bestows on him the results indicated by Pisces (Meena) to a greater extent,
that Jupiter who owns the house, in Venus periods, than what he enjoys in
Jupiter's periods and sub-periods. That is, if the strength of the planets
remains more or less the same by their, occupation, then the occupant is really
stronger than the owner in offering the results of the house to that person,
whenever its periods and sub-periods operate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The results of the house given by the
planet occupying a house will be modified by its nature, ownership of the
house, and other connections, like conjunction with, or aspect from other
planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Nature of the planet: If lord of 3 is in 11
and its period is running, then he will gain (11th house) through his brother
(3rd house). If the owner of the third house is Saturn, then the brother who
helps him will be economical and calculative (nature of Saturn), whereas if the
third house is ruled by Mars, the help will be received with pleasant surprise
and the brother will be extravagant, and over-liberal (nature of Mars). Jupiter
as lord of 2 in 11 indicates gains by lawful means (nature of Jupiter), whereas
Saturn as lord of 2 in 11, may give profit by fair or foul means (nature of
Saturn). So, the nature of the planer also should be included when one
interprets the results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ownership of various houses: Again the
ownership of a house suggests, through which source he will have the gain or
loss. If lord of 5 in 11, one can predict that at the time he runs the period
of the lord of the 5th house who is in 11, the person will have the gains
through speculation or cinema or pleasurable pursuits or through children, as
these are indicated by the 5th house. So, the occupant offers the results of
the house it occupies including the above indication.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us see how the results of the house it
owns, will improve or get destroyed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is either weaker or stronger than the
planet, occupying its house, or if there is no planet in its house then one is
to note the relative disposition between this planet and the houses it owns. If
it is not in 6 or 8 or 12 from the house which it owns, it will give the
results of the house in the manner which the house indicates. But if it
occupies a sign 6 or 8 or 12 from the house it owns, the planet will give
adverse results to the matters indicated by the house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose one's Lagna is Scorpio (Vrischika)
and Saturn, the lord of the third and the fourth houses, occupies the 11th
house Kanni (Virgo), then the matters indicated by the third house, will
flourish, as it is in the ninth from the third house, and it is a very
favourable disposition. But during the period of Saturn the matters indicated
by the fourth house will suffer. Fourth house indicates mother, the eighth from
it is the 11th house. So, mother will have difficulties and worries though the
native will gain then through brother. The native may study in a school and he
may receive a letter from the mother that she is ill, and also money order
remitted by her, whereas the younger brother may write saying, that he has got
a seat in the college for higher studies, or that he is selected to go
overseas. Here the mother will send money and not brother, because it is only
to the fourth house, the 11th house happens to be the eighth. But to the third
house, it is the ninth. His purse cannot be drained. Brother and correspondence
(indicated by the third house) give him pleasure, (shown by the 11th house).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, one having lord of 3 in 11, may
have gains through editing, publishing, publicity, correspondence, or working
as a sales representative, agent, or by making short journeys or through
youngsters and neighbours. Further the third house results also will thrive,
and brother will have prosperity. But the lord of the fourth house, while
occupying the 11th house, is in the 8th from its own. In such cases, the
native, no doubt, will gain through the 4th house matters i.e., he may gain
through permanent possessions, through mother (according to Hindus, which alone
is to be followed) and also by dealing in vehicles, etc., or through produce of
mine. But mother's health will be affected and her mind will be disturbed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, Saturn as lord of 6 and 7
occupying the 11th house shows that he may come out successful in the
litigation, which will end in that planet's sub-period, whereas his partner may
have a child born at that time, as 11th house is the 5th from the 7th.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore one has to note whether the
planet which occupies a beneficial house in the chart, is in the 6th or the 8th
or the 12th from the house which it owns or occupies a favourable position from
its house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the house occupied happens to be 6 or 8
or 12 from the house which it rules, the indications of the house which it
governs, will turn contrary; otherwise-through the matters indicated by the
other house the native will gain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the house occupied is favourable to one
of the houses owned by the occupant, and unfavourable to the other, then, not
only will he gain through the house to which the planet is in a favourable
position, but also the results of the house, owned by the planet, will prosper.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if the house occupied is unfavourable
to its own house, the results of the house owned will suffer, deteriorate and
the relatives, indicated by that house, will undergo difficulties, when the
native runs the period of the planet. These results will not operate throughout
one's lifetime. They can be enjoyed only when its period runs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the planet may be compared to a light,
the house it occupies to that of a coloured slide (the colour depending on the
house), then, the extent of the result will depend on the strength of the
planet, and the source of the result will be indicated by both the houses which
it owns, and its Karakathvam, i.e., certain matters and events of which the
planet is the chief governor.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The nature of the result will depend on the
house it occupies. As per Krishnamurthi Padhdhati, the nature depends mainly on
the lord of the constellation. The occupation will show gain or loss, whereas
the house owned shows the source. It is similar to the light which illuminates
the slide, and throws that colour of the slide, indicating the house occupied.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">House - Vacant: If a house is not occupied
at all, then the owner of the house, the planets aspecting the house, indicate
the results of the house. They will get modified by the planets which conjoin
or aspect the lord of the house. According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, planets
in the constellation of the lord of the house will bestow the matters signified
by that vacant house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="554" src="img/image079.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A father is born in Virgo Ascendant (Kanni
Lagna) and he runs Sani Dasa (Saturn's period). His Nakshatra is Chithra 1st
pada, and Moon occupies the Ascendant. at the time of birth, Saturn was in
Aries and in the 8th house. In this instance, one is to interpret as follows:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn owns Capricorn and it is the 5th
house from the Lagna, Virgo. By occupying Aries, it squares the 5th house.
(Various authors have declared that planets, evil by nature occupying the 4th
or the 8th house, spoil the results of the house and will do harm to that
native). Hence, difficulties experienced by the person, will be related to, and
signified by, the 5th house. Thus he loses in games and incurs loss through his
children, especially the first issue. His son will not keep mental equilibrium
and good health. He will be worried about his self-acquisition. (Saturn also
owns the second from the 5th house). Saturn as lord of 6 in the 8th, forms
favourable aspect with its house from the 8th, and hence he will have to raise
loan, and he will not find it difficult to do so, as the disposition is
favourable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a planet owns both the house of profit
and that of loss in its period, during the sub-period of beneficial planets, he
will then gain, and during the sub-period of the evil planets, he will lose.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some divide the period into two halves, and
predict that, during the first half of the period, the planet will be giving
such results as are indicated by the house which is nearer to the ascendant,
counting the houses from lagna, 1, 2, 3 and so on and the second half of the
period will indicate the results governed by the other house. For example, if
Jupiter owns the 5th and the 8th houses to the ascendant Leo (Simha), it is
incorrect to foresee that the first half of Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
period will be good, because it will be the results of the 5th house,
Dhanus-Sagittarius, and the second half of the period will be harmful, as it is
the effect of the 8th house Pisces. Actually, he has not enjoyed anything
during the first half of Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s period, except
during Mercury sub-period. Whereas Venus, Moon and Rahu sub-periods, covering
most of the second half of Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Dasa, proved to be
very auspicious, by giving marriage, promotion, children, voyage with family to
foreign land and satisfactory increase in income, by keeping him in good cheer,
and by making him feel jubilant, buoyant, and contented.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some are of the opinion that the beneficial
effects which result by owning a favourable house, will get cancelled, as it
owns the unfavourable one also. This statement is not correct. He will have
both the results experienced. He will gain through one source and also lose
through the other source. In his ledger, he should have two entries, one
crediting to his account and another debiting him. It will not pass on without
giving both the results. The ultimate balance sheet may show zero. If one house
denotes health, and the other house threatens accident, during its period, and
the sub-period of an evil planet, he will meet with an accident and have some
injuries and during the sub-period of a beneficial planet, he will have the
cure and maintain good health. The good results of a house will not get
cancelled by the evil results of the bad house, if a planet owns both the
houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Malefics in 4, 6, 8 and 12 to any house,
will destroy the indications of the house, whereas planets in other houses,
improve the matters of the house.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.51_KENDRA ADHIPATHYANA_3"><span lang="EN-US">DOUBT 4</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Will a native born at a time, having Raja
yoga in his horoscope, enjoy the yoga results throughout his life? Does the
Raja yoga promise no difficulties to him and will he lead a princely and
aristocratic life throughout?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Answer: Hindus alone judge the prosperity
of a horoscope considering the various yogas present in it. The ancient Hindu
astrologers have mentioned (a) certain combinations of planets, or (b) lords of
certain houses, or (c) the relative disposition of a planet to the ascendant,
or to the Moon are termed as Rajayogas, and such combinations will produce most
brilliant results. Those who are born in the royal family will become Emperors
and those born in the middle class family will attain power, be popular and
prosperous, enjoying all the fruits of life in this world.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is regrettable that the readings given
by a few of the present astrologers who reproduce the slokas relating to the
yoga, without considering whether or not all, the conditions mentioned therein
fit in with the charts they have taken for reading, and have translated those
slokas only which are pleasing to the consultant at the time of going through
them, and do not mention about the unpleasant things indicated therein. But the
beneficial results predicted do not come to pass. People, having similar combinations
of planets, will be quoted by these astrologers, to arouse confidence in the
minds of the consultant, without going into greater detail as to why, in their
cases, events came true, while in the case of the querist, similar favourable
results have not come about in spite of strong planetary combinations,
indicating Rajayoga and the other planets occupying different houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There are a few important facts which are
to be taken into consideration. A thorough study is needed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. One should note circumstances,
environments and surroundings, under which a native is born.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Whether in his life time, he runs the
Dasa of the planets which cause Rajayoga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Whether there are planets in 6 or 8 or
12 to the planet producing Rajayoga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Whether the planet causing Rajayoga is
conjoined with Nodes, Rahu or Ketu or with lords of 6, 8 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Whether Rahu or Ketu occupies the sign
owned by the planet which produces Rajayoga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Whether he will live to the age at which
the mutual dasas and bhuktis of the planets, producing Rajayoga will operate,
and lord of 6 or 8 or 12 is not conjoined with them; or majority of planets are
not in 6 or 8 or 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. Whether the planet producing Rajayoga is
not in the constellation (nakshathra) of the lords of 6 or 8 or 12, to them or
in their sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is said that person who has Rajayoga by
the combination of a few planets, will have the following results</span>–</p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">The person who has his birth in Rajayoga
will be a king who will be accompanied by elephants, horses, litters,
palanquins and the like, the roaring of the kettle drums and the sounds of the
conch shell with a circular umbrella made of soft woolen cloth, held over him,
praised by bards and minstrel, and solicited by eminent men with various kinds
of presents in their hands. The person will enjoy all comforts in the company
of many beautiful damsels</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Honestly, the majority of these can be
noticed, when some people, belonging to a few Indian communities, pass away and
use such drums and conch shells, umbrella, palanquin, or cot, etc. But one
should consider how many can become kings, though not of a country, yet at
least at home, where normally they can be. How long can they continue to be so?
And in a country where brothel is more or less eradicated, how can one be in
the company of many damsels. Has he no other work?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The astrologer has to consider the
limitations and then assess the extent to which the combination can do good to
the native. If he were to interpret correctly, in the majority of the cases,
where the other planets are not strong, and very favourably posited, but only
this yoga exists, he can predict that the native will get over all the
difficulties he had suffered from the time, the Rajayoga planet commences to
operate and during its period he will be able to realise his ambition and
fulfil his desire. He may enjoy desirable results, and look forward to a
satisfactory advancement in his life. The percentage of improvement may be
common to those, having the same Rajayoga, but the extent of its enjoyment will
vary according to the environments in which he is born. A person, worth a
million, may be having a lakh as profit for a year, whereas, another with a
similar planetary combination born at the same time, in a middle class family,
can have a few thousands or hundreds a year. The swelling in the little finger,
due to witlow, will be proportionately less than the swelling in the thumb,
when the witlow affects the thumb.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. A person may not see the bright days at
all in his life time, and pass away, if he does not run the period of the
planets which cause such a Rajayoga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Planets in 6, 8 or 12 to the planet
producing Rajayoga, will destroy the beneficial results in their sub-periods in
the dasa of the Rajayoga planet and in their periods the Rajayoga results will
be absolutely absent. (Vipareetha Rajayoga is exempted).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Rahu or Ketu, in conjunction with any
planet, will give the result of the planet, in their periods, whereas the
planet gets much weakened, and the results offered by the planet will,
accordingly, be moderate. If one can compare Rahu or Ketu to water, and the
planet to milk, then the combination of the node with the planet, may be
compared to mixing water with milk, when water gets the name milk, and also
fetches a price. Therefore, those planets, which cause Rajayoga by being the
lord of a house should not be conjoined with either of the nodes, Rahu or Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Generally, the results of a house and
those of the lord of the house, are given by the planet occupying the
constellation of the owner or the tenant. Of all the occupants, the nodes, Rahu
and Ketu are the strongest. Hence, if Rahu or Ketu were to be in the house
which is owned by the planet, producing Rajayoga, then one can expect such
results mostly during the period of the node and in the period of the planets
in the constellation of the node and it will not be enjoyed in the period of
the planet to one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s satisfaction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Lords of 6 or 8 or 12, conjoined with
planets producing Rajayoga will rob away the beneficial results of the yoga
adhipathis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take, for example, one who is born
with Aries as his ascendant, and Moon and Mars posited in Kumbha (Aquarius).
The combination of Moon and Mars termed as Chandramangala yoga, has to produce
favourable results to him. It will not be correct to argue that this native
will become an engineer and will amass wealth due to this yoga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">An astrologer should first note the
nakshatra in which he is born, what dasa he has at the time of birth, and what
dasas follow. Next, he has to find out in what age, he will enter into the dasa
of the yoga-producing planets. In this case, even if one born with Moon in the
first degree of Kumbha of Aquarius, he can enjoy the period of Mars to a
maximum of 3 </span>½<span lang="EN-US"> years during his life time: then he can
have Moon dasa only after 96 </span>¼<span lang="EN-US"> years of his age. If one
would have been born when Moon was at the 30th degree of Kumbha (Aquarius),
then he would have had 4 years of Jupiter dasa to start with and only at the
age of 69, he will enter into Moon dasa. Therefore this, native would not have
become an engineer or earned and saved money as an engineer, because of Moon/Mars
combination. A yoga caused by two planets will be enjoyed only when their
periods operate in one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s lifetime.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If there is a Rajayoga in a person</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s chart, it does not guarantee that he will never suffer in his
life, and that he will ever prosper.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.51_KENDRA ADHIPATHYANA_4"><span lang="EN-US">DOUBT 5</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">SWA BHUKTI</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I am, at present, running Saturn dasa Venus

finding out the beneficial sub-periods and also the adverse ones.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Have your horoscope correctly cast.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Have a dasa-bhukti reference table in
which the period of Saturn bhukti running for three years and three days is
sub-divided and let the duration of each antara of sub sub-period be also
calculated and submitted for your use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. From your diary, note down in which
antara (sub sub-period) you had fortune and in which antara you had
disagreeable results. Similar results alone will repeat when their bhukties
operate for longer periods.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose, you entered Saturn dasa on
10-3-1956. The first sub-period, otherwise called bhukti or apahara, is ruled
by Saturn, the dasa lord himself, for 3 years and 3 days from 10-3-56. So, from
10-3-56, you had Saturn dasa, Saturn bhukti. Then, for 2 years 8 months and 9
days from 13-3-59 to 22-11-61 Saturn dasa, Mercury bhukti operated. For 1 year
1 month and 9 days from 22-11-61 to 1-1-63, Saturn dasa Ketu bhukti had been

13-3-59</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note all the events between 10-3-56 and
13-3-59. Suppose you had promotion in January, 1957, it was in the fag end of
Mercury sub sub-period. Therefore, during Saturn dasa, Mercury sub-period (or
bhukti) which ran between 13-3-59 and 22-11-61, in the last portion, you ought
to have been promoted. If during Saturn dasa, Saturn bhukti, Ketu anthra,
running between 4-2-57 and 8-4-57, if any of your close relatives had passed an
anxious time, then mostly the same person or a similar relative will again cause
anxiety during Saturn dasa, Ketu bhukti in between 22-11-61 and 1-1-63. If
during Venus sub sub-period between 8-4-57 and 8-10-57 you had your wedding,
during Venus Bhukti, between 1-1-63 and 1-3-66, you will lead a happy and
harmonious life with your wife. Or, if you had fallen in love in the middle of
1957, then in Venus bhukti, it will be intimate and marriage will take place.
If during the next sub sup-period of Sun between 8-10-57 and 2-12-57 you were
transferred to a mining department, then during Sun bhukti, you will surely
have a decent promotion in such a department. If during Moon</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sub-sub period, your younger sister got married, then during Moon
bhukti, between 13-2-67 and 13-9-68, she will lead a pleasant life and she may
give birth to a child. If during Mars sub-sub period, between 3-3-58 and 6-5-58
you purchased a plot of land with the idea of constructing a house at a later
date, you will surely build one during Mars bhukti, between 13-9-68 and
22-10-69. If Saturn dasa, Saturn bhukti, Rahu antara, caused you trouble
through eczema; you can look for similar troubles in Saturn dasa, Rahu bhukti,
between 22-10-69 and 28-8-72. If you had a child in Saturn dasa; Saturn bhukti,
Jupiter antara, between 18-10-58 and 13-3-59, the child will be fortunate when
you run Saturn dasa, Jupiter bhukti between 28-8-72 and 10-3-75.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.51_KENDRA ADHIPATHYANA_5"><span lang="EN-US">Will it be correct</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Why not? Any event in your life is
indicated by the relative position between two planets, or one planet and the
cusp of a house. They are the significators and they indicate the results. Such
occurrences will happen to you whenever those planets jointly rule your time.
Similar ones will repeat whenever their periods again and again operate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is the simplest and most accurate
method of finding out how the dasa will be, provided your horoscope is correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There are many general rules. They should
not be strictly applied. Modifications are many. They are to be included.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When a particular dasa runs for many years,
during that period, by transit, all the planets move in many signs and houses.
They will indicate separately some results. By progression, Moon will be
forming various aspects. Other planets also will form some aspects. They will
only confirm the results obtained by following the simplest method suggested by
me. There will never be a contradictory indication. They will agree. That is
the wonder of vimshodhari system.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose one runs Saturn dasa, Saturn bhukti
and Saturn transits in the 8th house, or happens to be ardhaashtama (the 4th),
or there is seven and a half years Saturn otherwise called sade-sati one should
not conclude that the time is evil and the person will suffer. There are
various other aspects to be taken for consideration before passing a judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For beginners my suggestion is the best,
fairly accurate and the simplest.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">An author has said that if a planet were to
offer Rajayoga result and has also to cause Maraka, it gives the yoga first and
then alone death. By that, the author means that the Rajayoga planet is your
strong benefic and hence it allows you to enjoy the fruits of this life to your
satisfaction and then alone, it will do harm to your life. Even in law, there
are many rules. The spirit of the law is to be properly understood. One has to
apply it properly and be practical. Analytical study, correct intuition and
good judgement are needed for successful astrologers. Good astrologers will
have in their horoscopes strong and favourable Mercury conferring all the
qualities of a good astrologer. Moon-natives, devoid of beneficial aspects from
Mercury, cannot become scientific astrologers. Moon may be compared to a mirror
and Mercury to a lens. Moon can simply reproduce those which are committed to
memory, just as a mirror shows the image of the object without any alteration
or improvement. But a lens is different. So also, unlike Moon, Mercury gives
sharp intelligence, thorough study, practical application and correct judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Read the results given by sages for the
sub-periods of Jupiter in Jupiter dasa, Mercury bhukti in Mercury dasa, Venus
bhukti in Venus dasa, and so on. All the authors give pleasant results. Why?
They are natural benefics. For you, Saturn, by ownership becomes a benefic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, note down whether the entire
period of two years, one month and eighteen days of Jupiter bhukti, in Jupiter
dasa was good. No. only certain sub-sub-periods in Jupiter bhukti would have
been favourable while a few might have been troublesome. Yet, on the whole, it
will be good. If you observe, you will understand that the antaras of those
planets which were good in Jupiter bhukti, will prove to be very beneficial to
a great extent when their bhuktis in Jupiter dasa operate. Similarly, the
adverse antaras of the few planets will be undesirable during their bhuktis to
a great extent.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A thorough study of Dasa system,
progression and annual horoscope are needed to pass correct judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As proper and exhaustive, explanation is
needed and each may cover many pages, separate books on </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Dasa Phala Nirnayam</span>”<span lang="EN-US">, </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Progression</span>”<span lang="EN-US">, </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Annual
