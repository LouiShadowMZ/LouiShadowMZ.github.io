member is added to the family which is indicated by the second house. This
addition is an agreement which is denoted by the seventh house and such an
additional member brings permanent tie of friendship for pleasure and progeny,
shown by the 11th house. That is why houses 2, 7 and 11 are examined to find
out whether:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) marriage is promised or not;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) the description of the partner, his or
her ruling planets, whether already related or not; his or her features,
characteristics, profession, etc.;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) time of marriage; and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) state of married life; (1) whether it
is a harmonious one promising an inseparable temperament or (2) the couple
without any attachment, simply to maintain the prestige of the family, manage
to live in the same premises or (3) to lead the life like cat and rats,
especially during daytime even though the couple may become the parents of many
children or (4) to be going on marrying and divorcing.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.22_TIME OF MARRIAGE _K.P_1"><span lang="EN-US">Is the marriage promised or not</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Marriage is celebrated in youth or in

favourable houses and receive good aspects from other planets;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(z) Or a benefic is transiting very close
to the Ascendant or 7th Cusp at the time of birth in the 12th house or 6th
house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is arranged marriage, the parents may
or may not take much pains to find out the bridegroom, if it s a love marriage;
then also, the couple may or may not take a long time to give expression to
their love to celebrate it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following chart is that of a girl who
got married at the age of 12, her birth was on 29-6-1926 at 19 Gathis. 45
Vikathis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="565" src="img/image045.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Balance of Mars dasa 2 years, 10 months and
19 days. The date of marriage was 11-7-1938, on a Monday in Moolam star. She
was running Rahu dasa Mercury Bhukti Moon Anthra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Lagna is weak as its lord is in the 8th
house and the Lagna is occupied by Saturn. Moon sign is stronger as it is
conjoined with the benefic, Jupiter and the lord of the rasi is in the 9th sign
in exaltation. Hence Moon sign is stronger.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second house is occupied by Mars. Its stars
are Mrigasirish a, Chitra and Dhanishta. No planet is in Mrigasirish a, none in
Chithrai but Moon and Jupiter are in star Dhanishta. Both of them are
significators. i.e. Moon and Jupiter, Mars by occupying the second house is
next in strength.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house is occupied by Ketu. Its stars
are Aswini, Makam and Moolam. No planet is found in any of these three stars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7th house is vacant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 2 and 11 is Jupiter. Its stars are
Punarvasu. Visakam and Poorvapathra-Rahu was in Punarvasu: Sani in Visaka and
none in Poorvapathra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence Rahu and Sani are also significators
of the two. Rahu is conjoined with Sun, the lord of 7. So Rahu has greater
influence. Sun, the lord of 7, rules Karthikai, Uthrapalguni and Uthrashada.
Venus alone was in Karthikai. As Sun conjoined with Rahu get weakened, Venus
also will be offering the results of the 7th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence Moon, Jupiter, Rahu, Saturn and Ketu
are the significators, Mercury in the constellation of Saturn, and aspected by
Saturn, is also auspicious. It gains strength to give marriage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A node, conjoined with a planet gives the
results of the planet. As Sun rules the 7th house, Rahu is to bless her with
marriage since Rahu is conjoined with Sun. Further, it is under the sway of
Jupiter, lord of 2 and 11, counted from the Moon sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn in Lagna cause delay in marriage. It
can, till its period is over. Even though Budha is aspected by Sani according
to Hindu method by the 10th aspect, yet they are 108</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
away and form good aspect. If it were to be 90</span>°<span lang="EN-US">,
Mercury cannot give the wedding. Being 108</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> away,
Mercury will be helpful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To dasanatha Rahu, Mercury is, in advance,
in the second house. Therefore Rahu Dasa Mercury Bhukti was the period of
marriage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Moon and Jupiter in close conjunction
is auspicious for early marriage;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Moon and Jupiter in 5 to Lagna is
favourable to celebrate the marriage in youth,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Venus, lord of Lagna and Mars, lord of
7, are in 3 and 11 to each other.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This horoscope is illustrated to show that
very early marriage can take place, even though exalted Saturn was in the
ascendant as Jupiter by its aspect to Saturn reduces its malefic results and
the conjunction of Moon and Jupiter is very beneficial.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Marriage is promised but it comes off late
in life:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) If Saturn is either in 1, 3, 5 or 7 or
10 counted from Lagna or Moon sign and if he does not own beneficial houses;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) If malefics are in the 7th Bhava,
receiving adverse aspects from Jupiter or Uranus;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) If Mars is in the 8th house;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) If Moon and Saturn conjoin together
especially in 1, 2, 7 or 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) If Mars and Venus are conjoined
together in 5, 7 or 9 and both receive evil aspects from Jupiter or Uranus;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) If the lord of 7 and Venus are aspected
by Saturn;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) If Moon and Venus are squared by
Jupiter or Uranus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There will be many proposals, one after
another they will fall through and years will pass on. The parents and the
bride will get so much dejected and vexed that the bride decides to remain
unmarried. But at last, a fresh negotiation will come up with a new party and
the marriage will be fixed and celebrated suddenly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following ones are the charts of two
individuals; one male and another female and both are to be married.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Born on 2-4-1926 Friday at 39G, 40 V, in
Anuradha star with a balance of Saturn dasa for 9 years 11 months and 27 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn is not a Rajayogathipathi, nor does
he own the rasi.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the chart of the boy -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second house is occupied by Ketu and it
delays marriage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lords of 2 and 11 are in debilitation.
Venus lord of 7, in 4 will offer the marriage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon and Jupiter forming favourable aspect,
will on a later date settle a family life on you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="542" src="img/image046.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn dasa balance 9y 11m 27 d</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="526" src="img/image047.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon dasa balance 2y 6m 19 d.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, Venus Dasa, Moon Bhukti, Jupiter
Anthra will give the marriage at the end January 1965 itself.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the Girl's horoscope</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Evil node in 7 shows delay (Rahu);</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Mars in 8 shows hindrances and
obstacles;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Saturn aspects the 11th house;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Moon in Capricorn is afflicted by
Saturn, the relative position between the two being 22 1/2 degrees.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The above are the indications showing that
the marriage will be accomplished with great difficulty.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The time of marriage will be during Jupiter
Dasa, Jupiter Bhukti, Rahu Anthra on or around 14th July, 1965. Actually the
marriage was fixed in June and celebrated on 14-7-1965.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.22_TIME OF MARRIAGE _K.P_2"><span lang="EN-US">LONGEVITY OF PARTNERSHIP</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A gentleman who is the partner of a firm
asked the longevity of his partnership. The relationship with partners were
going from bad to worse day by day. The querist gave Number 34 and the Chart
was prepared as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon indicates the position of mind. She is
in 2nd from 7th Bhava in the Star of Venus and in the sub of Rahu. Venus is the
Asc. Sign lord and Rahu is posited in 10th in his own star and in Mercury sub.
1st Cusp is in Moon star and in Mercury sub. Chandra star Lord Venus is in Moon
sign, Saturn star and Moon sub. 7th Cusp falls in Mercury star and sub. So the
query is related to himself for business partnership and its longevity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For partnership 7th Bhava is to be judged
and for its longevity the Maraka and Bhadhakasthana of 7th are to be judged.
7th cusp falls in Scorpio which is a fixed sign. So 9th from it is the
Bhadhakasthana for it. It is 3rd from the Asc and falls under Cancer sign,
Saturn star and Ketu sub. The Maraka Sthanas are in Sagittarius and Taurus
signs ir. Ketu star, Mercury sub and Moon Star, Mercury sub respectively. Let
us judge each House separately.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="538" src="img/image048.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Bhadhakasthana is under Cancer sign, Saturn
star and Ketu sub. Venus is posited there. Moon and Saturn are in Venus stars
and hence they are the strong significators of this Bhava. Besides these, Venus
is also the significator of this Bhava.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2nd Bhava from 7th is under Sagittarius
sign. Ketu star and Mercury sub. Moon is posited there and Mercury, the only
planet in her star, is the strong Significator of the Bhava Moon is the second
grade significator and Jupiter being the sign lord is the 3rd grade
significator of this Bhava. Second Marakasthana is in Taurus sign, Moon star
and Mercury sub. Sun is posited there. No planet is in Sun star. Hence it is
the strong significator of this Bhava. Moon and Saturn are the 2nd grade
significators being in the star of Venus who is the sign lord of this Bhava.
Rahu and Ketu are also the Significators of these Houses. Hence Moon, Saturn,
Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Sun, Rahu and Ketu are the significators of
Bhadhakasthana and Marakasthanas. To select the few strongest and to eliminate
the rest, Prof. K. S. K. suggests to see the Ruling Planets at the time of
Judgement and these are as follows :-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn - Day-lord for Saturday</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus - Moon Star</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter - Moon Rasi Lord and Asc Lord</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu - Lagna Star Lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now he is running Venus Dasa, Rahu Bhukti
and Mercury Anthra. Now I was disturbed by some visitors and the work had to be
stopped. Again on 26-6-'70 Friday at 5.30 P.M. the Judgement was considered.
The ruling planets were as follows :-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus - Daylord</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn - Moon star Lord</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter - Moon Rasi Lord</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars - Asc. Lord</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury - Asc. Star Lord</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On 13-8-'70 he will run Venus Dasa Rahu
Bhukti Mercury Anthra and Saturn Sookshma till 8-9-'70 and this period favours
the desolation of Partnership.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here Anthara Lord Mercury is very important
as it is the sub-lord of 11th Cusp from Asc. as well as for seventh. Besides
this Mercury is also the sub-lord of Asc. 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 11th and
12th Cusps. Nodes are in the sub of Mercury. So Mercury being the chief among
the Karaka Planets of Business, promises for the desolation of Partnership, but
besides this it also promises that the querist will not close the firm out
right and he will do his business under the same name and style by making an another
partnership deed and this event will happen between 13-8-'70 to 8-9-'70. Now
let us check the transit period and see whether it tallies with ruling planets
or not. Mercury will be retrograde on 31st August, and hence she will
contribute the results before 31st August.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In transit on 28th August Friday, Sun will
be in Ketu star and Mercury sub Moon will be in Saturn star, Saturn sub and in
own sign. Dasanath Venus will be in Mars star, Jupiter sub and Mercury sign.
Bhuktinath Rahu will be in his own star, own sub and in Saturn sign.
Antharanath Mercury will be Sun star, Saturn sub and in own sign having a rapt
conjunction with Sun who is deputised by Ketu. Sookshmanath Saturn will be in
Mars sign, Sun star and Rahu sub. Thus the transit agrees with the
fructification of results.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.22_TIME OF MARRIAGE _K.P_3"><span lang="EN-US">LETTER TO THE EDITOR</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Respected Sir,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These days I am reading your
