KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI that the Nirayana cusps are considered in quite a
different way from the old traditional system. The way Mr. Krishnamurti
attaches importance to the constellations and subs of different cusps and their
proper application to any particular chart is really marvelous. He is quite
right to say that the cusps denote exclusively the indications of Bhavas
reflected for the native. This is scientific and appealing to any intelligent
mind. In case of twins or children born in near proximity of time, what is that
which changes? All the planets and their degree positions remain almost the
same. It is only the cusp and the cusp alone, which changes so rapidly with the
lapse of the most minimum period of time. Hence cusps must be given their due
importance in analysis of any chart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At times, when the analysis of Bhavas does
not point out a particular planet as a significator or wherever there is some
confusion in regard to selection of significators for a particular point in
consideration, the cusps alone come to our rescue and solve our problem.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now the principle to be commonly applied is
very simple.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mark where a particular cusp lies, what is
its constellation and what is its sub. Further mark whether any planet is
posited in the constellation of the, constellation lord of the cusp. If so,
take the planet as a significator. If no planet is posited in its
constellation, consider that very planet alone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly mark who is the sub lord of a
particular cusp. Further notice whether any planet is posited in its
constellation. If so, that planet will be a very strong significator, because
according to K.P; it is the sub and sub alone which decides a particular
matter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this article, it has been my sincere
endeavour to highlight this consideration.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.23_OVERSEAS – EXAMPLE_2"><span lang="EN-US">II. The Chart</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="557" src="img/image049.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_08.23_OVERSEAS – EXAMPLE_3"><span lang="EN-US">111. ASTROLOGICAL ANALYSIS</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This chart is to be studied from the point
of view of foreign travel or overseas.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us first of all know the principle
according to K.P. for this consideration.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"One will have the opportunity to go
overseas only when the 12th Cusp sublord is a significator of house 3 or 9 or
12 and the event would take place during the conjoined periods of the
significators of houses 3,9 &amp;12."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the above chart, the 12th cusp sub lord
is Jupiter and he is a significator of 3rd house (by ownership of the house).
Hence this native has got the opportunity to go overseas. Let us find out the
time of event.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Consider houses 3,9 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3rd house is occupied by Ketu, Sun &amp;
Venus. No planet is in the constellations of Ketu &amp; Sun. Ketu, Sun, Venus
and Mars are in the constellations ruled by Venus. Jupiter is owner of 3 and no
planet is in its star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So Ketu, Sun, Venus &amp; Mars and Jupiter
are the significators of 3</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9th House is occupied by Rahu. Rahu alone
is tenanted in its own star. Owner of 9th house is Mercury. Only Mercury is in
its own star. So Rahu &amp; Mercury are the significators of 9th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th house is occupied by none-Mercury is
the owner, in its own star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the significators of houses 3, 9
&amp;12 according to the above analysis are Ketu, Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
Rahu &amp; Mercury. The nodes are stronger than the planets. Here Ketu is
conjoined with Sun &amp; Venus and also in the houses of Jupiter. So kethu is
stronger and can be substituted for Venus, Sun &amp; Jupiter. So also Rahu for
Mercury. Hence the strong significators are Ketthu, Rahu and Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Actually, the native left for UK on
3.10.1951 during Saturn dasa, Rahu bhukti, Mars antara and Saturn shookshma.
The day is ruled by Mercury, Moon's sign is Libra, ruled by Venus, Moon's star
is Swathi, ruled by Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It may be slightly surprising to note that
Saturn has come as Dasa lord as well as shookshma lord, at the time of
fructification of the event because he is not finding a place as one of the
strong significators during our analysis of houses 3, 9 &amp; 12. Though he
qualifies himself as one of the significators, by virtue of being aspected by
Mars and also conjoined with Mercury but it is only feeble.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Please note that Saturn is the sublord of
3rd and 9th cusp and no planet is tenanted in his star except himself. So as I
mentioned in the beginning of this article, Saturn has emerged as a strong
significator in the above case, by owning the sub of relevant cusps and not
from analysis of bhavas. Thus the importance of cuspal sublord is portrayed
through this example.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.22_TIME OF MARRIAGE _K.P.html">← TIME OF MARRIAGE _K.P</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.23_OVERSEAS – EXAMPLE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.24_SCHOLARSHIP FOR HIGHER STUDIES.html">SCHOLARSHIP FOR HIGHER STUDIES →</a></div></body>
