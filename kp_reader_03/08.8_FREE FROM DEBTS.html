assets and the liabilities of his or her parents. As years pass on, even when
the parents are alive, one may save separately some amount or incur debts.
After the demise of one's parents, one may have to borrow if the expenses
outweigh the income. One may have decent bank position for some years. Then he
may have to borrow. Later he may return and clear off either part of the loan
or discharge it in full.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All these depends on the dasa and bhukti
which follow one after the other.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One deposits money in the bank when one has
income more than his expenses at that time. It is indicated by the houses 2, 10
and 11. 6th is for borrowing and thereafter depositing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The second house is for self acquisition
and bank position, the 6th house for 'Borrowing'; the 10th house means
profession and the 11th house indicate 'profit'.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During the conjoined period of the
Significators of 2nd and 6 one will borrow. The 8th house threatens risk,
danger and loss or a windfall if the Significator of 8 is also Significator of
6 and 11. The 12th house indicates expenses, purchases, donation, repayment of
loan etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Lagna represents the person to whom the
horoscope belongs. The seventh house denotes the persons who either lends or
borrows. As loan is an income to the borrower, it is the expenses or investment
to the lender which is indicated by the 12th house to the 7th house. Therefore,
one has to examine the 6th house for the debts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Expenses include the discharge of loan. It
may be a part - payment towards the debts or one may clear off the loans and be
free from it. Bank overdraft is also indicated by the 6th house and discharging
it is judged from the 12th house. In Uthra Kalamritha, Kalidas has said that
one has to consider the 12th house for the clearance of loan.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the second house denotes one's financial
position the second to the seventh shows the finance of one with whom the
native transacts. Suppose there is a benefic in the 8th Bhava, it means that
the person with whom one transacts, is lucky during the period of the planet in
8. Generally, one regains the money that is lent to others. In a few cases, it
so happens that one is to consider oneself lucky, if he somehow or other has
his money returned by the person who borrowed. In the latter case, the persons
who borrowed will have a benefic in 8. The borrower will gain without effort.
So he repays. That is why, he who lent money is lucky, during the period of the
benefic in the 8th house. If circumstances force one, he borrows. Is there
anybody who would not mind maintaining one's prestige? No, everybody will try
to keep up his or her word and maintain one's family prestige honour, etc. All
will make efforts to return the amount borrowed in time. He can do so, if there
is a benefic in the 8th house especially the lord of 12. The lord of 12 in 8
will cause Vipareetha Raja yoga. Suppose Jupiter is the lord of 12, and it is
in the 8th house, it can aspect one's 12th house and 2nd house. Therefore,
people born in Makara - Capricorn Lagna will return their debts during
Jupiter's periods and sub periods, without strain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose there is an evil in the 8th house.
It means that he who lends money has a malefic in the 2nd house to the 7th. As
malefics in the second house threaten loss of money during its period and sub
periods, one will lend money to the native of the horoscope having a malefic in
the 8th house and will be depressed, disappointed and irritated during its
period as the borrower is not able to return the loan. Those who lend money
should note, whether the borrower has a benefic or a malefic in 8 before lending
money so that he may know where he stands. These are the methods to be
followed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This native is born in Libra Ascendant.
Mars in Aries is in the 6th house. Jupiter owns the 6th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, note the constellations of Mars
and Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars rules Mrigasirisha, Chitra and
Dhanishta - Jupiter governs Punarvasu, Visaka and Poornapathrapatha.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Find out the planets situated in the
constellation of Mars and Jupiter; Also, note which planets are in the sub of
Mars and Jupiter. They indicate (a) the necessity to borrow money, and (b) the
time of raising the loan.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So also note the planets occupying the
constellation of the lord of 8 (venus, a benefic) and the lord of the 12th
house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun: Labhadhipathi, lord of 11, who is to
give you profit, who is to increase your income, as it aspects the 11th house
one will normally predict, that you should gain and there is no necessity to
borrow. But, actually you had been borrowing. Why? Because Sun was in the
constellation of Jupiter, the lord of 6 and the sub of mercury, lord of 12.
Hence during the period of Sun, you will borrow from A, and repay it, then
borrow from B, repay and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon was in Mercury's star and Rahu sub.
Hence, Moon indicates repayment by making money in your profession.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu in 11, in the constellation of the
lord of 11 and in the sub of Moon, promises that you will have no debts in the
conjoined period of Moon and Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As you had 7 years, 11 months and 26 days
of Mercury Dasa at birth, you enter into Moon dasa on 5 - 3 - '64.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore between 5 - 8 - '65 and 5 - 2 -
'67 you will repay and clear off your debts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As 'A' dasa, 'B' Bhukti, 'A' Anthra will
offer the result to the full extent, Moon anthra, in Moon dasa, Rahu Bhukti
shows the time when you are free from debts, i.e., 20 - 11 - 1966 to 4 - 1 -
1967.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.7_FINANCE BY BORROWING.html">← FINANCE BY BORROWING</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.8_FREE FROM DEBTS">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.9_THEFT AND RECOVERY.html">THEFT AND RECOVERY →</a></div></body>
