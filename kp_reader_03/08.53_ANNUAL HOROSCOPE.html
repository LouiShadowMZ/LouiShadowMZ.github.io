<body><h2 id="heading_08.53_ANNUAL HOROSCOPE_0"><span lang="EN-US">ANNUAL HOROSCOPE</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A horoscope is erected for the moment when
Sun during its course comes back to the original degree, minute and second of
the Zodiac where it was at the time of the birth of a native. To find out such
a moment it is necessary to have the ephemeris of that year for which one is to
read the results and erect a map for that year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But those who follow 'Krishnamurti
Padhdhati' (1) find the difference in the ayanamsa between the year of birth
and the year chosen for annual horoscope, (2) add this to the Sayana position
of Sun at birth, (3) note the time when Sun comes to this position.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Using the ephemeris and Raphael's Table of
houses one has to calculate, deduct the Ayanamsa given by Krishnamurti and make
out a map. [Only when Ephemeris with </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Sayana position
of planets</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> is used, the above exercise is needed]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It may be asked, at the moment when Sun
enters into original degree and minute if the person were to be in a foreign
place, then how to erect the horoscope; is it for the latitude and longitude of
the birth place or are we to take latitude and longitude of the place where the
person is at that time. We have to erect only to the locality where the person
is at that moment and not the original birth place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">While judging the annual horoscope, the
astrologer has to give the orb (a range) or 5</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> for the
aspects among Sun and Moon and the aspects among the major planets should be
only 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. The conjunction, the opposition, the trine
etc., give only one degree. Other aspects are considered to be weak.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Compare the original horoscope with the
position of the planets for that particular year. Beneficial aspects between
those in the radical chart and in the annual horoscope promise fortune in that
year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Position of the luminaries Sun and Moon are
considered to be vital. If either of the luminaries were to be either in 1 or 4
or 7 or 10 and if they form good aspects with each other then the coming year
is to be declared as a fortunate one. If majority of planets are deposited in
the angles it is also an indication that, the year is an important one. If
Jupiter or Venus or lord of 2, 10 or 11 were to occupy the 10th house or both
exactly in the meridian and if they also receive beneficial aspects either from
Sun or Moon that promises prosperity in that year. But if the lagna is occupied
by Saturn, Mars, Rahu or Ketu or Uranus and Neptune, then it indicates that in
that year there will be disease, difficulty, dispute, debt etc., If evil
planets occupy the 6th house and also form evil aspect to lagna it is sure that
one will suffer in that year both in health condition and in financial
position. Luminaries Sun and Moon if they are conjoined with benefics both by
nature and by lordship the year is in general a pleasant one. Moon if it were
to be afflicted by malefics then it is a bad year. If Moon with Mercury or
Uranus happen to occupy the lagna bhava then the native will be making frequent
travels and he cannot stick on to one place. If they occupy the 12th house
along with lord of 2 or 10, he will have a change in the profession. Saturn has
a peculiarity. Whenever it occupies the lagna bhava the chronic disease from
which one had been suffering will in that year frequently flare up and cause
misfortune. If lord of lagna occupies the 7th house in the annual map there is
a chance for marriage. If one is already married, if the wife had gone on camp
or tour, she will come and rejoin. The lord of the 2nd house in the annual map,
if it were to be either in lagna or the 10th or the 11th house, it shows,
peace, pleasure and prosperity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lord of 5 has such similar disposition
and if it receives good aspects from the lords of 2, 6 and 11 one can come by
fortune, unexpected advantages will accrue. If the lord of 8 were to occupy
either the lagna or the 6th house there is always difficulty and danger. If
lord of lagna similarly occupies 6 or 8 and if it is afflicted it is also
dangerous. If the lagna in the annual horoscope happens to be the 7th house in
the radical horoscope then that year will prove to be adverse. If Moon or lord
of 12th were to occupy the 9th house it indicates long journey, overseas and
life in a foreign place; if evil planet with Mercury owning the 12th house is
afflicted and occupies the 7th house one will lose by transaction or by theft
or cheating.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out the time of event according to
annual horoscope it is said the every result in one's life is indicated by at
least a house and a planet. Therefore whenever the luminaries either conjoin or
square or oppose a planet, one will face with difficulties. But if Sun, Moon
and the significator form beneficial aspect to the house signifying the matter
in query or if they form good aspects with the lords of those houses then his
desire will be fulfilled. So one has to take the transit of the planets from the
moment of the erection of the horoscope till it again comes to the same degree
next year. One has to judge taking into consideration the various aspects
formed by the transiting planets to the position of the planets erected in the
annual horoscope and this is what the Westerners generally do.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Hindu system, Kalidas has given one in
the book Uthra Kalamirtham. There is another system 'Tajik'. Let me give what
Kalidas says. Erect the horoscope as mentioned above. Give importance to the
position of Moon at that moment. Calculate the portion that is to be covered by
Moon. Work out the following periods as the dasa period of the planets for that
year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun is allotted 110 days, Moon 60 days,
Mars 32, Mercury 40, Jupiter 45, Venus 56, Saturn 4, Rahu 5 and Lagna 10 days.
These periods just like Udu Dasa follow in a cyclic order. To find out which
dasa commences first and how many days it has to run, note the position of the
Moon in the star. The dates allotted to each planet is to be multiplied by the
portion that is left over that is to be covered by Moon divided by the whole
star which is equal to 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20'. This gives the number of
days on a particular dasa which is to run from the time of the erection of the
horoscope.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The star in which Moon was, does not
indicate the first dasa lord. To find out which dasa operates, follow a
separate system. In which star Moon was at the time of the Solar year day.
Count it from the natal star. So Natal star is taken as 1, then 2, 3 and so on.
Find out in which number of the star Moon is posited. Divide by 9. Note the
remainder. Sun dasa starts first. If the remainder is 2, Moon dasa of 60 days;
If 3 is the remainder then 32 days of Mars. If 9 is the remainder, or 0 is the
remainder take lagna and 10 days for lagna dasa. That portion which is to be
covered multiplied by the total number of days allotted to the planet, divided
by 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' will be the number of days of the dasa left
over. It is to operate first from the moment of the erection of the chart.
Suppose the remainder is 4, then Mercury Dasa will be the 1st. and suppose
1/4th of the asterism is left over then of the 40 days 1/4th is 10 days.
Therefore 10 days of Mercury Dasa is to run from the time of the birth. After
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn follow, pass on, and then Sun, Moon, Mars.
Now only 335 days will be over. So the other 30 days will be the 30 days of
Mercury Dasa which was first rejected. Because that portion was already
traveled by Moon. Thus one is to find out the dasa period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kalidas says that one has to include the
transit result of the planet during that year in relation to the position of
Moon in one's horoscope and then the results of the various dasas in that year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Sun is beneficial, accumulation of
wealth, purchase of jewels and new house. Weak Sun threatens committing of sin,
loss by enemies, litigation, loss of wealth and troubles. Beneficial Moon gives
royal favour, improvement in bank position, prestige and honour. Weak Moon
shows that there will be inimical activities and irritation, disease, change of
residence and misunderstanding with all. Favourable Mars indicates favour from
the Government, success in attempts, happiness, purchase of land etc., (commencement
of an industry may be included). Weak Mars shows dispute, litigation, quarrel
even with own children, partition, no harmony among the couple, extra expenses
etc. Mercury well posited shows an active, alert, energetic action to enjoy
one's life and have larger profits. Weak Mercury brings misunderstanding with
one's cousin or uncle and also gives the mind to take all bad ways and be
unfriendly with good natured people. Strong Jupiter indicates purchase of
vehicle, house, property and also come out successful in education and
litigation. Weak Jupiter indicates change of residence and expenses outweighing
income, take bad ways and associate with dirty fellows. Strong Venus shows that
the native will enjoy the fruits of life in the world with much wealth and
fame. Venus also indicates that there is every probability of marriage in that
year during its dasa period. Weak Venus threatens loss of health, enmity,
disharmony, dispute, disease, etc. strong Saturn indicates that one can acquire
estate, building, house and may hold a position of trust and the chronic
disease which he had been suffering from will flare up. Strong Rahu shows that
the native may marry in its dasa period and he will have promotion and
prosperity. If it is bad, it may include the demise of the parents. When the
lagna dasa is on generally the result will be good. But it depends upon the
planets which occupy the lagna. While predicting include the various aspects to
the cusp of the ascendant and also the planets in the ascendant. so far, both
Western and Hindu system of erecting the annual horoscope and reading out the
result is given.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati
erection of the horoscope remains the same. One has to follow the following
principles. Note down.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) What can Sun contribute to you? Where
is your lagna? To which Bhava Sun is the lord? In which house is it posited and
in which constellation and sub? So note down what Sun can contribute for you.
Similarly note down what Moon, Mars, Mercury and so on, indicate by their
nature, lordship, occupation of a bhava, constellation, sub etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ii) What are the constellations governed
by these planets? That which is indicated by Sun will be given by the planets
situated in or transiting in the constellation belonging to Sun i.e., Karthika,
Uttaram, Uttradam; Moon representing certain matters will be given by the
planets to one, according to annual horoscope posited in or transiting Rohini
or Hastham or Sravana. Each planet rules three stars according to Udu dasa
system. Whatever a planet signifies the same is indicated by the stars governed
by them. Those results will be enjoyed while a planet transits there and the
source is shown by the transiting planet. So, whenever a planet transits in a
constellation the planet is the source of the result; constellation indicates
the nature of the result; the time event is fixed precisely by considering the
sub i.e., note the sub. When it moves in a particular sub which is ruled by a
benefic, he will enjoy that nature of the result; if the same planet moves in
the same star and transits in a sub which is unfavourable and disagreeable,
then even though the nature of the result will be the same yet one will be
disappointed or the result will be unfavourable and he will be displeased.
Therefore the planet is the source; the constellation lord indicates the nature
of the result and the sub lord shows how he enjoys, what the source is and
whether such a result contributes for pleasure or displeasure; whether it is
successful or failure. For example, if Venus, indicates one's marriage and if
Venus star Barani is transited by lord of 2 or 7 or lord of 11 in that year,
then whenever the significator moves in favorable sub, negotiations regarding
marriage will come nearer and whenever it transits unfavourable sub, result at
that time will be delayed or one may reject the offer and a fresh attempt will
be made when it moves into another beneficial sub. Though the matter relates to
marriage as is indicated by the lord of the constellation, the various events
about marriage is clearly shown by the sub, transited by the significator.
Annual horoscope is made use of by the majority of the people in North India.
But this annual horoscope is not worked out to that extent in South India
especially in Tamilnad and Kerala. So many people were under wrong impression
that Solar map was introduced by Westerners. It is not correct. In olden days,
even Kalidas in Uthra Kalamritham has mentioned </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Tajik</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> system is an elaborate one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether the results are beneficial or
adverse, in full they agree with Udu Dasa system, progression etc. One does not
contradict the other. It is mysterious.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.52_PROGRESSION.html">← PROGRESSION</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.53_ANNUAL HOROSCOPE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.54_ASHTAKA VARGA.html">ASHTAKA VARGA →</a></div></body>
