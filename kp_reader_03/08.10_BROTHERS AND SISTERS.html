not afflicted, or from Moon sign, if it is more auspicious and strong,
indicates all about brothers and sisters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Third house denotes the next conception by
mother: the 5th indicates the second conception: the 7th shows the third
younger brother or sister and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Karako Bhava Nasaya</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> fails miserably, as many people having Mars in the 3rd house, are
born with many brothers both younger and elder. But one is to judge the 3rd
house counted from the position of Mars. If Mercury, Moon, Mars and Jupiter are
in 3 and 11 from Lagna or lord of Lagna there will be many brothers. Ketu
therein shows sisters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The number of brothers and sisters is
ascertained from the strength of the third house and its lord, the rasi and the
navamsa of the 3rd house. Also it is guessed from the navamsa of the occupant
of the 3rd house and Karaka, Mars. The number of sisters is found from the
female planets in 9 and the brothers from the male planets in the 9th house.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.10_BROTHERS AND SISTERS_2"><span lang="EN-US">KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati it is
the sublord of the cusp of a house which indicates whether the matters of the
houses are positive or negative. If the sublord of the third cusp is in the
constellation of a planet occupying a dual sign or it itself is in a dual sign
or if the cusp receives good aspects from a planet in a dual sign. (e.g., Mars
from Gemini by the 8th aspect aspecting the 3rd house Capricorn where the 3rd
cusp falls.) Only in these cases there will be plurality of brothers or sisters
or both. In case of twins, when one of them happens to be a boy, the other a
girl then even though according to traditional system the Lagna remains in the
same sign, star and navamsa., Yet to each the number of brothers or sisters
will be found. Traditional Astrology cannot be helpful. Because the twin
brother will have among brothers one less and among sisters one more. But the
twin sister will have among brothers one more and among sisters one less. I.e.,
if other than the twins whose parents would have had two sons and two daughters
then the twin boy will have two brothers and three sisters whereas the twin
sisters will have three brothers and two sisters. Therefore, it is the cusp of
a Bhava which will decide whether there will be plurality of brothers or
sisters and at the same time according to K.P. it is not yet found possible to
find out a single rule to give the number of brothers or sisters and also the
sex. No doubt the research is being done by very able and intelligent
astrologers at Delhi. And I am sure that it would be possible to give correctly
the results which will be 100% successful. It will be published in the Magazine
ASTROLOGY &amp; ATHRISHTA</span>”<span lang="EN-US">. If one is to find out the
longevity of the next younger born it is advisable to take the 3rd cusp as the
ascendant of the next younger and then for that locality of birth (Latitude)
one is to find out the cusps of the other houses keeping the 3rd cusp as the
ascendant. Then only the sub lord of the 3rd cusp will vary. Otherwise when the
9th cusp indicates Father then the younger one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
partner in life will also be indicated by 9th cusp. (7th to 3rd) The ruling
planets at the moment of the birth of father, and sister</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s husband or brother</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s wife will not be the
same. So by research it has been decided that the 3rd cusp must be taken as the
lagna of the younger and then for that Latitude the other cusps should be
worked out. Now the 9th cusp according to one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
horoscope indicates father, the 7th cusp to the 3rd (which forms the lagna of
the younger) indicates the partner. Here both the results are correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to K.P. Significator of the 3rd
