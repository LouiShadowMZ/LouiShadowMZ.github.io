<body><h2 id="heading_08.57_RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME_0"><span lang="EN-US">RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When one is doubtful about his exact time
of birth, but says that it may be around 15 minutes this way or that, is there
any method by which one can find out the exact moment of birth?</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.57_RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME_1"><span lang="EN-US">Answer</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I shall give some of the methods which are
available. How far you can rely on them, is left entirely to you, to the
readers and to the research scholars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Convert the approximate time of birth
given in I.S.T., to Vighatis after Sunrise (Sunrise will be given in L.M.T.
convert to I.S.T.). Multiply by 4 and divide by 9. The remainder is the number
of the star counted from Aswini, Makham or Moolam. Suppose Sun rises at 6 A.M.
Birth is at 8 A.M. That is the birth took place 2 hours after Sunrise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1 Day = 60 Ghatis = 3600 Vighatis</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1 Hour = 2 </span>½<span lang="EN-US"> Ghatis
= 150 Vighatis</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1 Ghati = 24 Min. = 60 Vighatis</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1 Minute = 2 </span>½<span lang="EN-US">
Vighatis</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1 Vighati = 24 Seconds.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the birth is 2 hours after Sunrise then
it means it is 5 Ghatis = 300 Vighatis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Multiply by 4 and divide by 9</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then </span>（<span lang="EN-US">300</span>×<span lang="EN-US">4</span>）<span lang="EN-US">/ 9 = 1200 / 9 = 133 ⅓</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Remainder is 3. That is, it means that Moon
at the time of birth should be in the Nakshathra which is the 3rd from Aswini
or Makham or Moolam i.e., it may be Karthikai or Uthrapalguni or Uthrashada.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But, suppose the star is Chithra, then one
is to find out that Vighati, next to the number of Vighatis given by
consultant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He mentioned 8 a.m. = 300 Vighatis after
sunrise. So you should add or subtract 1 Vighati or 2 or 3 and so on till you
get the remainder 5 which shows the three stars Mrigasirish a, Chithra and
Dhanishta.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore if one is born at 305 Vighatis or
296 Vighatis, the remainder after multiplying by 4 and dividing by 9 will be
only 5. But the person says that it may err to a maximum of fifteen minutes
either way. Then find how many Vighatis will yield the same result.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following Vighatis will give the
remainder 5.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">278; 287; 296; 305; 314; 323; 332; 341 and
so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">278 Vighati is after 7.45 A.M. and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">341 Vighati is before 8.15 A.M.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which will you give?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Another method mentioned is as under --</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note where Mandi was at the time of birth.
The Lagna sign will be either 5 or 7 or 9 or 1 when counted from the sign
occupied by Mandi </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> (Then alternatives are given </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> either to Moon or Lagna, either in Rasi or Navamsa).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Mandi and Lagna are to be in 1, 5, 7 or
9 the consultant asks, why then the same author gives the results of Mandi
occupying any house from Lagna. I.e., the first, second, third, fourth etc., up
to 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">How to reconcile?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sign is to be either 5 or 9 (for
example) it can be useful to find the Lagna, correct to 30.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Navamsa is taken, the position of Lagna
is correct to 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20</span>′<span lang="EN-US">. As the
Navamsa Lagna changes roughly once in 13 or 14 minutes, how far will this
calculation give a precise answer?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) In Uthra Kalamrita, it is said that the
interval between Sunrise and the time of birth is to be converted into
Vighatis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Divide by 225.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then males are born if the remainder is
between 0 and 15; or 45 and 90; or between 150 and 225. Females are born if the
remainder is between 15 and 45 or between 90 and 150.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">According to this method, we have to
multiply 53 </span>¾<span lang="EN-US"> Ghatis by 60 (he has taken the time of
birth as 53 </span>¾<span lang="EN-US"> Ghatis) to convert them to Vighatis, thus
53 </span>¾ ×<span lang="EN-US"> 60 or 215 </span>×<span lang="EN-US"> 15. This has
to be divided by 225. Thus, 215 </span>×<span lang="EN-US"> 15 divided by 225
gives a quotient of 14 and remainder of 75. This falls with in second Group (45
to 90) which shows that the sex is </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Male</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the first example taken, when a first
principle is applied, the birth may be between 278 and 341 Vighatis. So the
remainder may be 53 or 62 or 71 or 80, or 89 or 98 or 106 or 115. So if the
consultant is male (presuming that the horoscope belongs to the consultant)
then 55; 62 or 71; 80 will be one of the timings. If the consultant is a lady,
then the number of Vighatis will be 98 or 106 or 115 when both the rules 1 and
3 will be satisfied.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Pre-natal-Epoch.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Much is said about this. Very briefly let
me state how it is not useful to one and all. Suppose two persons are born with
the Ascendant and Moon as shown below, say they are born at an interval of 30
minutes on the same day.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="266" src="img/image081.jpg" width="553"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to the rules, find where Lagna
and Moon at the time of Epoch to A and B are. Moon is passing 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 17 in Aquarius, on the same day, which is the position of Moon
on the day of Epoch.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="260" src="img/image082.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What is the rule, find out the exact time
on the day of epoch when Lagna for A will be Gemini 6 and for B Lagna will be
Gemini 6</span>°<span lang="EN-US">15</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It can be only one minute.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the Lagna of Epoch were to be, say 2
P.M. to A, then for </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">B</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> it will
be only 2-01 P.M.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now we have to calculate where Moon would
be, on the day of epoch, for A at 2 P.M. and for B at 2.01 P.M.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is more or less the same position;
probably it moves by 0.5 minute.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, in the Epoch Chart it is worked out and
found that when Gemini 6 rises, on the day of Epoch, Moon was actually in 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">15</span>′<span lang="EN-US">40</span>″<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whereas for B, when the ascendant is in 6</span>°<span lang="EN-US">15</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Moon was in 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">16</span>′<span lang="EN-US">20</span>″<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now, we have to take that, for </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> in his horoscope, the Lagna should be 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">15</span>′<span lang="EN-US">40</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> and for the
chart B, Lagna is 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">16</span>′<span lang="EN-US">20</span>″<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Think, awhile. If one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Lagna on a particular day is 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">15</span>′<span lang="EN-US">40</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> and the other</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
Lagna on the same day is 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">16</span>′<span lang="EN-US">20</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> what should be the interval between one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
birth and the other. It can only be two minutes. But what is the actual
interval, 30 mts. Then how far we can boldly declare this to be a method for
rectification is to be judged by the readers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take two births actuals.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In a hospital on 8-11-1945 there were two
births. One child was born at 5.30 P.M. the same nurse went to the next room
and attended upon another lady and another child was born at 6 P.M. on
8-11-1945. Both want to find out the correct time of birth by applying Prenatal
Epoch.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The horoscope of the child born at 5.30
P.M. on 8-11-1945 at 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US">19</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> N
and 82</span>°<span lang="EN-US">30</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> E and that of the
other at 6 P.M. in the same hospital are as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="271" src="img/image083.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Sidereal time at Noon on 8-11-45 = 15
hours 9 min. 14 secs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="429" src="img/image084.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A couple may have pleasant time every
night. Yet, one cannot say which night function would have been fruitful. The
day itself is not definite. Further, the male spermatozoa can enter into female
ova at any time after copulation within a period of 38 hours. Therefore at
which moment, the epoch commences nobody can say, even though one knows the
period of few minutes of pleasure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally, from the time of epoch, the
growth commences and the intra-uterine life will be around nine months, i.e.
nine solar months or ten lunar months.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. There may be an increase or decrease in
this period. It is found that it depends upon four factors i.e. (a) whether
Moon was waxing </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Sukla Paksha, increasing in light or
the longitude between Sun and Moon is increasing from the New Moon; or (b) Moon
was waning </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Krishna Paksha, decreasing in light or the
longitude between Sun and Moon decreasing from the time of Full Moon, (c)
whether Moon is found above the horizon, anywhere in the houses 12, 11, 10, 9,
8 or 7; (d) or Moon is found below the horizon, anywhere in the houses 6, 5, 4,
3, 2 or 1.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then, the period of intra-uterine life in
above nine solar months if (a) Waxing Moon, is below horizon (houses 1 to 6) or
(b) Waning Moon is above horizon (houses 7 to 12) and it is less than nine
solar months if (a) the Waxing Moon is above horizon (houses 7 to 12) or (b)
the Waning Moon is below horizon (houses 1 to 6).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">II. To find out which sign would have been
occupied by Moon on the day of Epoch and which part of the Zodiac will be
rising at the time of Epoch one is to follow the following rules.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose, at the time of birth, it was Sukla
Paksha, i.e., Waxing Moon, then the Ascendant at the time of Epoch will be the
sign and the position of Moon at the time of birth. The day of Epoch is that
day on which (around 9 months prior to birth) Moon transited in that sign and
around the degree of the Lagna at the time of birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the above examples, Moon gets separated
from Sun. New Moon was over. It is increasing in light. It is called Waxing
Moon. As the Lagna in the first example is 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US">6</span>′<span lang="EN-US">. Taurus, 7th cusp will be 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US">6</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Scorpio. Therefore Aries, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, Sagittarius
and the portion between 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Scorpio and 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US">6</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Scorpio are above the horizon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the position of Lagna at the moment
of Epoch should be 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">11</span>′<span lang="EN-US">
Sagittarius (which was the position of Waxing Moon at the time of birth).
Further the day of Epoch will be 18th February 1945 (9 months before the birth
time) when Moon was transiting around 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US">6</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Taurus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the second example, the position of
Lagna at the time of Epoch will be 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">26</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Sagittarius (as it was Waxing Moon at the time of birth) and the
day of Epoch will be 19-2-1945 when Moon transists 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US">29</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Taurus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">III. Find the exact time on the day of
Epoch when that part of the Zodiac will rise in the East on the day of Epoch
which is the position of Moon at the time of birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For this, one is to take the table of
houses for the Latitude at which the mother stayed during those pleasant days.
Here in these examples, the mother was during the pleasant days and the painful
day, all along, in the same place. So from the table of Houses for Latitude 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US">19</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> note the sidereal time given for the
Ascendant in Sagittarius 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">11</span>′<span lang="EN-US">
i.e. look down the column </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Ascendant</span>’<span lang="EN-US">. When you come to the 7th line on the right side page, you will
find Asc. 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">15</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Sagittarius
when the sidereal time would be 12 hours 22 mts. And 2 secs. If you calculate,
you will find that 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">11</span>′<span lang="EN-US">
Sagittarius would have risen when the sidereal time was 12 hours 21 minutes 44
seconds. Suppose a child is born on 18-2-1945 and you find the sidereal time at
the time of birth of a child is 12 hours 21 min. 44 seconds, then what is the
actual time of birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="166" src="img/image085.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="227" src="img/image086.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you calculate deducting rectification
for the interval at 10 secs. Per hour, you will get the figure 14 hours 27 mts.
as the interval between previous noon and the time of birth i.e., 2.27 am on
19-2-1945.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Find out the position of Moon at 2-27 a.m.
on 19-2-1945 Moon at 2-27 A.M. on 19-2-1945 will be 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">30</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Taurus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly if one works for the time on
19-2-1945 when Asc. 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">26</span>′<span lang="EN-US">
Sagittarius rises. It will be found that the sidereal time would be 12 hours 22
mts. 50 secs. And the time of birth will be 14 hours 30 mts. 30 secs. added to
previous noon i.e., 2-28-5 A.M. on 19-2-1945.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Calculate the position of Moon for this
time 2 hours 28 mts. 5 secs. A.M. 19-2-1945. It is 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">36</span>′<span lang="EN-US">1</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> in Taurus. Therefore the Lagna at the
time of birth for one born at 5-30 P.M. is arrived at as 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">30</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Taurus and for the other born at 6 P.M.
it is found to be 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">36</span>′<span lang="EN-US">1</span>″<span lang="EN-US">, as the position of Moon at the time of Epoch is the position of
Lagna at the time of birth, if Moon at birth was waxing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Will this method of rectification be
useful?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati and the
simplest method of multiplying the number of Vigatis from sunrise to the time
of birth by 4, dividing the product by 9 and counting the star from Aswini
trine will give the exact Vigati.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This method gives confidence, convinces one
and proves to be correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Brihat Jataka, written by Varaha Mihira
in Chapter 26, there are 17 stanzas to cast the horoscope of a person whose
time of epoch (impregnation) and also the time of birth is not known. He gives
the method to erect a horoscope from the time of query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From this, one can understand that the time
of birth and the urge to work out and erect the horoscope of a native from the
moment of query has a direct bearing. They are inter-linked. There can be no
second opinion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore one is to follow the following
method:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Note the lord of the day when the query
is answered;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Note the star at that time i.e. the
lord of the constellation in which Moon transits;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Find the lord of the sign in which Moon
is;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Who is the lord of the Lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These planets will be the same who govern
the sign in which the Lagna is, the constellation in it, the sub and the sub
sub.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.57_RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME_2"><span lang="EN-US">Examples</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) A person wanted to know whether his
Lagna is Taurus last degree or Gemini first degree, so that he may know whether
Venus or Mercury is the lord of the Lagna. This person visited at 9-5 A.M. on
27-4-1966. The Lagna at the time of query was Gemini owned by Mercury. The day
is Wednesday governed by Mercury. Moon is in Punarvasu star ruled by Jupiter.
It is in its own sign and is aspected by Mars. Hence Mercury, Jupiter, Moon and
Mars are the ruling planets at the time of query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The doubt is whether it is Venus sign, Mars
star, Saturn sub i.e. between 27</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-53</span>′<span lang="EN-US">-20</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> and 30 Taurus or between 0 and 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-53</span>′<span lang="EN-US">-20</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> which is
jointly ruled by Mercury lord of the sign. Mars is the lord of the
constellation and Mercury lord of the sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets at the time of query
having nothing to do with Venus and Saturn. But Mercury and Mars agree. Then
what about Jupiter and Moon. As Jupiter is in Lagna at the time of query, take
as Jupiter sub sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Calculate the time when sub sub of Jupiter
will rise on the day of the birth of the native. That is the time of his birth.
His Lagna is Gemini and its lord is Mercury. Venus is not the lord. No other
rule can categorically eliminate one and correctly give the true Lagna. Is not
this method convincing? 32 of my students who are very intelligent tried to put
this method to test. They tested on their horoscopes and their children which
they know. They are convinced and this is published for the readers to use this
method and be benefited.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Another person on 3-5-66 asked whether
he is born in Scorpio or Sagittarius. The day is Tuesday ruled by Mars, Moon in
Virgo owned by Mercury, the constellation is Chitra governed by Mars; Moon is
aspected by Saturn, Mercury and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The doubt is whether the lord of the sign
is Jupiter or Mars. Actually the birth will be at Mars sign, Scorpio, Mercury
star Jyeshta Saturn sub between 27</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-53</span>′<span lang="EN-US">-20</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> and 30 Scorpio. It cannot be
Sagittarius as the time of query has nothing to do with Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Next after finding out the sub, one is to
calculate when that sign, constellation and sub will rise in the East on the
day of birth and when it will be over.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the first case, Gemini sign rose in the
East 5 Ghatis 16 Vigatis after sunrise i.e. 316 Vigatis after sunrise. Multiply
316 by 4 and divide by 9. 4 is the remainder. Count from Aswini trine. His star
in which Moon transited at the time of birth should be, according to this
calculation Rohini or Hastham or Sravanam. But his star is Jyeshta. The
remainder should be 9. Then you add or deduct one, one Vigati from the time of
birth. The nearest one shows the actual Vigati of birth. If you add one to 316,
multiply by 4 and divide by 9, balance is 8; if you add one more, balance is 3.
If you add one more and do the process remainder is 7 and so deduct one from
316. You get 315. Multiply by 4. The product is 1260. Divide by 9. It goes 140
times which may be taken as 139 times and the remainder is 9 when you count
from Aswini trine, it agrees. Therefore, declare that his time of birth was 315
Vigatis after sunrise on that day to that locality.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The above method alone can clearly fix the
position of Lagna, give the correct time of birth and convince the consultant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(An Astrologer has to pray: gain the Divine
Grace: develop intuition: but treat this science scientifically: God never
fails to guide. He gives the tip to correctly eliminate the incorrect one and
select the right one accurately).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Another example to decide time of birth:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During war time, the clocks showed one hour
in advance of actual time. A native born in 1942 has got his horoscope
correctly erected for his time of birth. But has got the doubt, whether the
time taken for erection of horoscope was actual time of birth or the clock
time. His horoscope is given below. According to this, the time taken for
calculation was 4-26 am (correct time). The clock time might have been 5-26 at
the time of birth. The problem is to find out whether the chart below is
correct:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of birth: 4.26 A.M. on 8.11.42/9-11-42</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="270" src="img/image087.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note down the time of analysis. It is 7-35
A.M. on 7-4-66. Find out the ruling planets. Since the chart is taken only to
find out whether it is correct or not, the ruling planets at the time of
analysis should have ruled the birth time also. In other words, the analysis is
to find out the birth time only. Hence when the birth occurred, the planets
ruling should also rule the moment of analysing the horoscope also; otherwise
the horoscope is wrong.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By ruling planets, it is meant as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) The lord of the day;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Lord of the star in which Moon
transits;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Lord of the sign (Rasi) in which Moon
transits;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Lord of the lagna sign or the sign in
which the Ascendant transits;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) The lord of the star rising in the east
i.e. the star, in which the Ascendant transits.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On 7-4-66 at 7.35 a.m., the ruling planets
are as below:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Jupiter : Lord of the day Thursday</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Rahu   : Lord of the star
Swathi</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Venus : Lord of Libra-Thulam (Rasi) in
which Moon was transiting</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Mars   : Lord of the lagna
Aries-Mesha</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Venus : Lord of the star Bharani rising
in the east at 7.35 a.m.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu, unaspected by any planet, represents
lord of the sign Taurus </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Rishaba in which it is
posited. Lord of Taurus </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Rishaba is Venus. Rahu
represents Sun, since it is in the constellation Karthik ruled by Sun on
7-4-66.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Venus should
have ruled native's time of birth. The native was born on Sunday ruled by Sun.
At 4-26 a.m. on 9-11-1942 (birth day) exact time, the lagna was Libra-Thulam.
Star rising was Chitrai. The sign Libra-Thulam is ruled by Venus. The
constellation rising is ruled by Mars. Moon was transiting in Visakam star
ruled by Jupiter at the time of birth. Hence at 4-26 A.M. exact time on
9-11-1942 the ruling planets were Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the birth were to be at 3-26 a.m. (exact
time) lagna would have been in Virgo-Kanni ruled by Mercury, the star rising in
the east would have been Hastham ruled by Moon. Since Mercury and Moon do not
rule the moment of analysis, the native could not have been born at 3-26 a.m.
exact time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us find out whether 5-26 a.m. exact
time corresponding to clock time of 6-26 A.M. might have been the birth time.
At 5-26 A.M. (exact) the star rising was Swathi ruled by Rahu in the sign
Libra-Thulam ruled by Venus. Since Rahu and Venus rule the present moment this
could have been the birth time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now how to select? Was it 4-26 a.m. or 5-26
a.m. (both) time exact time, when the birth took place?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Find out the lord of the lagna at the
moment of analysis. This should have been the sub sub lord rising in the east
at the time of birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) At 4-26 a.m. on 9-11-1942 find out lord
of star rising, lord of the sub rising and lord of the sub sub rising. Lord of
the sub sub should be Mars (lord of lagna at the moment of analysis) if 4-26
a.m. exact time were to be correct. At 5-26 a.m. on 9-11-1942 (exact time) sub
sub lord of the star rising in east was not Mars. Hence the native should have
been born at 4-26 a.m. on 9-11-1942 corresponding to the clock time 5-26 A.M.
since the clock showed one hour in advance of actual of exact time.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.56_RAINS AND ELECTRIC SUPPLY.html">← RAINS AND ELECTRIC SUPPLY</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.57_RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.58_HORA AND ITS USE.html">HORA AND ITS USE →</a></div></body>
