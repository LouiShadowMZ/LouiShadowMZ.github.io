and was patiently hearing you, while offering predictions to your clients, you
used to mention often 'Guru-Balam' (or Vyazha Balam as Kerala people say, or
Brahaspathi's beneficial strength during transit as North Indians say) has
come. Hence one can get married or if one tries for service, he can enter into
one; or if one makes attempts in any direction, he will come out successful and
all the pending matters will take a favourable turn and materialise. But, how
is it that nowadays you never use the phrase 'Guru Balam' at all."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes! Yes" judging from the way
things are happening nowadays, I have my own doubt whether Jupiter possesses
any beneficial strength at all. It appears that it has lost much of its
strength and that Venus is gaining more and more strength."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Why? What makes you, Sir, to consider like
that?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"It is not on any single point, I have
come to this conclusion. In every walk of life, I find a thorough change."</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.13_CONVEYANCE_1"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter has become weak</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Years ago, girls within 12 years of
age got married. The parents understood from the astrologers when "Guru
Balam" comes for the girls and whether the so-called Guru Balam was there
or not, they celebrated the marriages while the girls were young according to
their individual luck or fate. They followed the tradition, did the religious
rites for four days, and observed the Vaideek Dharmas and Karmas. Is it not a
surprise nowadays for you to hear that a girl is getting married at her 14th
year of age? Is there any wedding being celebrated for four days, performing
Homam etc. Is not late marriage the order of the day. How many do Sandhya -
Vanthanam regularly? Tharpanas to the departed souls are not done by many, at
all. To do pooja, people do not find time. Temples are not visited by them
unless something happens. Further, where is the respectful regard to the elders
now? That is why I feel that Jupiter's strength is waning and marriage to the
girls in proper age has become a problem.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus gains strength: True! But how do you
say that Venus (Sukra) is gaining more strength? Is not Venus, the Chief
Governor for matrimony?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Conjugal Bliss: No doubt, Venus is the
Karaka for "Conjugal Bliss"; it is also the governor of music, fine
arts, Bharatha Natya, conveyance, vehicle, vahanam, wealth, ornaments, ladies,
etc. Conjugal happiness can be had.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Music: Consider music (vocal as well as
instrumental): in every nook and corner, you hear music. Radios and transistors
are plenty. Whether you own or not, you hear music during day and night.
Sangeetha Sabhas are springing up everywhere. Musical concerts are arranged
very frequently. Music Schools and Colleges are being opened. How many Cinema
theatres are in existence and how many more are under construction? Also, the
Touring Cinemas cater to the needs of the hamlets and villages. Bharatha Natyam
had practically ceased to exist. Nowadays every girl has the desire to learn
and earn a name.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Transport: Let us consider transport.
Decades ago, our ancients took years to go round India. There were a few
conveyances, and that too, which will move very slowly. But see how quickly
they go round the world. Travel on land, seas, and in air are so frequently
made that we have vastly improved in transport and travel convenience.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is for chemicals. Students prefer to
study chemistry medicine and chemical engineering.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ladies: Venus represents ladies. What an
advancement in colleges and schools the admission of ladies is increasing year
by year. Ladies enter into service, politics and even take up administration.
Ladies have swimming pools. They compete in sports. They drive cars, carts,
plane, etc. They have won Noble Prizes. There is also a lady cosmonant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Considering all these - absence of interest
in vaidheek ceremonies - Sath Karmas, essential for Para Loka Suka, and more
and more indulgence in Iha-Loka- I have to take that the strength of Jupiter is
waning whereas that of Venus is waxing."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"No doubt, what you say is convincing
enough; Further, when we enjoy some conveniences for some time, then without
them, it is difficult to live. When I was in active service, conveyances were
available at a moments call. After my retirement, all the so-called friends
avoid me. Now, my son is doing business and he wants to buy a car. What do you
say?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Have you brought the horoscope of
your son?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"I have got both mine and his."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Come on, let me examine both."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Here, Sir, Let me have your
considered opinion. Please say who will buy."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"As you asked me to give 'considered
opinion' I shall think aloud and finally offer my prediction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Vahana-conveyance-is represented by the 4th
house counted from one's Lagna as well as the beneficial effects of Venus.
Fourth house, in addition to conveyance, indicates one's landed property, house
property; estate, forest, cattle, mother, education, etc. If the fourth house
is strong and has the beneficial aspect from Mars alone, one will buy land,
building, etc. Aspect from only Mercury indicates education. Aspect from Moon
shows mother. Venus indicates vehicles. Hence beneficial connection to the 4th
house does not mean possession of vehicle or purchase of a car, alone. It may
indicate the purchase of lands or buildings also.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But to state definitely whether one has
'Vahana Yoga' or not, the houses 4, 9, 10 and 11 counted from the ascendant as
well as the benefical aspect of Venus, Moon or Jupiter should be considered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"You said that the fourth house
represents Vahanam. Why then, should the houses 9, 10 and 11 also be
examined."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"House 9 is called Dharma, 10 is Karma
and 11 is Labha. Houses 9 and 10 show one's fortune to enjoy his life in this
birth, due to the meritorious deeds done in the previous birth, 9th house is
termed as "Poorvapunya Sthanam". 9th house indicates long journey,
whereas 10th house shows pilgrimage."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"What about the 11th house?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house denotes whether one can have his
desires fulfilled. To possess a cycle in youth, a scooter in school days -
(till a child is born to him or her) and then a car, with radio set, etc., is
the desire of almost every one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, if houses 6, 7 and 8, counted from
a Bhava, are not occupied by malefics, but are occupied by benefics, then the
matter indicated by the Bhava will thrive." Therefore 9th, 10th and 11th
houses show whether they sanction or deny this yoga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Venus is said to be the chief
governor for conveyance. Why then, should Moon and Jupiter be examined?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Venus is the Karaka by nature. Moon
owns the 4th sign of the Zodiac indicating change of residence, journey and
conveyance. Jupiter owns the 9th house, showing one's Bagyam, long journey,
etc., and Jupiter owning the 12th house of the Zodiac indicates investment. By
nature, Jupiter shows one's financial position. All these three planets are
natural benefics contributing to pleasant life in this world, hence, they need
careful consideration."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Alright! Vahanam is a general term.
There are various Vahanas, viz. Naravahanas like palanquins, rickshaws, etc.
Miruga Vahanas like carts, jutkas, coaches, tongas, etc; to cross water there
are boats and steam launches; instead of using the power of a man or an animal,
by using oil, petrol or water; we have scooters, motorcycles, motor cars, motor
boats, ships, aeroplanes, helicopters, etc. Is it possible to find out, which
vahana one will use?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To go by palanquin carried by others or a
rickshaw pulled by poor people is indicated when</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) lord of the 4th house and Venus occupy
the Ascendant;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Moon and Saturn are both exalted in the

connected with Saturn shows travel by camel. If they are connected with moon,
travel by elephant or horse or mule is indicated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the lord of Lagna is associated with
these yogas, or if the yoga-causing planets are associated with Lagna, one will
own and use the Vahana.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Should, however, the lords of 6, 8 or 12 be
associated, or the yoga producing planets are in 6, 8 or 12 or if Rahu is in 4,
or is conjoined with the lord of 4, one will use "Hired vehicles" or
other's ones.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Saturn and the lord of 6 are connected
with Vahana-Yoga producing planets, one will be a driver. If Saturn is also the

use of power-propelled machines like motor cycle, car, etc.?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Mars indicates machinery and motor;
Moon is a watery planet and shows water; Mars is a fiery planet and Moon
denotes steam; Saturn stands for Geology and Moon for oil, kerosene; Venus is
for purification. Therefore Saturn, Moon and Venus indicate petrol. Hence these
planets, when associated with the houses 4, 9, 10 or 11 indicate "use of
such motor ones".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If they are in human signs, they show
two-legged vehicles. If they are in quadruped signs, they indicate train, etc.
Mars and Moon stand for steam train; Mars, Mercury or Uranus stand for electric

malefics are bound to happen. They cannot be averted, dodged or prevented by
doing Shanthi or by one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s will or trying to sit at
home.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let two instances be quoted here. When a
gentleman was warned, he asked the editor to mention a number which will be
fortunate for him, so that he can avoid any accident. The astrologer said </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">6</span>’<span lang="EN-US">. So he had the car number as </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">6</span>’<span lang="EN-US">. On the eventful day, (which he knew) he
had a fancy for his friend</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s new car and drove it.
Alas! At the time already predicted he dashed against a person, and he had to
face the consequences.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In another case, an injury was predicted to
a doctor, years ago. He remembered the date as 19th December. So he granted
leave to his assistants-did not go to the dispensary-took seat in his easy
chair at home and was reading a medical bulletin. At that time, his youngest
child crawled and went in between the four legs of his cow. By chance the
doctor noticed it. He did not shout. But he got up suddenly, slipped, fell down
and broke his arm on 19th December.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, evil indicated by malefics will
surely happen. No doubt the physician is a God-fearing gentleman. He is
liberal-minded. He treats the poor free. He does Pooja, etc. Look at this.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Alright: Nowadays it is not easy to get a
car, especially in this locality. Can you guide me from where he can have it,
please?</span>”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Generally the direction from where one can
get the car is indicated by the lord of the Bhukti in Vimshothari dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also it will be the direction indicated by
the rasi containing the largest number of beneficial dots in Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s ashtakavarga. From your son</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s horoscope I
can say that</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) he will borrow money; after 1 year and
2 months and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) will buy a car, from a place north of
your residence and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) will enjoy his life, (giving you lift
occasionally);</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) except on one occasion when he gets
into trouble by dashing against an animal and a boy</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sublord of the 4th Cusp shows whether
one can have vehicle in his life time or not. If the Sublord is in the
constellation of a planet who is significator of 4, and is connected with Venus
one must have.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.12_HOUSE TO DWELL IN.html">← HOUSE TO DWELL IN</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.13_CONVEYANCE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.14_EDUCATION.html">EDUCATION →</a></div></body>
