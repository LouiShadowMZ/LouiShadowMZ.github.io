<body><h2 id="heading_08.38_REGAINING LOST POSITION AND RETIREMENT_0"><span lang="EN-US">REGAINING LOST POSITION AND RETIREMENT</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of birth was 5-45 P.M. on 20th
February, 1924 at 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US">11</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> North
and 77</span>°<span lang="EN-US">29</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> East. The horoscope
is as follows:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="548" src="img/image070.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu Dasa balance at the time of birth is
exactly 4 years.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sir, The Query is to find out whether your
seniority will be restored, if so when? Or will you resign and leave the job,
if so when?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To regain one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
position, one has to judge the house 10 and 11, as 10th house indicates the
position, fame, reputation and honour in profession and also the 11th shows one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s realisation of ambition. Both the houses are vacant. The lords of
the cusps of the 10th and 11th are ruled by Mars and Venus. It will be
surprising for you to note that I am taking your horoscope at a time when
Bharani Nakshatra is on. It means Moon is transiting in Mars, sign and Venus
star. Therefore the two planets which are to fulfil your desire will be Mars
and Venus. The other planet which will also contribute for your success will be
the lord of the day and the lord of the lagna in which I am now dictating. Now
the lagna is Kataka, ruled by Moon and the day is also ruled by Moon, being
Monday. Therefore, one can boldly declare that you will have your desire
fulfilled. You are running Mars Dasa, Ketu Bhukti upto 14th January, 1969. Mars
Dasa, Venus Bhukti commences on the happy Pongal day of the Hindus. Moon sub
period in Venus will be in April-May, 1969. I am sure that the day of order for
regaining the lost position would be 3rd May, 1969, when Sun transits in
Bharani Nakshatra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to this horoscope, there is no
planet in Mars star, no planet in Venus star. Therefore, Mars and Venus are the
two, who in their conjoined period, will do good. No node is conjoined with
either of the two or occupying any of the four signs owned by those two
planets. Therefore, it must come through and you must regain as the sub lords
are favourable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Regarding the 2nd question, one has to find
out when you will be running the period of the significators of the houses 1, 5
and 9. Moon and Rahu are in 1. Mars alone is in 5 and no planet is in 9. The
lord of the 9th is Jupiter. Budha is in Moon</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
constellation. Sani and Ketu are also in Rahu</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star.
Guru</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star is not occupied by any planet and Mars star
is also not tenanted by any.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Taking the ruling planet at the moment of
judgment as lagna is in 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> of Cancer, you will retire
from the service after the full term during Rahu Dasa, Budha Bukthi, Ketu
Anthra, i.e. in 1979. Hence the question of resigning the present post during
Mars Dasa or in the first half of Rahu Dasa is out of question.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.37_WHEN WILL I RETIRE.html">← WHEN WILL I RETIRE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.38_REGAINING LOST POSITION AND RETIREMENT">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.39_TIME OF SANCTION OF PENSION.html">TIME OF SANCTION OF PENSION →</a></div></body>
