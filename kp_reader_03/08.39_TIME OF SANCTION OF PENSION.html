<body><h2 id="heading_08.39_TIME OF SANCTION OF PENSION_0"><span lang="EN-US">TIME OF SANCTION OF PENSION</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even though one is entitled for pension
from the time of retirement why there is delay in a few cases? Whose fault is
it? Government or your action in the previous birth or your service in this
birth!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A member puts this question within himself,
after he has become dejected with the slow speed of the authorities concerned
regarding the settlement of his pension. His horoscope and the facts are as
under.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="572" src="img/image071.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="581" src="img/image072.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Born on 1-11-1908, entered into service on
14-7-1927 and gave notice for retirement in June 1961 and retired on 19-9-1961.
Pension is not yet settled. Indeed, four years and three months have passed and
the pensioner has waited for 51 long months in these costly days. Now, he puts
the question </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Whose fault is it?</span>’</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The correct answer is his </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Fate</span>”<span lang="EN-US">. Why? When some are receiving their
pension regularly and their accounts are settled around the time of retirement,
if this person is put into inconvenience, what will a few philosophers and
fatalists say except to confirm that he would have been working probably as an
officer in his previous birth and he would not have paid in time either the
salary or the pension to the servants, then. That is why, his delayed action in
his previous birth, has caused this undue delay in this birth. This is the
appropriate answer in accordance with Karma and Reincarnation Theory.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In practical life, the above is for
consolation. But the same can be explained by the astrologers applying the
various principles of astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The appointment was made when the person
had been running Rahu Dasa, Jupiter Bhukti and Venus Anthra on 14-7-1927, on a
Poorvashada star cay when Moon was transiting (though in the 12th sign) yet in
the sign owned by Jupiter and the star governed by Venus, lord of the 10th
house, indicating profession.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The date of retirement came in Saturn Dasa,
Mercury Bhukti, Venus Anthra, Rahu Shookshma, Mercury is the lord of 6,
indicating service and is also lord of 9 (12th house to 10), i.e. retirement or
leave.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now, when can he have his account settled?
Saturn is lord of 1 and 2. It is in its own constellation. It is strong and
hence it can never deny; but, according to its nature it must delay. Generally
for settlement of an account one has to scrutinize the houses 2 and 11. If it
is pension, as it is concerned with benefit through service the 10th house also
is to be included. The 2nd house is not occupied, but it is owned by Saturn.
Saturn governs the three stars, Pushya, Anuradha and Uthrapathrapada. No other planet
except Saturn occupies the constellation of Saturn. So, Saturn is a very strong
indicator. Therefore, the astrologer can boldly declare that whatever may be
the delay and however much it can throw obstacles, Saturn must give the full
pension before its dasa is over as it is the lord of finance and it is
beneficial for money matters. The total dasa period of Saturn is only 19 years
and so far the pensioner has enjoyed nearly 8 1/2 years, and another 10 1/2
hopeful years alone are left over. As regards the 11th house, there is no
planet, situated in the 11th bhava. But the node Ketu is in 11th house and the
stars governed by Ketu are Aswini, Makam and Moolam; Ketu alone is in Moolam.
Ketu is a significator. Mars is the lord of the 11th cusp. It governs
Mrigasirish, Chitra and Dhanishta stars. Of the planets and the nodes posited
in any group of constellations, the nodes are always stronger than the planets
and therefore, Rahu in Mrigasirish is to be taken. When the horoscope is
scrutinised, Venus conjoined with Mars and aspected by Saturn and also in the
constellation of Sun - representing the Government-shows that in Venus Bhukti
itself, it will be settled and sanctioned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, Saturn Dasa, Venus Bhukti and
Rahu Anthra commencing on 12th December, 1965 shows that in its period of 171
days it will receive the attention of the authorities and will be disposed.
Mostly the date of disposal would be in Ketu Shookshma. So, the pensioner gains
confidence that he will have the pension between 10-3-66 and 18-3-66.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to transit, the so-called
sade-sati i.e. the evil 7 1/2 years Saturn period will be coming to an end and
Saturn, the dasanatha will be in Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star and
Ketu sub. Jupiter will be transiting in the constellation of Mars and in the
sub of Saturn which is the lord of 2nd house. Venus, the bhukti lord, will
conjoin with the Ascendant in direct motion and transit in Lagna Bhava.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, astrology offers both peace of
mind and also a consolation for the delay as well as the mind to live on hopes
till 12-3-1966, when it will be sanctioned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even here Saturn will play its role. 12th
March happens to be a Saturday. What if? A second Saturday in the month of
March. So, it is a holiday and hence one is to wait for next Monday. Now one
may ask </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Is not the lord of the star stronger than the
lord of day</span>”<span lang="EN-US">? If it is to be strictly followed, should
not one find out where Moon will be transiting on that Saturday and note the
lord of the star. </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Oh God!</span>”<span lang="EN-US">
says the astrologer, leaning back on the easy chair - The star is Anuradha. It
is governed again by the delaying Saturn. That is why probably, our ancestors
have given Saturn, the last day of the week, to be governed by it. Otherwise,
in the middle of the week, it may throw obstacles and cause difficulties.
Saturn is a friend for people who are very slow and a foe for fair deal. If
this paper moves slowly similar to Saturn in the Heavens it is only due to his
Saturn Dasa and not the Government.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He gathers courage and asks the astrologer </span>“<span lang="EN-US">If my pension will be settled before this official year, then shall
I get the increment due to me, when I was in service? The authorities regularly
gave me increment in the same scale of pay for the same post held by me from
September, 1955 till 1960. Only the increment for 1961 remains to be paid</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The astrologer says within himself </span>“<span lang="EN-US">I pity with you. God also hears your prayers. Authorities are
reminded periodically. But what God or the Government can do, when your fate is
so strong that the authorities cannot settle your account in these 51 months
and another couple of months to come.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At any rate, on the above date, Saturn will
knock at your gate and say </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Late is due to your fate</span>”<span lang="EN-US">. Actually, the date of Sanction was 26-3-66.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.38_REGAINING LOST POSITION AND RETIREMENT.html">← REGAINING LOST POSITION AND RETIREMENT</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.39_TIME OF SANCTION OF PENSION">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.40_POLITICS.html">POLITICS →</a></div></body>
