days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury Dasa starts on 6-9-69.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us judge why he took photography. 10th
cusp is in Venus star Jupiter sub. Venus, by nature, denotes photography.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Prosperity depends on the period which is
to run. If we analyse, Mercury (11th cusp sub lord) and its results, then one
can know how the gains would be. Mercury is posited in the 8th house. It is in
Saturn star Jupiter sub. Saturn is lord of 11 and 12. It is in 7th house. It is
exalted. Saturn shows that one will invest money (lord of 12 and no planet is
in 12). Saturn as lord of 11 promises gains. It is in 7. So it threatens that
you should not have any partner for any business. Because it is significator of
7 and also 12. Mars suggests independent venture. Saturn &amp; Mars encourage
your independent business and denote mixed results as Saturn owns the 11th and
12th houses. But in 11th Bhava Ketu is deposited. Venus alone is in Ketu stars.
Hence Venus promises success and prosperity through the matters which Venus
indicates. Photography is one of those which Venus indicates. Hence during
Mercury Dasa, there will be speedy turnover, larger profits, satisfactory bank
position, etc., and also during the sub periods of Saturn in July, August 1983
some worry especially through Tax Department. Otherwise, the whole of Mercury
Dasa from 6-9-69 is beneficial. Customers increase. You will appoint more
assistants. You will not be in difficulty to get materials. Costly ones will be
purchased by you during Mercury Dasa Venus Bhukti Saturn Anthra in November
1974. Expansion and improvement from November is promised. Between 1969 and
1974 every year will show steady improvement.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Western System Sun just
progresses in 10th house. It will be there for 25 years more when name,
reputation, prestige, prosperity in profession, etc. are promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon by progression, now passes in 12th
house, after 2 years Moon assures that Luck starts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to transit, from 7th March, 1969,
