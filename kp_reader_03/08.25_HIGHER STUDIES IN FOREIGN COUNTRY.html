<body><h2 id="heading_08.25_HIGHER STUDIES IN FOREIGN COUNTRY_0"><span lang="EN-US">HIGHER STUDIES IN FOREIGN COUNTRY</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The horoscope is as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon Dasa balance 7 years 4 months 20 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="533" src="img/image051.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For high school and College studies which
need regular attendance to learn the subjects by hearing the lectures from the
beginning to the end, one is to judge the houses 4 and 11. If one has to work
himself, do research, submit thesis etc., or if one is to leave his native
place, remain in a hostel in the foreign land, leaving his kith and kin and
enjoying new surroundings environments, one is to judge the houses 9 and 12 and
to come out successful, 11th house significator should also be the significator
of either 9th or 12th house or both.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here lagna is 3 42' Scorpio. 9th house
extends from 5 40' Cancer to 8 40' Leo. Occupant is stronger than owner.
According to K.P occupant of a constellation is stronger than the lord of the
constellation. Constellation is stronger than the sign. Occupant of a sign is
stronger than the lord of the sign. Planets conjoined with or aspected by a
planet gains the strength to offer those results which those planets signify.
Thus a planet becomes the significator of a few matters. The source of the
result is shown clearly by the Bhava - house occupied by the planet and the
house or houses which it owns (owner of a house means owner of the sign where
the cusp or cusps of a bhava or bhavas fall).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is the occupant of the 9th Bhava. Its
constellations are Arudhra, Swathi and Sathabisha. Sun and Kethu are in Rahu's
star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is the lord of the sign where 9th cusp
falls. Rohini, Hastham and Sravanam are governed by Moon. Moon, Sani and
Mercury are in Moon's star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When so many planets indicate a result, it
means that they are connected with this, 9th house results. If they happen to
be the significator of 7th house also, it means, it is the 11th to the 9th. 9th
house indicates the father of the native; hence the 7th house, which is the
11th to 9th indicates success in father's attempts, cure from the disease and
realisation of his ambition, other than what it denotes the native, i.e. to
have a partner in life or to enter into a contract with another. Moon is in 7.
It is in its own constellation. So Moon indicates 9th and 7th house matters.
Saturn is in 7. Saturn is in Moon's star which occupies 7th house. So Saturn
presages matters, signified by 7th and also the 9th house. Therefore during
Moon and Saturn sub periods, not only the native will enjoy 7th and 9th house
matters, but the native's father will achieve his aim.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards overseas, judge the house 12 as
it promises, separation from family, living in new surroundings and
environments. 12th house extends from 8 40" Libra to 3 40' Scorpio. Sun is
deposited in the 12th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now one should remember that in everybody's
horoscope there are the houses 3, 9 and 12. There must be few significators of
3, 9 and 12 at least two. Why? Any one planet may own the houses 3 and 12 or 9
and 12 and the other can own the third house. These two planets may not have
any planet in their constellations and also no planet in these 3 Bhavas. Then
only these two planets will be the owners and significators. When every
individual have got at least 2 planets, why should not everybody make long journeys,
go overseas and stay in the foreign land during their conjoined periods and sub
periods. Majority do not go overseas. Simply to satisfy themselves, just like
what I did when I was very young, they can take a big world map, spread it on
the ground. Then stand where Africa is shown. Say, I am in Africa. Take away
the footsteps, keep them in Australia map and say "I am now in
Australia". Lift your legs and keep where America is drawn. Say "I am
now in America". That is all. But the surrounding and environments remain
the same. One can go only when the sub lord of the 12th cusp is connected in
any manner with 3rd or 9th house; preferably 9th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this chart, 12th cusp is in 8 40' in
Libra. The constellation is ruled by Rahu; the sub is also governed by Rahu.
Rahu is in the 9th Bhava. If he would have been born one minute later, the sub
lord will be Jupiter who is in the 8th Bhava (in his own constellation) which
is Vyaya to the 9th house, in which case he cannot go overseas.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If twins are born, one with Rahu as the sub
lord of the 12th house cusp and the other twin with the sub lord of the 12th
cusp as Jupiter, then even though</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) The planets are in the same bhava</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Dasa and Bhukti same</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Ashtaka Varga same</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Gochara same</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One enjoys and the other is disappointed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When two people have the same chart with
less than </span>½<span lang="EN-US"> a degree differences in lagna position one
is able to differentiate by applying K.P. As Rahu is the lord of the sub of the
12th cusp, this native will and must live in a foreign place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When Rahu is the occupant of the 9th house
in the constellation of Kethu in 3 it is connected with land journeys, and long
journeys.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence this native has got the opportunity
to go overseas. Now comes the question of finding out the time of event. It
will be Rahu Dasa, Moon Bhukti, Saturn Anthra. Consider the ruling planets at
the moment of judgement.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Today it is Thursday. It is ruled by
Jupiter. As a node - Rahu - representative Jupiter by occupying his sign, take
Rahu Dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now the lagna that is rising in the East is
12 30'. It is Saturn's sign and Moon constellation as the time is 6 - 51 a.m.
on Thursday 23 - 1 - 1969 at Madras. Hence Rahu acting as an agent of Jupiter,
Saturn and Moon are the significators (star is also Uthrapadra where Moon
transits and it is Jupiter sign Saturn star).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence he will go overseas during Rahu Dasa,
Moon Bhukti, Saturn Anthra, Third week April 1973.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.24_SCHOLARSHIP FOR HIGHER STUDIES.html">← SCHOLARSHIP FOR HIGHER STUDIES</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.25_HIGHER STUDIES IN FOREIGN COUNTRY">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.26_CHANGE IN JOB_ 9TH HOUSE EXPLAINS.html">CHANGE IN JOB_ 9TH HOUSE EXPLAINS →</a></div></body>
