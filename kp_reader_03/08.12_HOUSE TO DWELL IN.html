<body><h2 id="heading_08.12_HOUSE TO DWELL IN_0"><span lang="EN-US">HOUSE TO DWELL IN</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The fourth Bhava (house) in a horoscope
signifies the permanent possessions, viz., land, building, or vehicle, the
mother as well as one's education.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mahadeva in Jataka Tatwa says that a person
will reside in many houses if the 4th house is a movable sign; or if its lord
occupies a movable sign or the Karaka Mars is in a movable sign. It means that
during the periods and sub periods of the planet in 4 which is a movable sign,
one will change his residence; if the 4th sign is fixed, but its lord is in a
movable sign, the person will change his quarters; or during the period of
Mars, one has to change his dwelling, if Mars were to occupy a movable sign; In
Savartha Chintamani, Venkatesa says that movable signs indicate houses in many
localities.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"If the 4th house, its lord or Mars
were to be in a fixed sign, the person will live permanently in the same
house." The 4th house may be a fixed sign. So planets in 4th Bhava and in
fixed signs, will not allow one to change his quarters. If the lord of the 4th
house, which may even be movable, occupies a fixed sign during his period, the
native cannot shift. If Mars occupies a fixed sign, the native will remain in
the same house during its period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"If the lord of the 4th house is in a
benefic Amsa, he will live permanently in one building (Chap. III, Sl.98 to
100.")</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He says "Find out who owns the first,
second and fourth houses? Note how many of them occupy either Kendra or Kona,
(Kendra means 1, 4, 7, 10,; Kona means 1, 5, 9.) Depending on the number of
planets, one is to predict the number of good houses resided in and to be
resided in by the person."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Jataka Parijata it is said that the
acquisition of houses is to be determined from the 4th Bhava.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He says: If the fiery planets, Sun or Mars,
occupy the 4th Bhava and be in depression or in enemy's camp, the person will
not own a house."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"If the lord of the 4th Bhava is in
the 12th house, the native will live in other's houses in a foreign
place." "If the lord of the 4th house is in 8," the author says,
"there will be no dwelling house owned or tenanted by the native."
"If the lord of the 4th house be in the 6th house, he will lodge in a
house owned by uncle, cousin, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He adds "if the lord of the 4th house
is in a Dushsthana (i.e., 6, 8 or 12) or if an evil planet occupies the 4th
house, then the house owned by him will be haunted."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"The lords of 2, 4 and 12 in 12 in 3,
6, 8, or 12 indicate the number of houses to be lost by the native".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He encourages by saying that one will be
lucky to own as many strong houses in good condition as the number of
beneficial planets in the Trikonas and Kendras.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mahadeva is of opinion that the lord of the
4th house, in combination with the lords of 6 and 8, causes the destruction or
loss of the house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Varahamihira in brihat Jataka says that
people, born with Moon in Cancer or in Virgo, will own houses. It does not mean
that all those born in Cancer Rasi will build houses and those born with Moon
in Virgo will own them. Here one is to note whether Moon was in a favourable
sub and constellation. Also one should note the lordship of Moon. Otherwise, in
many cases, it will not come true. But those born with Moon in Gemini or Virgo,
Libra or Scorpio, Pisces or Aries, own good houses. If Moon is also strong and
beneficial, it will give a house to the person during its period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kalidas also has said in Uthrakalamrita,
that beneficial Moon and Jupiter will bless one with a house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Prithuyasas mentions that a person will
acquire a dwelling house during the dasa of a planet, if the dasa commences on
the day when Moon transits in Jupiter's sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One lives in other's houses during the
period of Mercury, if it would have been debilitated at the time of birth. Also
he says that persons, born in Meena Navamsa, live in other's houses. He is of
strong opinion that people born in Meena Navamsa, live in other's houses and
people born in Karthikai Nakshathra will own many houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One can have a strong house, if a benefic
occupies the third house and the lord of 4 is also strong.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The house will have a compound wall if
there is a benefic in the 3rd house and when the lord of 1 and 4 are both
strong.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, various authors have mentioned about
the dwelling houses.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.12_HOUSE TO DWELL IN_1"><span lang="EN-US">According to K.P.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) 4th Bhava signifies mother, vehicle,
education and building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Mars is the planet which governs
buildings, Moon the mother, Venus the vehicle and Mars as well as Moon, the
land.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore planets connected with the 4th
house and Mars will indicate dwelling house. 4th house and Venus indicate
conveyance; 4th house and Moon govern mother; 4th house and Mercury indicate
education.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the planet occupying the 4th house or
the planet in the constellation of the occupant, having connection with Mars,
the lord of the 4th house, if connected with Mars, and planets in the
constellation of the 4th house connected with Mars indicate buildings. If these
planets are not connected with Mars, but are connected with Venus, one will
have vehicle. If they have connection with Moon, the results refer to mother.
If Mercury has connection, it indicates education.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(By connection with Mars, it is meant that
a planet may)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) occupy the sign owned by Mars, or</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) occupy the star ruled by it, or</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) the sub (according to Krishnamurti
Padhdhati) governed by Mars, (whatever be the sign and the star.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, if one judges about one's house
to dwell in, one has to consider the planets connected with the 4th house and
also Mars:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) The Planets occupying the 4th house
(whatever be the sign) and are either in Mars star or Mars sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Planets in the constellation of such
occupants,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Lord of the 4th house in the
constellation or sub of Mars,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Planets in the constellation of such
lords,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) And the favourable situation of Mars to
the 4th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Acquisition of a house may be by
inheritance, legacy or by purchasing one. Hence, if the 4th house receiving
good aspects from the lord of 10, the native gets a building by inheritance.
Here, he does not withdraw money from Bank or borrow, and then buy or build.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if the 4th house has connection with
the lords of 1 and 12th the native will invest the money he has, and convert
liquid cash to a solid permanent possession. The second house indicates bank
position, one's movable property, liquid cash, etc. The first house indicates
that he makes efforts. Twelfth house shows that he spends and invests.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if the 4th house has connection with
the lords of 1, 6 and 12, one will borrow and invest or one may acquire a house
through co-operative society, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the lord of 1 is also the significator
of 2 and 6 has no connection with Mars, one borrows money by mortgage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the lord of 1 has no connection, but if
the lord of 4 and lord of 8 are connected, he will sell away the property. The
purchaser is represented by the seventh house; 8th house will be the second
house to the purchaser. So he acquires.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the lord of 4 is connected with the lord
of 12 and also Sun, either he loses the house by fire accident or through
public auction; one uses much of wood if the planet which gives the house is
connected with Jupiter. Kethu and Mars indicate that one will use well-burnt
bricks; Saturn and Venus indicate cement. Saturn, Venus and Mars indicate
reinforced concrete; Sun, connected with the planet offering the house, shows
that the roof may be thatched and grass might have been used; Moon indicates
that there will be copious supply of wholesome water; Mercury indicates that he
may have twin houses or servant quarters, outhouse, etc. Venus and Moon
indicate that one will use lime and render it to give the appearance like
marble; Mars and Venus indicate mosaic flooring; Venus gives garden, furniture
glass, etc. Saturn gives air-conditioning, frigidaire, etc. Mars improves the
kitchen; Venus the bedroom; Jupiter the cash-treasury room; Mercury the reading
room; Saturn indicates that he may have a locker, an underground room, cellar,
etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When one lets the house for others, Sun
indicates that it will be let to Government department or Government officials;
Moon for nurses, midwives, Navy people; those who work in water supply, etc;
Mars indicates surgeon, industrialist, police, military, etc.; Mercury shows
business people, agents, journalists, post office, etc.; Jupiter for bank,
school; Venus for hotels, silk shop, silver shop, for ladies; Saturn for
servants, labourers, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">That is why, some people build houses and
let them out for bank; some let them out for silk and silver shops; some for
laundry; some for saloon, etc. This can be clearly seen in the horoscope of the
native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So also one can find out that the owner of
the house where one lives, belongs to one of a particular caste or profession
or the quarters belong to Government or local body, etc. by scrutinising the
position of the lord of 4, the Dasanatha and Bhuktinatha; i.e. the lords who
rule the Dasa, Bhukti, Anthra, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following horoscope will explain the
sale and purchase of house during the different dasa that operated:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="566" src="img/image028.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars Dasa Balance 1 year, 9 months 23 days.
While this native was running Rahu Dasa, Rahu Bhukti, Mars sub period in the
first week of July, 1912, the house belonging to his father was sold away.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He purchased a house on 5 - 1 - 1940, when
Jupiter Dasa, Mars Bhukti, Jupiter Anthra was operating. He sold this house on
8 - 6 - 1958 during Sani Dasa, Rahu Bhukti, Sani Anthra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again on 4 - 7 - 1960 he purchased a
building during Sani Dasa, Guru Bhukti, Budha Anthra.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.12_HOUSE TO DWELL IN_2"><span lang="EN-US">Explanation for the transactions</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Rahu was in the 4th house-Evil planets
in the 4th house indicate loss of a house, if one possess already. That is why,
during Rahu Dasa, Rahu Bhukti and later in Saturn Dasa, Rahu Bhukti he disposed
off the houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Rahu was in Rahu's star and Mars sub.
That is why, during Rahu Dasa, Rahu Bhukti Mars Anthra, his father sold away
the house, when he was young.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Sani is lord of 11 and also 12;
therefore, during evil sub period the results indicated by evil house 12 will
operate. During the Bhukti of beneficial planets, in Sani Dasa, beneficial
results will be enjoyed as lord of 11. If a planet owns both good and bad
house, one should not divide a dasa into two halves and then say first half is
good, the other half is bad or first half is bad and the other half is good.
But the correct method of prediction would be that during the sub of beneficial
planets (not according to their nature, but judging whether one is a benefic or
not, by considering its occupation and lordship) to declare agreeable results
and also in the sub period of planets owning good houses counted from Lagna and
occupying favourable houses counted from Lagna and Dasanatha house;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) during Sani Dasa, Rahu Bhukti, Sani
anthra he sold away the house on 8-6-1958 and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) during Sani Dasa, Guru Bhukti (in 4th
Bhava) Budha Anthra (lord of 4th house) he purchased a beautiful house. During
Sani Dasa, Guru Bhukti, Mars Anthra he extended the building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Future Prediction: In December 1971, he
will purchase one more house during Mercury Dasa, Mars Bhukti, Mercury Anthra,
sell away one in Mercury Dasa, Rahu Bhukti, Sani Anthra and have one more in
Jupiter Bhukti, Mercury Anthra.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.12_HOUSE TO DWELL IN_3"><span lang="EN-US">Respected Sir</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You will recollect that I consulted you
last February 1966, regarding "Purchase of a New House". You gave
appointment for only 10 minutes; within the short time, you corrected my
horoscope, dasa bhukti calculations etc., and predicted that I will surely
purchase a house between 4th and 7th March, 1967. You also published the
details of the prediction in your Magazine April 1966 issue, and also in your
Padhdhati, Volume II, pager 143 to 145 (titled "Purchase of a house")
with my horoscope, without mentioning the name, and also discussed the various
points for your making a particular prediction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Proper indications came, during November
1966 and I purchased a fine house bearing No. 5 at Mundakanni Amman Koil
Street, Mylapore, Madras-4 and occupied the same during the period mentioned by
you, i.e., by 5th March 1967.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I am highly pleased to write to you this
letter as the prediction given by you is found to be quite correct, and I
assure you, Sir, that no other Astrologer gave such a correct and accurate
prediction mentioning the date etc., nor I think any can give.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this circumstances, I would also request
you to continuously conduct the lectures on every Sunday at Bharatiya Vidya
Bhavan at Mylapore to enable more friends to get in touch with you, benefit
through your valuable predictions, who in turn will offer correct prediction to
others and be useful to the public.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On this New Year's Day, we sincerely pray
Lord Uchishta, Maha Ganesh to bless you and your family with long life,
happiness and prosperity to enable you to continue this great service, you are
now doing to the common people like me, and by introducing a new simple method
of this "Krishnamurti Padhdhati" which is really very useful for us.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Once again; Thanking you, Sir,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yours sincerely,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A.V.K. MURTHY</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.12_HOUSE TO DWELL IN_4"><span lang="EN-US">PURCHASE OF A HOUSE</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="552" src="img/image029.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To purchase a house, one has to scrutinise
(1) the house (Bhava) 4, as the 4th house indicates permanent possession, land
and building, other than Vehicle, etc. The 11th house shows the gains which one
can have. The 12th house indicates the cheque to be issued in favour of one who
sells the house. Therefore, one has to look to the houses, 4, 11 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house indicates the acquisition. It
may be either a movable or an immovable one. Since building or land comes under
immovable property, one has to judge both the 4th and 11th houses. Unless we
pay, we cannot possess a house. Payment is indicated by the 12th house. So, the
houses 4, 11 and 12 are to be judged.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">While judging the houses, we have to find
out which planets occupy these houses and if so, note down the stars governed
by these planets. Ascertain which planets occupy the constellation of the
occupants of these houses. Whether there is any planet in such a constellation
or not, note down also the occupants. Undoubtedly, the planets in their
constellations are strong significators:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, note down the planets occupying the
constellation and also occupying these bhavas. As you have got majority of the
planets occupying the houses 11 and 12 and no planet is in the 4th house, we
can very well take that those planets which occupy these houses and also which
aspect these houses or rule these houses will surely bless you with a house.
For people born in Capricorn (Makara) lagna, Venus (Sukra) is Rajayogathipathi.
By Rajayogathipathi, one understands that one can have his desires fulfilled.
Saturn who is lord of 1 and 2, can contribute to one's success and acquisition.
Saturn is occupying the Constellation Poorvashada which is ruled by Venus
(Sukra), who is the Rajayogathipathi and Venus at the time of birth was
occupying the constellation Jyeshta ruled by Mercury (Budha), lord of 9.
According to me, there will be to some extent such beneficial results similar
to Darmakarmathipathiyoga (Lord of 10, occupying the constellation of lord of
9).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One is to note that unless the 9th or 6th
house also operates, it is not possible for one to take possession of the
building which one purchases. Why? 6th house is 12th to the 7th; which denotes
the person who sells. 9th house is the 12th to the 10th (which is the 4th to
the 7th.) In the constellation of lord of 6 and 9, Venus is posited. Therefore,
Venus is a strong significator. Lord of the 12th house is Jupiter and it is in
exaltation and it is also in the constellation of Mercury which also indicates
that the seller will lose his property as Mercury rules the 3rd and 12th houses
counted from 7th house. What is the 3rd house? 3rd house is Vyaya to the 4th,
4th house indicates permanent possession. Vyaya to 4th house would mean to give
away land or building. Therefore, planets occupying the stars of the
significators of the 3rd house are strong enough to indicate. Sukra Dasa, Sun
Bhukthi, Guru Anthra will be the period when you will purchase a house and
occupy it. When a doubt arises whether a particular anthra will give a result
or not, the best thing would be to note down the moment at which the person
puts the question. Moon is called Mathi. It indicates the mind. It gives the
urge to put a question. Note where Moon is transiting at the time when the native
puts the query. To-day, it is 21st February, 1966. Moon is in Aquarius (Kumba)
and in Poorvapadrapada Nakshathra. Aquarius (Kumba) is ruled by Saturn and
Poorvapadrapada is governed by Jupiter (Guru). Therefore, Saturn and Jupiter
must rule the time when it will materialise. Again lagna at which you put the
query is Libra (Thulam) and it is owned by Venus (Sukra). Therefore, the
present moment is Thula lagna and Poorattathi Nakshathra. Therefore, Sukra
Dasa, Sukra Bhukti, Guru Anthra will be the period when you will have it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But, there is another school of thought
that when Moon transits in a particular position, the native puts the query and
when the significators transit that particular degree the native will have that
ambition realised. Now Moon is around 22 in Aquarius. Therefore, on the day
when Sun or Sukra is in 22 of Aquarius, you will possess the house, i.e.,
around 5th March 1967. He did buy on 4-3-1967.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.12_HOUSE TO DWELL IN_5"><span lang="EN-US">DISPOSAL OF A HOUSE</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Horoscope:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu Dasa balance 0 year, 9 months, 13
days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During Moon Dasa, Saturn Bhukti on 6-2-1960
a new house was built and occupied. When can this building be disposed of?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Acquisition of a house: Judge the second,
fourth and eleventh bhavas.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Disposal of a house: 3rd, 5th and 10th
bhavas.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A building is indicated by the 4th house
counted from Lagna. Always count from Lagna. Never consider whether Moon sign
is strong or Lagna is strong. In the research after 1967 it was found that we
have to take always the Lagna alone. We should never Judge which is stronger
whether moon sign or Lagna. The main reason is that in a twin birth, only the
cusps of the house including ascendant change whereas Moon is in the same
position. What we had been following in K.P. printed in 1966, is to be given
up. Sun and Rahu are in second bhava. Mars and Venus are in the 4th and Jupiter
is in the 11th bhava. Stronger than Sun is Rahu as they are conjoined. Stronger
than Jupiter is Ketu as it occupies the sign ruled by Jupiter. Further, Ketu is
to give the results of Sun as it is aspected by Sun. Mars and Venus show
matters connected with buildings as they are in 4th house. Rahu's stars are
Arudhra, Swathi and Sathabisha. Sun alone is in Arudhra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="561" src="img/image030.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu governs Aswini, Makam and Moolam. Moon
and Ketu are in Aswini and Moolam. Mars rules Mrigasira trine stars-no planet
in any. Venus governs Bharani trine stars-no planet in any of the three stars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus owns 2nd house: Moon 4th house and
Saturn 11th house. No planet is in any of the three stars of Venus: None in the
three stars of Moon. But in the constellation of Saturn, Mercury is in Pushya.
Saturn in Anuradha and Jupiter in Uthrapathrapada. Hence, Mercury, Saturn and
Jupiter are for offering the results indicated by 11th house. Therefore, Moon
(in Ketu's star who represents Jupiter, strong in his own sign, occupies 11th
bhava and is in the constellation of lord of 11 Saturn) Ketu, Saturn, Rahu are
the strong significators to acquire own house; to occupy a new premises, etc.
Actually, you had a new house built for you during Moon Dasa, Saturn Bhukthi,
Rahu Anthra on 6-2-1960 - a Saturday ruled by Saturn who is the lord of the sub
period bukthi, Rohini star day governed by Moon, whose dasa was running.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For disposal, study the houses 3, 5 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury is in the 3rd house; no planet
occupies 5 or 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury's stars are Ashlesha, Jyeshta and
Revathi. Asilesha is occupied by Mars and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 3 is Mercury; lord of 5 is Sun and
lord of 10 is Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars and Venus are in Mercury's star; none
in Sun's star; Saturn, Mercury and Jupiter are in Saturn's star. Hence, Mars,
Mercury, Saturn, Venus and Ketu are strong significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, one can judge in the following
manner. Saturn as lord of 10 has the effect to cause the sale.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon, representing Ketu (as Moon was in
Ketu's star) in its dasa offered a building, as Ketu denotes 11th bhava
results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars, under the sway of Mercury, as it was
in Ashlesha, causes sale of a house in its dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, in Mars Dasa, Saturn Bukthi, Mercury
Anthra, you will enter into an agreement and during Mars Dasa, Saturn Bhukti,
Venus Anthra you will hand over the possession on a Dhanishta or Anuradha star
day. You can receive advance in the beginning of March 1967 and finish the sale
deed by June 1967.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As Mars is in the constellation of lord of
11 during Mars Dasa, there can be no desperate sale, but you will make up
