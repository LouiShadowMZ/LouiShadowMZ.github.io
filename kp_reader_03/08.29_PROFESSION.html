in 2 and 10: Mercury is in the 6th Bhava: Mercury's stars are Ashlesha, Jyeshta
and Revathi. No planet is in any of the 3 stars. Therefore take Mercury as the
strongest significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lords of 2, 6 and 10 are Mercury, Venus and
Saturn. Rahu is in Saturn's sign. Hence, take Mercury, Venus and Rahu as the 3
significators. 3, 9 and 12 indicate changes. Ketu and Moon in Ketu's
constellation, conjoined with Ketu are in 3. Saturn is in 9 in the
constellation of Moon. Therefore Moon, Saturn and Ketu show changes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury, Venus and Rahu indicate that you
will be attached to Sanitary Engineering or Public Health Engineering. You will
be dissatisfied when Moon (a planet for changes, contemplation, planning and
scheming)-dasa is on and dissatisfied when Saturn sub period operates. At the
same time Saturn does not give courage and confidence to kick off the job as it
is in its own sign and the wavering Moon's constellation, Sravana. Jupiter,
lord of 11, aspecting Saturn shows that friends and benefactors will suggest and
encourage you to entertain hopes. be optimistic especially when Jupiter Anthra
rules. Immediately after Saturn Anthra, Mercury follows which is in the
constellation of Saturn. Mercury in Mars sign gains courage though it is in the
constellation of Saturn. Moon brings about change in career. Mercury creates
chances. Mars fulfils his desire. Hence during Moon Dasa, Mercury Bhukti, Moon
Anthra he will leave the service and during Moon Dasa, Mercury Bhukti, Mars
Anthra he will start a business. Therefore he will leave the job in April 1969
in Ashlesha or Hastha Nakshatra day. He will take up business in May 1969 when
Mrigasira star second half will be transited by Moon. Mercury, Venus and Rahu
show that he will take up contract business connected with water supply
fittings. Mercury in a watery sign and in Scorpio, as the 8th sign of the
Zodiac and the 8th denotes lavatory, waste, squatting, etc. Does not 8th house
indicate in the part of the body, rectum and anus. Therefore one should take
that 8th house denotes water-closet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore he will quit the job and do
business. Mercury in 7, in the constellation of lord of 10 and 11 is very good.
Sub of Moon shows speculative income.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.29_PROFESSION_1"><span lang="EN-US">General rules followed by Westerners</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the Meridian or tenth cusp falls in,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) a fiery sign</span>—<span lang="EN-US">the

forecast by you regarding my Promotion as well as the Promotion of my
son-in-law and I am extremely thankful to you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I consulted you regarding my promotion
matters in the first week of January 1966. At that time my name was considered
for promotion to the post of Superintending Engineer from Executive Engineer
and for some reason or the other the proposal was shelved and I did not see any
reason for the case being reopened for consideration again. I was regular
reader of your esteemed magazine </span>“<span lang="EN-US">ASTROLOGY AND
ATHRISHTA</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> and it immediately struck me that you are
the only person who could tell me exactly what was going to happen to me. I
fixed up an appointment with you and met you. Sir, I was greatly pleased to
hear from you that I will receive my order of promotion on 1-2-1966; and
believe me exactly on that date I got my order. You also predicted that I would
take charge on 3-3-1966 on Thursday and Punarvasu star day since I was running
Rahu Dasa, Guru Bhukti. What an exactness in the date?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards my son-in-law, the prediction
about my son-in-law</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s promotion is discussed in the May
1966 issue of your esteemed magazine. Exactly as predicted, my son-in-law got a
better job on a salary of Rs.1800/- plus allowance in an Engineering firm at
Bombay in Sani Dasa soon after Mars Bhukti commenced. Sir, I am not able to
contain myself and I am not able to express my feelings in words regarding the
accuracy of your predictions. I do not know what more we require to prove the
truth of KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI. Also as one learned in both the systems of
Astrology </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Western and Hindu </span>–<span lang="EN-US">
I find that none can predict the date of event so exactly, giving out
satisfactory scientific explanations. I wish you, sir, a very long and
prosperous life so that you may enrich the sublime science more and enlighten
the public.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yours truly,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(Sd.) V.S. Ramaswamy</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.29_PROFESSION_2"><span lang="EN-US">PROFESSION_ PRINCIPLE-K.P.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the Hindu Traditional Astrology, we take
Brihat Jataka as the greatest authority and therefrom we quote and offer our
predictions. Then there are various books written by various authors and also
so many translations with their comments. Let me reproduce that which is
mentioned in the text-book Brihat Jataka as regards the acquisition of wealth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Count from the sign where your lagna falls
or where Moon was. Find out the tenth sign counted from these two signs, if
Moon is not in the lagna. If Sun occupies the 10th house counted from the
lagna, sign or Moon sign then one gets wealth through father; if Moon is so
deposited one gets from mother; if Mars, from foe; if Mercury from friend, if
Jupiter from brother; if Venus wife; if Saturn through inferiors.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The other rule is, note the ruler of the
10th house. Also find out in which navamsa sign it is deposited and not the
owner of the navamsa sign in which lord of the 10th house is situated; You</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="519" src="img/image056.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Balance of Moon Dasa at the time of birth
is 6 years, 2 months, 26 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Self-acquisition is judged from the houses
2, 6 and 10. So one has to consider the strength of the significators in the
following order:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. The planets in the constellation of the
occupants of the houses 2, 6 or 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. The occupant of these three houses 2, 6,
or 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. The planets in the constellation of the
lords of the houses 2, 6 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. The lords of these houses,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. The planets conjoined with the
significators, and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Those receiving aspect from the
significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Before proceeding further, it is necessary
to mention clearly what a Bhava-House is, and which planet is to be taken as
the lord of a Bhava-House.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A house commences from the cusp of a house
and ends with the succeeding cusp. The cusp of the ascendant is 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 00'. So the Lagna commences at 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 00'
Cancer. The next cusp falls at 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 56' cancer. Hence
Lagna Bhava is ruled by Moon. It extends from 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 00' to
26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 56' in cancer. Further Moon is also the lord of the
second house as the second cusp falls at 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 56'
cancer. The cusp of the 3rd house is 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 56' in Leo.
Hence the 2nd house extends from 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 56' cancer to 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 56' Leo. Even though only 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-4</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in Cancer happens to be in the second Bhava and 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 56' is the extension of the second house in Leo owned by Sun, the
lord of the second house for predicting finance, fortune etc. is Moon only.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, the traditional method of erecting
the Bhava Chakra </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Chaleeth as it is called in North
India </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> needs some consideration as it is misleading.
Suppose one's Lagna Bhava commences at 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in Cancer
and extends up to 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in Leo; also presume that the
planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> was in 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Cancer, the planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">B</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> was in 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Cancer and the planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">C</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> in 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Leo. In
the chart which is erected by the Hindu astrologers in Bhava-Chakra, they show
the planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> in Gemini, and
planets B and C in Cancer. It is misleading.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">No doubt planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> is in the 12th Bhava. Planets B and C are in Lagna Bhava. To
represent these clearly and correctly, it is advisable to follow the table as
under. should not forget to note that the 10th house that you have to count is
from (a) Lagna sign, (b) Moon sign, (c) and the sign occupied by the Sun. Hence
you have got three signs. So the tenth house will be three. The navamsa signs
occupied by them will be three. The owners of the signs occupied by the three
planets in rasi and in navamsa sign will be six. Then you should find out what
the lord of the navamsa sign indicates.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Sun indicates then one will make money
by dealing in grass, gold, wool, medicine and the like. If Moon is the lord of
the sign then one will gain through agriculture, pearls, fish etc. If it is
Mars, metallurgy, by violent actions, like fighting etc. If Venus one makes
money by dealing in gems, silver and cows and buffaloes. If Saturn, one will do
tiresome work, cooly in prison, dealing with criminals, etc. Again the author
emphasises saying that a person does such a work as is indicated by the owner
of the navamsa sign occupied by the lord of the 10th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">More or less in the same lines the other
books written by Hindu sages give us the knowledge to ascertain one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s profession. Actually the text books are not helpful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Twins are born. One is a medical person and
the other a lawyer, educationist. If we follow the tradition, you cannot
answer. You must and must fail. But follow K.P and You get the real answer.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.29_PROFESSION_3"><span lang="EN-US">Note the Meridian i.e._ the 10th Cusp</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord of the Meridian is in the
constellation of the planet in Aries, generally you are attached to the Army or
military or Police or Fire-brigade or any such job. In the boundaries you can
volunteer yourself to carry out the territorial work; otherwise you will be
inclined to use the nature of Mars and metal indicated by Mars who is the lord
of your sigh; that if you will manipulate with fire and also with metal, steel.
Many butchers, barbers, surgeons, chemists, gum-makers, cutlers, engine-drivers,
stokers, chauffeurs, smiths, cooks and all workers using sharp instrument or
using fire are governed by the sign Aries. Therefore, you would have in anyone
of the avocation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even though you are really one of the most
able executive types, yet it is advisable that you leave the management to
somebody else and you take up planning, scheming and putting through the same,
because you never stop working till you get exhausted; and also you take up
some other work while the previous one is half done. Therefore, you should be
above the manager directing others to carry on your ideas. You should pioneer
them. Do not think that other people cannot do the work as perfectly as you can.
Leave some of your work to them and try to reduce your amount of work which you
think that you should do yourself personally. If by chance, you are not the
head of the show but you accept a subordinate post, there will be a tendency
for you either to be insubordinate or to be undiplomatic with your higher
officials. If anyone would like to know your weakness then if you are given a
subordinate position, your weakness will be brought to the front. You are
really a leader to plan for new business and also apply your mind to produce
more or extend the existing industry. You ability is more to contemplate, plan
and scheme yourself; so leave the other work as regards administration,
organisation, etc. to others. Be-A-Pioneer. You hate to apply for any clerical
post or any secretarial post. You do not like to accept any routine work which
you have to carry on for long number of hours. You do not partake in any other
office affairs or strike or politics. If you are appointed as secretary in a
branch office, you can shine better than in any other place. You are an able
worker. You grasp the work of the whole business gradually and it is sure that
when time arises you will be able to run the whole show singly if needed. A
great defect in you is that while your work has been appreciated by the boss,
you thereby gain the confidence and also influence. Slowly you develop such a
mind to boss your boss. As an office manager you prove to be a good
disciplinarian and also an able administrator. As a salesman you will never allow
the customer to think for a minute but you will be going on talking so fast
that the customer will be convinced and he will make purchases. No person can
leave you without having some transactions with you. Any customer coming to
your business shop will totally miss to buy what he wanted to, but he will be
carried away by your ability. You will thrust on him those to your gains and to
his satisfaction. As an advertisement agent, you will prove to be an able
Director. As a tailor, you will have new designs and you can command a good
market. As a dealer in instrumental music, you will find successful commercial
artist and painter. You will be able to perform any duty far above average and
satisfy the customer. You find that work keeps you always alive as you find the
pleasure therein and you never get exhausted. You are a good mechanic; even any
new machine handed over to you for repairs, will be handled by you, will set
right whenever something goes wrong. You do not waste much time; you consider
that there is no charm in returning an article or a tool or machinery, after
delaying for a long time. You believe that speedy turnover and quick return
will be most welcome to the customer; you know that it increases the number of
customers. Some of you (unfortunate group) may take up an ordinary mechanic</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s post or an operator</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s post in an industry.
You may be most popular mechanic in that shop; but there can be no opportunity
when your ability is recognised and appreciated by the top person. So you may
not have your promotion when you expect it. You will prove to be unfit to hold
any such subordinate post.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you take up medicine or engineering or
law, you will shine. It is very important that you forget about your
independence, authority and superiority complex. You cannot be very blunt and
straight forward but you should develop diplomacy. Neither the customer nor the
executive head of the department where you serve, cannot relish such an
outspoken and blunt way of dealing with people. You should know how to move
with others; be patient. You should be smiling and encouraging them, otherwise
you cannot be a successful businessman. If you are tactful and diplomatic, you
will be the leader among the surgeons or among the advocates or the engineers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you take up the educational line you
have got very good opportunities to show your abilities. You are best fitted to
handle higher classes. You are capable of explaining things in a simple way and
demonstrate to them in the most impressive manner and give enough of practical
instructions. You are not fit to coach up students who are dull witted and very
slow to grasp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you take up independent business it is
absolutely necessary to have either a partner or immediately next to you an
assistant who will be offering advice, now and then and whenever you go at top
speed, he will retard it. You are so ambitious and also impulsive that you want
to do all the work in a very short time. Is it possible to put all the eggs in
one basket at one stroke? When you select the partner in business try to choose
the good natured person who is patient and persevering.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As a technician you will be very able to
carry out the work in a stylish way. Even a barber can be a very capable person
but his style in using the knife or the blade will threaten the customer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As a nurse, you will attend to the child or
the patient patiently for some time but if you are irritated, then you will
never hesitate to retort; normally this duty does not suit you but when once
you have passed this stage and you continue to be a nurse then you will be the
top most. As a housewife you should avoid to dominate and also to dictate; but
cultivate modesty and whenever something is to be done, you put forth your
suggestion in such a way that he thinks that the whole idea is his. This is the
way how you have to get happiness through such a person who will be less strong
minded than yourself. This is nothing but your tact and in a way without his
knowledge, you fool him. You can have greater pleasure in this life if you
prove yourself to be an excellent hostess by entertaining his higher officials
and friends. Actually your independent nature and irritant temperament must
vanish. You do not find much pleasure in moving with people and you do not want
to go to society and waste your time, so you will be using your leisure time on
useful hobby and in sports, to have health and peace.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When many jobs are mentioned for one sign,
how to select a few and thereby be useful to the querist.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You note the sub-lord of the meridian; the
lord of the constellation in which it is and the lord of the sign. Then you are
having three planets, i.e. the lord of the sub; its star lord and the sign
lord. This combination gives correct clue. It eliminates many and guides to
select a few.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Aries: Lord is Mars. If the other two

profession note whether if the sub-lord of the meridian is SUN, and the
Ascendant of the gentleman is Aries:-</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.29_PROFESSION_5"><span lang="EN-US">FOR ARIES-BORNS</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Sun is the significator of the first

your work efficiently and have harmony. You prefer to be independent and firm.
As a doctor you will prove to be good for treating cerebral cases, Neuralgia,
Coma and Head injuries. Avoid rash action.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Sun is the significator of the second
house, you will be industrious and you gain money by your work, hard work and
that too for long number of hours. You will deal in cash and you can serve in a

As a liar, you will be very clever in drafting false reports or writing
anonymous letters. You can thrive as an ambassador or messenger or one to
inspect the branches from the headquarters or to be a camp clerk or a tourist
guide. Hence travel, transport, sport and drama are advantageous. If the
sub-lord of the 10th cusp is Sun and he is also the significator of the 4th
house, you are best fitted to have your residential quarters and your office in
the same building. You can own boarding and lodging house or manage them. You
can prove yourself to be an expert in interior decoration. You can make fortune
