<h1 id="heading_06_A_LETTER_FROM_AN_AUSTRALIAN_ASTROLOGER_0"><span lang="EN-US">A LETTER FROM AN AUSTRALIAN ASTROLOGER</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mr. Krishnamurti,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I would like to thank you. I want to thank
you because after ten months search in India, I had at last found a man who
deals in the truth, the whole truth of the science of astrology. Right from
last November, I began searching for or studying the science of astrology. I
have met other experts and there are experts who have a great knowledge in
Madras, Bangalore, right up to the North and across to the East and I thought I
had met the best in this field of study, and I know I hadn't. Because now that
fortune has or the planets have introduced me to you, I know the cue or the
quintessence of what was searching for this science. Now I visited you at your
home on the recommendation of some one in a book shop after I had asked for
someone genuine in this science I came for ten minutes and stayed for three
hours. Then in the evening I attended your class (at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan)
which showed how much impressed I was. Even now I am with you in the thirty-six
hours of my stay in Delhi.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The way you conduct your class was probably
the most impressive thing to me because my experience with astrologers is that
nowhere does a man want to give away too much of science. It is occult. There
is this human element of secrecy that stops him from giving all. With you, that
does not apply. You give, and give as much as the student can absorb and 100%
more too. But the things is, you give, and you hold back nothing. You give for
the love of giving for the science that you love. And I thank you again because
I am going to receive from you for many years I can say, the pile of your
magazines I am taking with me to the hills.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Regarding your technique, this is
extraordinary thing. As I have said, I have studied under a number of
astrologers but I think the technique generally is the same. But yours is</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">extraordinarily different. It changes the
whole complexion and as a matter of fact, it fills-in the obvious blanks that
exist in the others. They are not consistent. Because we all recognize the
truth in the science, we make allowances, we stretch our imagination a little
to fill in the blanks. That should not be necessary in a science; because we
recognize basically the science; we do that fill in the blanks.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Your personal reading of my horoscope shows
also your great competence and the effectiveness of your technique and how
correct it is. You told me much of the past that others have told me and much
more than they told me and it was all correct. You told me about the present
and that too is correct. What you told me about the future, on the basis of
your predictions of the past and present, I can only assume that too will be
correct and another most impressive thing I must record here is the dexterity
with which you arrive to fix the periods and the times in your head as you read
the chart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Within a matter of minute, to my amazement,
you are able to elucidate those and which, what is more, prove correct. You are
convincing, you are clear and it has been a pleasure for me, if I can say this,
to study (your technique) at the peaceful hours I have on the hills. Thank you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">An Australian Astrologer</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">18-09-65</span></p>
