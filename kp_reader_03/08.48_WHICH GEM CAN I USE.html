<body><h2 id="heading_08.48_WHICH GEM CAN I USE_0"><span lang="EN-US">WHICH GEM CAN I USE</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Gems look like fragments of Heaven. They
are beautiful, costly and attractive. Their colours penetrate deeply like the
perfumeries. Some believe that by using the gem, the disclosed knowledge is
gained by divine grace or supernatural agency. Some believe that one can dodge
fate by using them. Such a superstition or belief was transmitted to us from
time immemorial. Thousands of years ago Aaron, the Priest of Israel used to put
on a breastplate in which 12 different gems were set and these 12 gems were assigned
to the 12 signs of the Zodiac, the pathway of the planets in the Heavens.
Nowadays most of the people use the gems mainly for two reasons. It is
beautiful and during the time of emergency it can fetch currency. Only some use
that particular Gem which will suit him or her so that they can have peace,
pleasure, prosperity and success. The fact is that the planets radiate
different colours. Each stone is sympathetic to the nature and vibrations of
each planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">AGATE: pleases God; confers wisdom and
eloquence; safeguards from deception; strengthens the heart; cures fever,
scorpion bites and snake-bites. Removes obstacles in receiving the legitimate
inheritances. AMETHYST is a preventive for the evil results of devils and
ghosts. If one keeps this gem in the water and drinks one will be cured from
sterility. If one drinks intoxicating liquid and spoils his or her health, by
using amethyst one will have his thoughts subdued and gradually give up drinks.
Health improves. Warriors become calm and act wisely even during danger.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">AQUAMARINE: It is very rare gem. It is
considered to be a pure one and it was generally given to the girls at the time
of their wedding with the belief that both of them can lead a happy and
harmonious wedded life. Some believe that Aquamarine prevents one from
suffering from the throat, liver and stomach. Musicians, wise people and those
who lack courage can have advantage by using Aquamarine.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">BERYL: Keep it in water and drink; mutual
affection will be increasing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">CORAL: It gives one courage, success in
litigation, cure from epidemic disease. It is a preventive for the evil effects
of devils and ghosts; it protects one from lightening and thunder.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">DIAMOND: No doubt a costly one; It makes
the wearer purer and more virtuous. It repeals poison, gives firm mind and
promises pleasant family life. If a lady puts it round her neck, safe delivery
is assured. Diamond also adds beauty to the person and protects the wearer from
many diseases.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Emerald: is used by chaste people. It
improves one's memory, retentive power and reproductive ability. Some believe
in grinding emerald to powder and give it as a curative measure for the bites
of venomous animals. Some administer it for dysentery, hysteria and epilepsy.
Some believe that one can discover any evil, as emerald will lose its
brilliance, if there is deception and treachery. Emerald is best suited for
those who undertake higher studies, overseas travel and foreign trade. It
increases domestic happiness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">GARNET: It is believed that this gem
protects one from poison and plague. It contributes for health and peace. It
saves one from lightening. There is also this danger in garnet. If a person is
not entitled by his birth sign to put garnet, it will bring misfortune. But if
a proper person uses it, it cures ulcer and inflammation. It improves the
business, increases the income and adds reputation as well as popularity. It is
auspicious for the married couple. One can be successful in his dealings with
the Government.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">OPAL: is generally used by astrologers and
such of those who want the power of foresight to enable one to predict. It also
improves one's ambition. It is helpful to form permanent tie of friendship. It
adds happiness to the married couple. Mediater to settle any dispute will find
success by using this gem. One can win in litigation and give fresh life to the
business. The brilliance of opal if effected by weather and by humidity
whenever it is brilliant and very bright, it is sure that the wearer comes by good
fortune.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">PEARL: Pearl is useful to preserve chastity
by wearing it round the neck.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">PERTH: (yellow colour): If a person holds
it firmly in his hand it will burn the hand. It is useful to cure gout.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">RUBY: It is good for gathering courage and
banishing gloom as long as it is bright. It will attract friends and offer good
fortune. If the luster is gone, misfortune will follow. Ruby drives out dirty
thoughts, give the mind to control passion, allowes one to preserve health. It
brings good cheer. It helps to form good friendship and also have permanent
love.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">SAPPHIRE: It has deep religious
significance. Even in olden days it was in use and king Soloman had it set in
his jewel. This is dedicated to God. It is useful to maintain harmony and good
relationship among the partners. Saints and pious people who would like to
concentrate, meditate and pray to God wear it for the realisation of their
ambition on the spiritual side. So it is good for fortune, peace and pleasure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">SARDONIX: This gem is a carved one. In it
some figure is generally engraved. It protects one from poisonous animals,
reptiles and insects. It is used as a curative when one suffers from infectious
disease. This Gem will be useful to form new good friend, improve self-control,
etc. It is also used by Lawyers, Actors, Orators and Educationists.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">TOPAZ: Topaz is the island in the red sea.
This gem was first of all found here. It works as a talisman to cure various
diseases including mental derangement, hysteria, madness, suicidal tendency,
etc. One becomes sane, generous and wealthy. It is also used in the necklace or
in the left arm. One becomes more brilliant and intelligent and leads a
peaceful pleasant and contented life. Dreams also will be pleasant. There will
be real attachment between husband and wife and each will be faithful to the
other.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">TURQUOISE: The meaning of this word is
Turkish. It was originally found in Turkey and taken to Europe, later. This is
very powerful in curing headache and reducing enimical activity. This gem will
also change its colour if either the health or life of the person who used it
or his life is in danger. As soon as the health is cured and the danger comes
to an end this Gem regains its original colour. It makes one generous,
magnanimous, liberal, dutiful, honest and be a Jupitarian.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which of the Gems can I use? Note the
sub-lord of the ascendant and that of the 11th cusp. Note which houses are
signified by them. If they are not at all connected in any manner with 6 or 8
or 12 then use that colour or that Gem which is indicated by the sub-lord of 1
or 11 or both. If the sub-lord of the ascendant or the 11th cusp happens to be
the significator of 6 or 8 or 12, reject the colour indicated by such a
sub-lord. Similarly one has to make selection of the colour and also the metal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If such a minute calculation could not be
done then one can note the sign in which the ascendant has fallen and one can
make his selection according to the Gems suitable for each sign as given below:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Aries       Amethyst,
Diamond</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Taurus    Emerald</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Gemini   Aquamarine, Agate</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cancer   Ruby</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Leo  (Ruby, Diamond) Sardonix</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Virgo      Sapphire</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Libra       Opal,

him then according to the nature of the planet he can use that Gem, which is
mentioned below:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun Ruby</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon     Pearl</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars      Coral</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury Emerald</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter    Topaz</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus     Diamond</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn    Sapphire</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu &amp; Ketu  Agate or Turquoise</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun Orange or dark red metal   Gold</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon     White, Silvery Silver</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercur   Slate colour Green Quick-Silver</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus     Yellow, Pale

governed by each planet is as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun Gold and Copper</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon     Silver</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars      Copper</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury Quick Silver</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus     Silver and

engagement of marriage? The significators of the house 2, 7 and 11 denote
marriage in their conjoined periods. But the planets which are the
significators of 2 or 7 or 11 is also the significator of 3 and also 9 the
marriage will be engaged in their conjoined periods. Because the third house
shows the agreement of the native and the 9th is the house which indicates the
consent and agreement of the other party.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. To proceed on deputation with increase
in emoluments: This shows that there is transfer, change in the surrounding,
colleagues, etc. and also increase in the income. Here the houses 5, 9 and 11
are to be judged. The significators of 11, will be the significator of the 12th
also, denoting life or service in a new place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Selection of a person for a higher post:
This selection will be given effect to either immediately or at a later date.
Yet that, one is selected for a post, is the decision of the appointing
authority and the news a good one to the native. Therefore one will hear about
the selection when the significator of 11 is also the significator of the third
house. Actual promotion will come when the conjoined periods of either the 2nd
or 6th or 10th and 11th operate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Confirmation in a post: It will be done
during the conjoined period of the planet which is deposited in the sub of the
planets in fixed sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. When will C.B.I. take action and find
secretly without our knowledge what crime we had committed </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> what bribe we have received or what illegal gratification was
received or and so on? Planets connected with your 10th and 12th house will
operate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. When will they take action and suspend
us? When the conjoined period of the planets connected with 5 or 9 and 12,
operate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. When will one person's desire be not
fulfilled in Horary? If the sub-lord of the 11th cusp is retrograde then only
whatever he desires to have will not be had. Ambition cannot be realised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. How to find out whether a man speaks
truth or not? Shakespeare has said </span>“<span lang="EN-US">The cheek is apter
than the tongue to tell an errand.</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> It means truth
makes the face of a person shine who speaks. It is the second house which
governs the face and also the tongue. If the sub-lord of the second cusp is
governed by Mars in any manner connected with Mercury one speaks untruth. If
the sub-lord is Saturn who is in any manner connected with Mercury then one
hides some news and thereby omits to mention. If the sub-lord is Mercury and no
other planet is connected with it, one gives the information in meticulous
detail. If Venus governs, he is the peacemaker. If Venus is connected with
Mercury, then as a peacemaker he will be clever to find out the strength and
weakness of both the parties. If Sun governs the sub of the second, one does
his duty nobly and never lies. Thus one is to find out whether one utters a
lie, whether carries the information and presents it correctly or how he
conducts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9. How to find out whether one will be
economical or one will be a spend-thrift? Note the sub-lord of the 2nd cusp. If
it is either Mars or if it is deposited in the constellation of Mars one will
be a spend thrift. If Mars is also the significator of the 10th house then he
will earn more and also spend more. But if the sub-lord of the second cusp is
Saturn one will be economical. One is overliberal and spends away much more
than one's income if the sub-lord of the 12th is Mars which is also connected with
Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10. Will I be bold enough to undertake this
job? First one should know whether what he does is right. If he finds it is
right and if he does not do it then he lacks courage. True courage is not the
brutal force; but is the firm resolve of virtue and reason. For this you should
judge the sub-lord of the third cusp. It shows consideration of pros and cons.
One can weigh the merits and demerits and then take a decision. True courage is
the result of reasoning. Resolution lies more in the head than in the veins.
Mental calibre and courage are shown by the third house. Consider the sub-lord
of the 3rd house. Any planet being the sub-lord of 3 is also the significator
of 2 or 10 or 11, one will surely undertake, do, come out successful and gain
thereby.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11. Who is contended and who is not? A poor
man wants only something and if they are given he is contended. The luxurious
person wants many things which he may or may not get. So he can't have
contentment. An avaricious man wants everything. So he will ever remain
discontented.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Contentment or otherwise depends on one's
mind. The fact is that the contented man is never poor whereas the discontented
person is never rich.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One should judge only the sub-lord of the
third cusp. One is never contented if the sub-lord of the third house is Mars.
Legitimate and reasonable ambition will be there. If the sub-lord is Jupiter,
Saturn shows no ambition at all. Nor it gives contentment. Lazy, sluggish
temperament or jealousy will be there. Thus we should judge from the nature of
the planets connected with the third cusp in the Horary chart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12. When can I get rid of the present
partner? Partner is indicated by the 7th house. Permanent tie is shown by the
11th house. The significators of the 6th house show when he will leave. The
significator of the 12th house indicate when you will drop him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also those significators of the 7th house
is in the sub of the significator of the 6th house one leaves in that period;
if the significator of the 7th house is in the sub of 12 partnership will be
broken by you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Or if the significators of the 7th also is
the significator of the 6th house then in its period one gets separated. But if
the significator of the 7th is also the significator of the 12th you sever
connection with him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, the significator of the 11th
house indicates</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">13. When can I heave new partner in
business? You can have a new partner when the period of the planet signifying
the 7th house is also the significator of the 11th house and the significator
of the 11th should be connected with 2nd or 10th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Or the significator of the 7th house should
be in the sub of the 11th house and the 2nd or 10th.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">14. Will I meet with any accident in my
journey? You have to consider the 3rd house for the journey, if it is for a
short duration and the 9th house for a journey of long duration. If the
significator of the 3rd house for short journey and the significator of the 9th
house for a long journey happen to be the significator of the houses 6 and 8
one must meet with an accident. The injury will need hospitalisation if it is
also the significator of the 12th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">15. When will my tenant vacate? 6th house
indicates tenant. The 4th and 11th counted there from, denotes the occupation
of your house. If he is to vacate, the 3rd from the 6th should operate. Hence
the significator of the 8th (3rd from the 6th) should, be connected with the
6th, i.e. the significator of 6 also. Hence during the conjoined period of such
of the significators of both 6 and 8 he must vacate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">16. When can I get a tenant to my newly
built house? When you run the conjoined period of the significators of 6, 4th
from the 6th i.e. the 9th and the 11th from 6th, i.e., the 4th conjointly
operate. That is, the significator of 6, 9 and 4 must rule conjointly a time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">17. Am I the first person whom the other
person loves? If the lord of the sign, lord of the star and the lord of the
sub, of the 8th cusp is your ruling planets at the moment of your birth, then
you are not the first. You will be </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">N</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> plus 1. You can request the other person if you decide to marry
him, to stop with </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">N</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> plus one
and do not add any more. But if the lord of the sign, the star and the sub of
the Ascendant happen to be the ruling planets of yourself at the moment of your
birth then you are the first person. One thing you should also know. From your
query the astrologer can find out whether you were in love with anybody else.
How, Sir? If the star lord, sign lord and sub-lord of the second cusp happens
to be the lover's ruling planets at the moment of his birth, then you had
already intimacy with another person. This person will be </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">N</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> plus 1 to you. Oh God? Then to consult an
astrologer is dangerous. Really if one wants to keep his or her secret
activities within himself or herself then for them an astrologer is dangerous
as per your term. I have borrowed so much that the liabilities are much more
than my assets. Now the creditors bring pressure on me every moment. What shall
I do? Do not consult astrologer at this stage. Go to the court and have relief
by filing an insolvency suit after necessary arrangements, etc. with your
advocate and friends. Astrologer ought to have been consulted before you
borrowed. Then you would have been given proper advice. He knows that poverty
is hard but debt is horrible. It is a horror to be going on borrowing like some
speculators. To live in a smoky house with ants, cockroaches, rats, scorpion,
bugs, mosquitoes and flies or to live with a scolding and violent wife is much
better than to live on borrowing. You lose your liberty. When you return home
late in the night, your wife submits a list of the creditors who were waiting
till late in the night and narrate all what they told. She will exaggerate
also. You will be ashamed to see the creditors. You avoid taking the route
passing through the creditor's house or office, with great fear you talk to him
if accidentally you are met by him. You have to make poor pitiful sneaking
excuses. It leads you to utter falsehood and speak lie without any admixture of
single truth. Your spirit and virtue are deprived. You are like a squeezed
orange. How can it maintain its beautiful shape? Rather you will be like an
empty bag. How can you stand erect? Do not you know that out of debts, is out
of danger. That is, debt is said to be a danger to one. Hence before proceeding
to borrow consult an able astrologer. He will suggest you a time to take the
cheque from the creditor, so that loan will not multiply and you will come by
fortune to repay that which you have borrowed on the advice of the astrologer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Is 8th house ever evil? It is said that
the 8th house indicates receipt of gifts, legacy, money of the deceased,
unearned income, insurance, bonus, gratuity, provident fund, arrears of pay,
entangled money, etc. Also it is said that the repayment of loan is indicated
by the 8th house. If the period of the planet owning and occupying the 8th
house operates, will I receive money or will I issue cheque towards the loan
amount which I borrowed?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8th house is the second to the 7th and 7th
house indicates those with whom you transact. Either he who pays you or he who
receives from you, both are indicated by the 7th house. The 8th house shows the
money of the person with whom you transact.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the significator of the 8th house is
also the significator of the 12th house, then you issue the cheque and the
other person puts the cheque in his bank. If the significator of the 8th house
is also the significator of the houses 6 and 11, then he gives (6th) and you
gain (11th). Therefore, the significator of 8 and 12 show repayment of loan or
lending loan whereas the significator of 6, 8 and 11 indicates gain of money.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) 8th and 12th houses indicate the
imprisonment: Is it not? Unless the third house operates imprisonment will
never take place. Imprisonment or confinement in prison means you leave your
permanent place of residence and you make a short journey. Therefore 3, 8 and
12 indicate imprisonment. Detention in one's own house is judged from the house
4, 8 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Will I submit thesis for Ph.D.? You can
submit thesis for Ph.D. only when the conjoined period of the significators of
4 and 9 operate. If the significators of 9 is also the significator of 11, you
pass; you get the Doctorate. But if the significator of 9 is the significator
of 12 you cannot come out successful in your attempt. Again, if you add
something more and submit again because of Saturn's connection then if the
period of the significator of 9 and 11 operates you will get through.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Sir, you say that 11th house indicates
success in the examination. When the 4th house show study, then is not the 11th
house 8 to the fourth? Correct. If you pass the examination because of the 11th
house significator, does it not mean that the course of study you had due to
the fourth house significator ends? Can you study again the same course when
you have completed once?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) According to you, 5th house is gain to
the opponent, but you say that 5th house significator must operate to make
money by speculation. How do you reconcile?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the significator of 5 (giving you the
mind, money and opportunity to speculate) is also the significator of 6 and 11
you gain in speculation. But if the significator of 5 is the significator of 8
and 12 you lose. 5th house shows the mode of gain or loss. The other houses
indicate how you fare.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(6) How to declare that one cannot have a
child at all? Ask for a number within 249. Erect a map for that latitude of the
place of judgement. Note the sub lord of the 5th cusp. If it is the
significator of 2 or 5 or 11 he will have a child. But if the sub lord of the
5th cusp is the significator of 1 or 4 or 10 he can never have a child at all.
Houses 1, 4, 10 are detrimental to the birth of children, being the 12th
(negation) to houses 2, 5 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(7) Can I publish a book? You must put the
query in the following manner. Will I be able to write a book? Will I complete
the manuscript? Then you should know will I publish. Hence you should ask for 2
numbers. The first will refer to the completion of the book. The second number
will indicate whether you can print and publish. One can complete writing a
book if the significator of the third and the 11th houses operate and Mercury
is in any manner connected with them. It can be published if Jupiter is one of
the planets connected with the third and the 11th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One can print it only when Mars and Mercury
are connected with the third and the 11th house. Hence the above rule is
applicable both to the natal horoscope and to the horary chart. If you take it
as a business, then the significator of 3 should also be the significator of
the 10th house. Even to write articles and hand them over to the publisher, one
should have the significator of 3 to be the significator of 10 also. 10th house
is for earning some money or for having the publicity, or for becoming popular.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(8) Tap water from a well: I want to have a
well sunk. I should get water even during drought season. Where and when can I
drive a borewell?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First you should know whether you would be
going on spending and continuing to drive the borewell till you tap the subsoil
water-bearing strata; if it is very deep whether you will patiently preserve or
not. Then only the question arises whether you will have it and if so at what
depth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Natal Astrology will not help you much.
Take Horary. Ask for a number. Query is to be taken as </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Will my desire to tap water, within my means be fulfilled?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) It is said that in the year Paridhabi
there will be much of dearth for water. If you want to have water at all times,
then it is better to have a well erected in this year as you can go very deep
into the earth and never it will get dried up because you operate when the
subsoil water bearing strata will be at the bottom most level.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Whenever Saturn is in Sathabisha or
Ashlesha or Jyeshta or Moola, there will be less of rain and hence the
water-bearing strata will go down. At that time you can dig.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Again select that year when the year
lord is Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you would like to know where to make a
bore and at which depth you will get water, you read Brihat Samhita Chapter 54
on the finding of water springs. There are 125 slokas. These give an idea of
finding out a place where you can have a well and at what depth you can get
water. Also it tells you whether the quantity of water will be copious or not.
It also gives you information whether the water will be wholesome, potable and
palatable or not. When one goes through all the rules, he will find that it cannot
be used where the land is without a plant or tree or anthill. Only when one
goes through these slokas, one can realise the difficulty. Further one should
try these rules, verify and then give one's opinion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But what I had been doing and I do nowadays
is as follows: Ask for a number between one and two hundred and forty-nine. If
the sub-lord of the 11th cusp or the lord of the constellation in which the
sub-lord of the 11th cusp was situated, were to be in a watery sign, one will
tap, water. If it is in a barren sign, one cannot tap water. He will leave it.
If the sub-lord is deposited in the constellation of Moon or Venus or Mercury,
one will get water quickly. If Moon is in any manner connected with Jupiter then
there will be copious supply. If Moon is connected with Venus, the water will
be sweet and palatable. If Moon is connected with Saturn then the spring will
not be sufficient enough to maintain the head and the level of water will fall
down quickly, so that one should resort to intermittent pumping. If Saturn and
Mars are connected with the sub-lord then there will be free ammonia and much
of nitrites threatening that the water has been recently polluted; if it is
connected with Mars alone there will be iron in the water; though at the time
of pumping the water may appear to be clear, in a few minutes it will turn to
be red due to the formation of ferric salts. If Moon is connected with nodes
there will be much of sulphates so that the water is both brackish and also
there would be much of permanent hardness thereby total solids will be beyond
permissible limits. If Saturn and Sun are connected with Moon, the flourine
content will be more than 1 part per million and continuously drinking such a
water will cause mottled enamel, overgrowth of bones, rigid bones, indigestion
and rigid vertebral column. If Mercury is connected with the sub-lord, one will
have another well also sunk so that there will be plurality of wells. The depth
at which one can get, cannot be predicted by me. It is just like asking how
many miles will I travel. Is it long journey or short journey? Are we to
consider the distance or the time taken to cover the distance? One will be able
to go to Bombay and come back to Delhi before one who goes to a village near
Meerut and come back. Astronauts went to Moon and returned before the train
leaving Delhi arrived at Madras in that week. Here who has made short journey,
and who has gone a long journey. Similarly, one may take days to blast the rock
and find out water at a depth of 30 feet whereas another can find water even 40
or 50 feet below the ground level and he can tap water much earlier than the
other person, who has to bore through the rock. Therefore, it is possible to
say whether one can get water with less of exertion or after great efforts.
Research must be done to find out the exact depth where one can find water.
Sub-soil water level, will be gradually changing according to season.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(9) Which child will help me in my last
days? With whom will I live? One may have many children and none may help. So
the query should be whether I will be a dependant on my children in my old age;
if so which of my children will support me. It is both from the natal horoscope
and horary one can find out whether one will have sufficient finance in his old
days to meet his expenses or one will borrow or have the deficient amount
supplemented by the children or friends.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To know which child will support, one has
to note down the dasa and bhukti running. These planets offer the results of
the lord of the constellation in which they are deposited. Hence note down the
dasa lord, bhukti lord, the lords of the constellation where they were at the
time of birth in the birth chart. That child who has born with such ruling
planets at the time of his birth who happen to be the dasa lord or bhukti lord
or the lords of the constellation where the dasa lord and bhukti lord were situated,
will support, provided they are advantageous to you, promising help; but if the
dasa and bhukti indicate separation then there will be separation from that
child then. In the same dasa ruled by a planet, one child may invite the father
to the place of his residence depending on his job. He can keep him and be of
great assistance during a particular bhukti. When the bhukti changes the son
will show negligence silence and reluctance, and the father will feel
embarrassed to further stay. It means the previous bhukti lord promises help
whereas the next bhukti lord indicates withdrawal of support. Both the lord of
the bhukties will be the ruling planets of that son or daughter, indicating
what one experiences through that individual i.e., son or daughter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, in a particular dasa a fellow
marries a girl. They live happily. But in the same dasa in another bhukti or
anthra, there is difference of opinion; dispute arises and both get separated.
This is shown by that sub-lord who operates, whereas dasa lord has both
portfolio; i.e. wedding and also separation. If the sub-period is ruled by the
planet connected with harmony and life with wife, then he lives together and
her ruling planets at the time of her birth will be the lords of the dasa
bhukti or the lords of the constellation in which they are deposited. When
separation comes, he get separated with the same lady. Therefore now also the
period that runs will be governed by her ruling planets; but the sub-period
lord will be the significator of 6 or 10 or 12. Therefore, one has to take into
consideration the ruling planets of a person with whom we will be friendly or
not, who will lend support or not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10. Will that person vote for me or vote
against me? Note the ruling planets of the person about whose action you doubt.
If his ruling planets are to support you, i.e., if they happen to be the
significator of 6 or 11 you can be sure that he will vote for you. You need not
doubt. But if the ruling planet of that person is the significator of your
houses 5 and 12 he will vote against you. If the planet is the significator of
both 11 and also 12, then find out the sub sub-period which is to run for you.
If the sub sub-period lord is connected with 6 or 11 you are sure to get his
vote. But if the sub sub-period is ruled by a planet which is the significator
of 5 or 12 in that sub sub-period he will vote against. Have we not seen people
who support one now and then the other. It is not his or her wish. It depends
on the period which one runs. Therefore the readers should note that the events
change according to the lord of the dasa, bhukti, anthra etc. and such an
advantageous or disadvantageous results can be had through the friendship or
enmity of the person depending on his ruling planets and the houses to which
they are the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11. While comparing the horoscopes of bride
and bridegroom, how to predict that this boy will marry only this girl or
whether this girl will marry only this boy?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Answer: - First of all erect the horoscope
according to my instruction. Judge individually all the horoscope and find out
the time of wedding. When the time of marriage of both agree then there is the
likelihood of both getting married. But if a chart shows that for years the
marriage cannot come up but either of the two will get married now, reject that
chart which indicates late marriage on a different date.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note the significators of marriage in all
the charts. If either is running A dasa, B bhukti and C anthra, note whether A,
B and C are the ruling planets at the moment of the birth of the other; or the
planets deposited in the constellation of A or B or C will be the ruling
planets at the moment of the birth of the partner. This is a certainty.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When a child is born, the father runs A
Dasa B Bhukti C Anthra and the mother X Dasa Y Bhukti and Z Anthra. The child
will have the ruling planets at the moment of the birth which will agree with
the period which the father and the mother run or those deposited in the
constellation of the dasa lord, bhukti lord and anthra lord. This rule also
will never fail.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For a business you may be in search of a
partner. A few may come forward. You have to make the selection as follows. Or
you will select as follows. When do you take a partner? What are the planets
ruling this period? Either these planets or those are deposited in the
constellation of these Lords must be his ruling planet. If the other party's
ruling planet is not one of the signicators according to your chart then he
cannot be your partner. Finally, follow Horary astrology as expounded by me.
Ruling planet at the moment of judgement will correctly guide.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12. Sir, how to find out why a marriage
which was about to be settled was prevented from fructifying?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Horary astrology the querist gives a
number and you calculate the nirayana position of the lagna. Exactly 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> away is the seventh cusp. The sub-lord of the 7th cusp should be
the signficator of the houses 1, 6, 10 or 12. It shows that the marriage will
not take place with the party in question. If the sub-lord is not only the
significator of 1 or 6 or 10 or 12 but also the signficator of 2, then the
marriage is stopped due to want of money to meet the expenses. It is mainly due
to lack of means. If the sub-lord of 1 or 6 or 10 or 12 is also the sub-lord of
the 3rd house, then the marriage is dropped due to interference of neighbours
or cousins or due to any information received by the other party, against the
interest of the querist. If the sub lord of 1, 6 or 10 or 12 is also the
sub-lord of the 4th house, then the mother is on the way of fixing the
marriage; or it may be due to disagreement in giving a house or estate or
vehicle. If the sub-lord is also the significator of the 5th house; then the previous
love affairs of the querist will be brought to light and due to his bad
reputation, the marriage will not take place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord is the significator of 1
and 6 then the marriage may be stopped due to ill-health of the querist, being
known to the other party, or the maternal uncle will play foul game or servants
may do mischief or the secret enemy of the other party may carry tales against
the querist.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord is also the significator of
the 7th, then on hearing that a law suit pending against the querist, the other
party will disagree. If the sublord is also the significator of the 8th house,
then the marriage is stopped as the querist does not get as much dowry as he
demands from the other party. Or it may be due to the death of the relative
which will be taken as an ill-omen.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord is also the significator of
the 9th, marriage will not take place as the party could not come in time and
he does not get leave or is in a foreign country and could not come, or one's
examination will be taking place, or the relations of the other party will stop
it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord is the significator of both
1 and 10, then the wedding does not come through due to the interference of
elders or officers or superiors, or due to his professional status which in the
eyes of the other party is inadequate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord of these houses 1 or 6 or
10 or 12 is also the significator of the 11th house, the marriage is stopped
due to the interference of friends or elder brother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord of the 12th is also the
sub-lord of 1, then it is certain that there is some tale carrying, and secret
enemies hover round making false propaganda. So the marriage does not come up.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.48_WHICH GEM CAN I USE_1"><span lang="EN-US">Why Lagna alone is considered</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Sir,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I find in your Magazine, that since a
couple of years, you are not suggesting that the Moon sign should be taken in
case the lagna is afflicted and Moon sign is not. Why?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Answer: Sir, I had been following the above
method of taking the unafflicted ascendant or Moon sign, But in my research,
only in 1965 end, I understood that when twins are born, Moon does not move
even a single minute, whereas the lagna alone moves and when the research on
the sub-lord came out successful to read out the diametrically opposite results
among the twins, I have given up the idea of taking Moon sign, in case lagna is
afflicted. It needed reconsideration. So, we must, whether lagna is afflicted or
not, take only the exact position of lagna. If the lagna is afflicted, then the
horoscope has certain defect, and simply because there is that defect, we
should not jump to Moon sign which is auspicious. After having found out this,
I have stopped writing in the above manner, mentioned by you. Therefore, I
request all the readers to take only the lagna and never the Moon sign, whether
lagna is afflicted or not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Not only the lagna is important, but the
exact position of all the 12 cusps are also important, to note the advantageous
or disadvantageous results signified by the houses </span>–<span lang="EN-US">
Bhava. The sub lord of the cusp above offers correct solution of that house.
The significators show the time of event when the matter will be favourable or
not.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.47_ABOUT DRESS.html">← ABOUT DRESS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.48_WHICH GEM CAN I USE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.49_ROAD TO SUCCESS.html">ROAD TO SUCCESS →</a></div></body>
