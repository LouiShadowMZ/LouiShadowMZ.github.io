contractor on 14-10-67 requesting him to construct a building for my use at a
cost of Rs. 50,000.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I paid Rs. 6,600 on 29-6-61, secondly on
14-10-68; Rs. 10,000, thirdly on 21-12-68 Rs. 7,000. The balance is to be paid.
Source and date of repayment, God alone knows" says one student.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Why do you say that God alone knows.
Cannot our Guruji tell you when and how you will repay and regain peace."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes. He can help us by
prediction."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Then what do you expect from an
astrologer. One classmate may consult about when he will get married. Since he
is depressed and dejected as he remains unmarried and he had his 37th birthday,
only yesterday. Will the astrologer relieve his worry or satisfy him by giving
any of his aged daughters in marriage to him? Or if I go and say that there is
pressure for money etc, which you are aware of, will he issue a cheque and help
me? If our room mate requests him to find out when he can get accommodation,
will he make a search for him. Astrologer can give only this much relief. That
is he can remove the worry. How? He will predict when the matter will
materialise. "Alright let us meet him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Both enter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yes: come in, come on; Why do you
hesitate?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Sir, we have not taken an
appointment, but we have taken a chance".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"What for?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The worried person narrates the cause of
his worry and asks "when can I be free from these, by paying the
Balance?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Have you brought your
horoscope?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes, Sir here it is. I have worked
out as per your method.'</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Horoscope is as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="562" src="img/image039.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus Dasa balance 15 years, 9 months 27
days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is verified. An intelligent student,
without a single mistake has calculated and erected the map according to
Krishnamurti Padhdhati.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"The chart is perfectly alright. Give
me few minutes"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Two minutes passed. I made all calculations
and I wrote the dates of repaying in a slip of paper.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I asked him "What is the time,
now?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"10-20 A M. Sir."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"What is the lagna?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Let me refer to Tables of Houses and
tell you, Sir".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes, Tables of Houses furnishes
correct information. There is the ready reckoner. Please refer."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Mesha started at 9-38 A.M. Sir. So it
is Mesha."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Who is the owner of Mesha?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Mars Sir"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"What is your day of birth?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Tuesday"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Who governs Tuesday?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Mars"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Next, where is Moon now?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"In Taurus"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Who is its Lord?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Venus"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"What is your birth star?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Poorvashada"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Who rules Poorvashada?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Venus Sir"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"You are the third person visiting
now."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Do you see that your lord of lagna is
Mars, lord of your star is Venus"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes Sir."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"What did I teach you in the
class?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"You said that one can consult an
astrologer only at such a time so that the ruling planet at that moment agrees
with the ruling planets at his or her birth moment."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Are you satisfied with the
correctness of your chart?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes Sir."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Now, let me tell you, the next date
of repayment will be 15-3-69".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"How did you arrive at it in 2
minutes, Sir."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If I explain, it will take 15 minutes.
Anyhow let me oblige, you both.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What do you mean by an agreement with
contractor. Does it not mean that you and another person sign a document
wherein both agree. So which houses are we to judge. 3rd house counted from
your lagna and 3rd counted from 7th i.e. houses 3 and 9 in your chart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3rd house is vacant: Owner is Mercury. It
has no planet in its stars Ashlesha, Jyeshta or Revathi. So Mercury is one of
the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter, Moon and Mercury are in the 9th
house: Mercury, we have judged. Venus alone is in Moon's star. Saturn is in
Jupiter's star. So Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Moon, Jupiter are the significators.
Indude Rahu and Ketu also as it represents Jupiter &amp; Mercury respectively.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What was the period running at the time of
signing the contract? Moon Dasa, Venus Bhukti, Saturn Anthra, Venus Shookshma.
The day was a Saturday. The star was Saturn star. The time of signing the
contract was Makara sign, Moon star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Next you paid first installment. Houses 8
and 12 indicate the repayment, just like 2 and 6 when judged together, denote
borrowing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You repaid during the Moon Dasa, Sun
Bhukti, Saturn Anthra on a Saturday when Moon was in Cancer owned by itself.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Next payment was made during Mars Dasa,
Mars Bhukti, Mars Anthra, Rahu Shookshma on a Monday in Rahu constellation in
Mercury sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The third was paid on 21-12-1968 during
Mars Dasa, Mars Bhukti, Saturn Anthra on a Saturday when Moon was in Makara
ruled by Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"How is it, Sir, that Saturn gives me
money and also makes me part with it?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In your chart, Saturn owns both 11th and
12th houses: No planet is in 12; Saturn alone is in 11. No planet is in Saturn
star. Hence Saturn gives, due to 11th house and repays due to 12th house
result. So, on the days governed by Saturn, you get cheques and also, you issue
cheques.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Can I pay in full?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"No."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Whenever Saturn rules, all payments
will be made only in installments."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Why, Sir."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Saturn indicates disease, Saturn gives a
chronic one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If we get or give, Saturn prolongs the
period by way of installment. It is a delaying planet to fulfil one's desire
whereas it is not denying nor disappointing one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When will I clear off the loan?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Mars Dasa Rahu Bhukti Sun Anthra </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> January 1970."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Will he give me time to that
extent?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether he gives or not, you clear off only
when the conjoined period of planets, deposited in the constellation of planet
in 8 operates; Judge the house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Thanks, Sir."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Both go smilingly and with the hope that he
can repay and clear off in January, 1970 and with a decision to take time from
the contractor.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Is your worry over?" asks the
classmate, while they are putting on shoes sitting in the outside verandah</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"What doubt is there? He deals with
the subject so quickly, explains it in meticulous detail so lucidly and
encourages with his convincing arguments so confidently". So saying they
go on and I can't hear any more that they talk.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.16_SHALL I OWN A CINEMA THEATRE_ IF SO_WHEN.html">← SHALL I OWN A CINEMA THEATRE_ IF SO_WHEN</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.17_WHEN CAN I CLEAR OFF LOAN">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.18_DISEASE.html">DISEASE →</a></div></body>
