Sun in the Heavens. The planets and the other luminary Moon, follow their own
individual tracks which lie along the ecliptic on north and south of it. This
width on either side is about 7</span>½°<span lang="EN-US"> and hence the pathway
of the planets is around 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in width, having the
ecliptic in its centre. This is called the Zodiac.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If one observes, it will appear that the
whole Zodiac goes round the earth once a day, i.e., once in 24 hours and the
same portion of the Zodiac rises in the east in 23 hours 56 minutes and few
seconds.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the Zodiac is divided into 12 equal
parts called Solar mansion (sign or rasi) (Mesha-Aries to Meena </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Pisces), each division will be appearing in the east, roughly for a
duration of 2 hrs. In other words, the previous sign will appear to rise up in
the heavens and the next sign will commence to rise nearly two hours after the
previous sign began to rise. Hence the 12 signs rise in the east, roughly at an
interval of 2 hours.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Hindu astrologers have subdivided each
sign into two halves and called such a division as a Hora. Hence roughly one
hour is needed for each Hora to rise in the east or pass through the Meridian.
But the Hindu astrologers, in olden days did not calculate the time in hours
and minutes. They used to measure in Ghatis and Vigatis or Naligai and Vinadi.
Hence a day is of 60 Ghatis. Hence each sign is approximately 5 Ghatis and half
a sign or a Hora will be about 2 </span>½<span lang="EN-US"> Ghatis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Pharos in Chaldean star lord says: In
remote and ancient Chaldean the knowledge of the stars and the framing of the
Zodiac were the results of the Divinely Inspired Gifts to the wise men. The
books of Genesis, the Mosaic Era, the Babylonic and Hindu Empires were
non-existent when the Chaldean sages laid down the axiom that </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Obstral spheres exert continual influence on terrestrial life.
Chaldeans followed the Hora and found out the influence of the planets over the
affairs of the people. Also it was said that certain hours are advantageous for
certain matters and certain hours are unfortunate for some affairs. This method
of prediction is called </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Hora</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Hindus</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> also were aware that certain matters thrive in some hours (i.e. 2 </span>½<span lang="EN-US"> Ghatis periods) and some fail in certain hours (2 </span>½<span lang="EN-US"> Ghatis periods).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Both the Hindus and the Chaldeans do not
follow the same calculations to find out which planet rules a particular time
though the order of the planets is the same.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First, let us know something about the days
and then about the hour or otherwise called </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Hora</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The names of the days are derived from both
the luminaries and the other five planets, e.g. </span>–</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sunday </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Tamil
(Nyayiru) Telugu (Adhivaram) others </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Bhanu varam, Ravi
varam etc. in India. Planet in English (Sun), Tamil-Suryan, Sanskrit-Ravi,
German-Sonnag(Sonne), Dutch Zondag (Zon).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Monday </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Thingal,
Somavaram, etc. in India. English (Moon). German Montag (Mond), French Lundi
(Lune), Italian Lunedi (Luna), Dutch Maandag (Maan) etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Tuesday </span>–<span lang="EN-US">
Sevvai-Mangalvar etc. English (Mars), French Mardi (Mars), Italian Martedi
(Mars).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Wednesday </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Bhuda;

(Venus).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturday </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Sani,
Mandha, English (Saturn), Dutch Zaterdag (Saturn).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The results signified by the planets do
predominate in the above order. Hence the names of these days are arrived at
according to the effects agreeing with the particular planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Probably, the same effects repeat once in 7
days and hence only seven days in the week are fixed; e.g., on Sunday some
matters flourish; on Monday some other affairs thrive and after 7 days the same
matters have advantage on Sundays, Mondays, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards the Hora division, the Hindus do
not take the time of sunrise for their calculations. They follow strictly
according to the time mentioned below.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="812" id="图片 1" src="img/image088.jpg" width="550"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From the table it may be observed that the
planets rule the hours in an order which is the alternate days in the reverse
order. Suppose Sun rules a particular hour. Then note in the reverse order, the
days of the week. The alternate one is Friday ruled by Venus. Hence Venus rules
the hour, after that of the sun. Similarly, Thursday is before Friday and
Wednesday is the alternate one in the reverse order to Friday. Wednesday is
ruled by Mercury. Hence Mercury rules the hour after Venus. Thus the order of
the hours is worked out.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It will be a pleasant surprise to note that
after 24 hrs. that planet which rules between 6 and 7 A.M. is the same planet
which governs the day. Therefore, irrespective of sunrise, the locality and the
part of the year in which one wants to find the planet ruling a particular
time, simply refer to the above table.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But Westerners and Chaldeans calculate in a
different manner. They divide the interval between the time of sunrise and noon
into 6 equal parts and each will be little more or less than an hour depending
upon the interval between sunrise and noon. Similarly the interval between moon
and sunset is divided into 6 equal parts. Likewise, the time from sunset to
midnight and from midnight to sunrise is worked out.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But the order of the planet ruling the
first hour (a little more or less according to this calculation) is ruled by
the lord of the day. The other hours are ruled by the other planets in the same
order as is followed by the Hindus. Only the duration of each planetary hour
division varies. (Readers are also expected to note that the Hindus adopt this
hora division in an arbitrary manner and it has no connection with the rising
of the sun Hora or Moon Hora in the East. Kala Hora or planetary hours are different
from Hora division of a solar sign.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then, the doubt arises whether the hours
mentioned are the standard time or the local meantime.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What is an astrological day? It is the
interval between the sun-rise on a day at a particular locality to the next
succeeding sunrise. As a planetary hours commence from the time of sunrise
which varies according to the Latitude and Longitude of the place, one is to
take the timings in the local meantime.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As we to take that each planet rules
exactly one hour or are we to find out the interval between sun-rise and noon
and divide it by 6, likewise noon to sunset, sunset to mid night and midnight
to sun-rise? So, a research was necessary to ascertain which is to be followed.
The Modern Astrological Research Institute has found that the second method is
correct and the one hour systematic division needs modification.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sun rises in the northern latitudes,
according to the season, any time between 4.30 a.m. and 7.30 a.m. If one is to
consider that a day commences from sunrise and the first hour is governed by
the lord of the day, then one is to follow the Chaldeans and should not follow
the table published in almanacs etc., which is also reproduced in this article
to learn and unlearn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, planetary hours will be exactly
one hour, throughout the world only on two days in a year, i.e., when Sun
passes the vernal and autumnal equinoxes on or around 22nd March and 23rd
September. On other days, the duration of each planetary hour varies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When one calculates the interval between
sunrise and noon, divides by six and takes the first portion as the hora of the
Lord of the day, it does not matter whether it is Local Mean Time or Standard
Time. It is preferable to follow Standard Time, as the clocks are set to Indian
Standard Time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further division of the day will be the
division of the Hora. To trace the exact time when the various events in the
planetary hours governed by different planets occur, it is necessary to know
not only the main division day and night called Hora hours or planetary hours
but also the subdivision of the planetary hours of different duration.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose one wants to note the time when
Saturn will rule its hour on Wednesday, so that one can avoid (a) to sign an
agreement in that period or (b) to fix the marriage during that time or (c) to
meet a person to negotiate any transaction etc. Adopt the following principle:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) What is the Indian Standard Time of
sun-rise in that locality on that day? Let it be 5-10 A.M.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) What is the Indian Standard Time at
noon in that locality on that day? Let it be 11-59 A.M.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Therefore, the difference between
sun-rise and noon will be 6 hrs. 49 min.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Divide this by 7. Then you get 1 hour 7
min. for each division.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) The day selected is a Wednesday. Hence
from sunrise 5-10 a.m. to 6.17 a.m. Mercury rules the time. The next is
governed by Moon. Hence 6-17 a.m. to 7-24 a.m. is ruled by Moon. The next
belongs to Saturn; i.e. Saturn is the lord for the duration from 7-24 a.m. to
8-31 A.M.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore this period is governed by Saturn
on a Wednesday ruled by Mercury. Therefore this conjoined period of Saturn and
Mercury are to be avoided for such actions as mentioned above. When this
conjoined period operates in the night and one spends his pleasant time with
his wife, he can avoid birth of children. This is an effective method of 'Birth
Control' as both Saturn and Mercury are effeminate planets. But people,
planting fruit bearing trees in such conjoined planetary hours, will have very
poor yield; the loss will be not only due to locust, pest, rats, etc., but also
due to the scarcity of water-supply and fertiliser. Hence for every action, one
is to note which planet will contribute for peace, prosperity, success, etc.,
and which planets are detrimental. Accordingly one can make a selection and
enjoy the fruits.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(Now the question arises, whether one can
come out successful by selecting such periods, even though he runs a very bad
period according to dasa or according to progression. People, running bad time
(a) will never follow this, or (b) even if he tries to follow he will do in the
evil sub-division of the planetary hour) What is the sub division?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The planetary hour is sub-divided among the
7 planets (just as, a dasa is divided among 9 planets as Bhuktis and each
Bhukti is again subdivided among the same 9 planets called antharams).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The first subdivision belongs to the planet
which rules the hour and then the subdivision are governed by the other planets
in the same order. Suppose the hora hour is ruled by Venus, then the first
subdivisions belong to Venus and the other 6 subdivisions will be governed by
Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What is the use of this sub-division?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Just as on a Wednesday, the hora of
Saturn is to be avoided for some actions and transactions, so also, in the few
minutes of the conjoined periods of Saturn sub-division in the Mercury hora and
Mercury sub-division in Saturn's hora are to be avoided.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) If a person enjoys Jupiter Dasa, Moon
Bukti, he can undertake to do any important work during the Hora of Jupiter and
sub of Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) If Mars Dasa, Jupiter Bhukti operate to
one, and if the judge announces the judgment favourable to one, then the time
at which he passes it, will be during Mars hora. Jupiter sub or Jupiter hora
Mars sub or Mars day (Tuesday) and Jupiter Hora or Jupiter day (Thursday) and
Mars Hora. In the latter case the sub will be ruled by either of the two or any
other significator contributing to his success.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) If one wants to construct a building,
he prefers the conjoined Hora of Mercury and Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) One desiring to get married, will
select the conjoined Planetary Hour of Venus and Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The above is general. Further while
selecting a Hora, the most important factor is omitted. Which is a serious
mistake, i.e., (a) one does not take into consideration which part of the
Zodiac rises in the East and what the Lagna is (b) nor does one consider the
position of planet at the time and their relative position to the ascendant, to
the cusp or that house which signifies the particular matter and to the Karaka
planet which also rules the same matter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Indeed, these three are the important
investigations to be made while electing a Muhurtha.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But for common undertakings and the usual
daily business, Hora will be helpful to offer confidence, peace of mind and
mostly success.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.58_HORA AND ITS USE_1"><span lang="EN-US">Sun Hora</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun is the lord of Sunday. The Hora of Sun
