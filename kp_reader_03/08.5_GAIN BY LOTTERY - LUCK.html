<body><h2 id="heading_08.5_GAIN BY LOTTERY - LUCK_0"><span lang="EN-US">GAIN BY LOTTERY - LUCK</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sir,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When I wrote a letter to you last month
asking you to explain how one could be honoured at a time when one had
sadesathi (seven and-half). I had, in fact, my horoscope in my mind, as, in
Bombay all are frightening me by saying that I am having 7 1/2 years Saturn.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.5_GAIN BY LOTTERY - LUCK_1"><span lang="EN-US">The chart is as under</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="539" src="img/image019.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You may remember that when you visited
Bombay in Aprii, 1960, you predicted that I should have gains without pains on
various occasions in my life and one of the dates was in December, 1964 inspite
of the so-called sade-Sati. It is really a pleasant surprise that I have got
Rs.500/- as a prize for the prize bond of Rs.5/- denomination purchased by me
on 16-4-1960 (on your advice) and the draw was held in Bombay on 1-12-64. The
number of my prize bond is A.H. 268076. This is for your information.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Answer:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Very happy to know that you had come by
fortune and thereby the prediction also has proved to be true.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sade-Sati is an excuse for the astrologer
with half-baked knowledge, to explain the never ending difficulties and worries
of native! It is a meaningless 'Slogan'</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You are now running Rahu Dasa, Moon Bhukti,
Sun Anthra. Actually you received, the cash on Monday ruled by Moon, in Swathi
Star, ruled by Rahu. Why?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Houses 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 and 11, receiving
favourable aspects promise victory over enemies; success in litigation; win in
competition and gain in lottery, games, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5th house shows the mind to speculate; the
tendency, the opportunity to bet, etc. Houses 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 12 receiving
good aspects are adverse, promise gain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The fifth house is Cancer. It is owned by
Moon. It was in Sravanam star, governed by Moon itself. So Moon gives you the
mind to speculate. Moon was in Capricorn, in the eleventh sign and the 11th
Bhava. Therefore, gain without much effort is assured during its sub-period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun owns Leo, the 6th house. It is in its
own constellation. What is the 6th house? Many, by mistake, think that it
indicates only debts and diseases. They miss to note that it causes luck also.
7th house shows those who make similar attempts in speculation-your
competitors. Is not the 6th house, twelve to 7? Does it not indicate loss to
them? Therefore, loss to competitors means gain to you. During Sun Bhukti, you
had promotion. Further, Sun in 11, in Capricorn, will ever offer you success.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu, the beneficial node, representing
Jupiter was in Pisces; in your ascendant. It was in Revathi star in the
constellation of Mercury who occupies the 10th house and receives the aspect
from Jupiter. Mercury, as lord of 4, if it would have been in 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 or
12 to your lagna, will cause loss to you and show disappointment. But planets
in 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 and 11 indicate gains to you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon and Sun are in 11. Therefore, you had
this, as predicted, during Rahu Dasa, Moon Bhukti, Sun Anthra on a day governed
by Moon and at the time when Moon transited in Rahu's star, Swathi.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">While Saturn was transiting in the other
constellation of Rahu-Sathabhisha, you received the prize. Saturn is lord of 11
and 12. It shows that you will gain and at once make purchases or spend away.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whenever one tries to find results by
transit, it is necessary to note primarily the transit of the Dasanatha,
Bhuktinadha, etc. and then, of all other planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You are running Rahu Dasa. Rahu is
transiting (according to Krishnamurti system) in Taurus, in Mrigasirish star
governed by Mars and in Saturn sub ruled by Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars owns the second house and Saturn the
11th. So you gain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars owns the 9th house; Saturn rules the
12th; so you make a long journey to a holy place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars owns the 2nd house and Saturn owns the
12th. Hence, you make purchases.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars owns the 9th house and Saturn the 11th
house. So you, renew the friendship and you enjoy your life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During the next year, such changes will not
repeat.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But after Rahu Dasa ends on 17 - 1 - 1966,
during Jupiter Dasa, Saturn Bhukti, as I already predicted, after March 1968
you will have fortune to a greater extent. As Mercury's sign Gemini is occupied
by Jupiter, and Gemini is the third sign of the Zodiac, try lottery. Never go
to races.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.4_RETIREMENT – WHEN?.html">← RETIREMENT–WHEN?</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.5_GAIN BY LOTTERY - LUCK">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.6_LUCK BY RACES.html">LUCK BY RACES →</a></div></body>
