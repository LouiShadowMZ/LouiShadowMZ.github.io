saying </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Sir, I have been placed under suspension from
my service for more than two years. Please, tell me whether I shall be
reinstated in my service or not; if so, when?</span>”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Give me a number within 249 please.</span>”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Take it as 145</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="543" src="img/image059.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The time, at the time of judgment was noted
as 10-31 PM. on 23-7-'70. The lagna falls in Libra 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US">26</span>′<span lang="EN-US">40</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> with the number 145. And, the other
cusps calculated as per rule of K.P.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Balance of Saturn Dasa 3 yrs. 14 days as on
23-7-'70.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.33_REINSTATEMENT IN SERVICE_1"><span lang="EN-US">PLANETARY CONDITIONS</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="446" src="img/image060.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_08.33_REINSTATEMENT IN SERVICE_2"><span lang="EN-US">ANALYSIS OF THE HORARY CHART</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The moon indicates the mind of the
consultant. Here Moon is posited in 5. The houses 5, 9, 1 indicate suspension.
Thus the Moon has the relation with suspension of the consultant. Again, Moon
is in the constellation of Saturn. The Saturn is posited in 6 and is aspected
by the Jupiter posited in 11. The sub of Moon is Rahu which is aspected by the
Venus and Jupiter. They are posited in 10 and 11 respectively. The houses 6,
10, 11 and 2 indicate promotion or reinstatement as per K.P. Hence the query is
justified which related with the Question of reinstatement in the service as
well.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub lord of the cusp of 11 is connected
with any one of the houses 2, 6, 10 and 11 in any manner, the consultant will
have the positive answer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here Mercury is the sub lord of the 11th
cusp. Mercury is conjoined with Sun and Mars, the lord of 10 and 6
respectively. Mercury is the sign lord of 11. The sub of Mercury is Rahu</span>—<span lang="EN-US">represents Saturn as well as Venus and Jupiter by aspect and
occupation. Saturn, Jupiter and Venus are posited in 6, 11 and 10 respectively.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, the consultant must have a positive
answer and he must be successful in his attempt. Ultimately, he will be
reinstated in his former position without any monetary loss.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As such, it is declared that he would win
the case of suspension ultimately and would be reinstated in his service in the
former position with all his arrear payments.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.33_REINSTATEMENT IN SERVICE_3"><span lang="EN-US">REINSTATEMENT - WHEN</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Judge the significators of the house 2, 6,
10 and 11 for promotion or reinstatement in service.</span>”<span lang="EN-US">
The reinstatement is a kind of promotion as it enhances the status of a person
from the position of suspension; income also increases.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2nd House is vacant; lord is Mars. Jupiter
is in Mars star, 6th house is occupied by Saturn. Sun, Moon and Mars are
posited in Saturn star. Lord of 6 is Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10th house is occupied by Ketu and Venus.
Ketu and Venus are posited in their respective stars. Lord of 10 is Sun. Saturn
is in Sun</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house is occupied by Jupiter. No one
is in Jupiter star. Lord of 11 is Mercury. Mercury is its own star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, all the planets have come under the
list of Significators, except Rahu. But Rahu by aspect will also become a
significator. Jupiter and Venus both aspect Rahu. Rahu is in the sign of
Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When this position arises, our Gurujee has
suggested to us to eliminate those which are not the ruling planets at the time
of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets at the time of judgment
are as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rising lagna: Pisces, Lord Jupiter</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">R/Lagna star: U.P. Pada, Lord Saturn</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign:
Pisces, Lord Jupiter</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star: U.P.
Pada, Lord Saturn</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Day: Thursday, Lord Jupiter</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, take Jupiter and Saturn. As Rahu
occupies Saturn sign and is aspected by Jupiter take Rahu as the strong
significator with the above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, during the conjoined period of
the above, the consultant will be reinstated without fail and the transit will
agree.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At present, the consultant is running
Saturn dasa Rahu bhukti Sun anthra and it is upto 30-8-1970 (around). Sun is
the constellation lord of 10</span>—<span lang="EN-US">signifies the 6 house
matter. During this period, Saturn shookshma will start from 3-8-1970 will be
upto 11-8-1970.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon will transit Scorpio on 11-8-70
through Saturn star. Mars is the sign lord of 2 and 6, and signifies the 6th
house matter. Its sub signifies the 10th house matter. Saturn is the dasa lord
and is posited in the 6th house. On 10th August, Moon will transit in Venus
sign Libra, (Venus is the sign lord of 1, 8 and 12) and in the star of Jupiter
(posited in 11th house). Besides this, all other planets on 11-8-70 are in the
sign or star of the significators of 2, 6, 10 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, it is declared to him after the
selection of the date: </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Sir, don't worry! You will be
reinstated on 11-8-70", and you will rejoin duty on 11-8-70".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Sure, Sir</span>”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Certainly</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Thanks</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Days passed on. On 10-8-70, in the evening,
that very gentleman came and said, </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Your prediction is
very correct. I have received the reinstatement orders today. I have been asked
to rejoin on 11-8-70</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.32_WHEN WILL I GET MY FIRST SALARY.html">← WHEN WILL I GET MY FIRST SALARY</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.33_REINSTATEMENT IN SERVICE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.34_PHOTOGRAPHY.html">PHOTOGRAPHY →</a></div></body>
