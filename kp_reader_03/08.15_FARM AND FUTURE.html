produce.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence one takes up farming, if one enjoys
the conjoined period of Venus, Mars, Moon and Jupiter.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.15_FARM AND FUTURE_1"><span lang="EN-US">An Example horoscope</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="560" src="img/image037.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu Dasa 6 years, 2 months and 13 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second house extends from 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US">34</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Aquarius and 4</span>°<span lang="EN-US">34</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Aries.

Mercury. In its star Sani, Sun and Kethu are deposited.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10th house is occupied by Mars, Saturn, Sun
and Kethu. Majority of the planets are connected with farming. Rahu represents
Venus who is in Mars star. Rahu is also in Mars star. Mars is in Saturn star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu represents Mars and Moon is in Ketu
star. Hence all planets are connected with farming.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Of these, which are favourable? Those
planets which are deposited in such a sub which is ruled by Mars or Venus or
Moon or Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun, Moon and Venus are in Moon's sub.
Jupiter is in Mar's sub. Rahu and Ketu are in Jupiter sub. Mars, which is in
Saturn star and Saturn sub denotes that during Mars sub period, one will
purchase plot, acquire and use it for one's business as Saturn is lord of 2,
deposited in 10 in the constellation of lord of 6. Therefore, this gentleman
has purchased the plot of land for farming on 6th July, 1968. At that time, he
was running Moon Dasa, Venus Bhukti, Mars Anthra, and Saturn Sookshma. Mars and
Saturn, as already said, are the two planets, which are connected with 2, 4 and
11, indicate purchase of property. Second house shows acquisition, 4th house
indicates land and the 11th house shows possession and gains. Since Mars and
Saturn are connected with 2, 4 and 11, he purchased in that conjoined period.
The day was Saturday and Moon was transiting in Venus sign, Jupiter star, and
Venus the Bhuktinatha was transiting in Jupiter star Punarvasu. Thus according
to the method advocated by Krishnamurti Padhdhati, it is found that these
agree. Thereby it is a confirmation that the horoscope erected according to the
timing given by parents is correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards the future of any profession,
one is to know whether the periods (according to Vimshottari Dasa) ruled by the
planets have any connection whatsoever with that nature of profession, which
has been started. If the following dasa lord has no connection, then that
particular nature of profession will come to an end and according to the nature
of the dasa lord, there will be a change in the profession. Now the Mars Dasa
follows with that of Moon and Mars is in Saturn star, Saturn sub. Therefore, more
and more acquisition of land, expansion of business, etc. are shown. Then
follows Rahu Dasa, who is deposited in Mars star and Jupiter sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Students should note that any planet, which
is deposited in Saturn sub, no doubt, gives advantageous results, if he is a
benefic; but yet one will not be satisfied with the net profit; But if Jupiter
happens to be the sub lord, there will be the providential help so that the
yield from the field will be satisfactory and also the price will be such as to
bring larger profits. Therefore, I predict that during the remaining period of
Moon Dasa, in which the cultivation will be going on and the farm will come up
without any difficulty for watering, etc., as the Sun Bhukti alone is left out,
which is also in Venus sub. During Mars Dasa as Mars is in the sub of Saturn,
the growth will not be as satisfactory as it was, in Moon Dasa, yet since it is
lord of 10 and 11 and also in the constellation of the planet in the 10th
bhava, there will be progress; Saturn in Scorpio sign (watery, fruitful sign)
in Anuradha star (Anuradha indicates fertiliser, chemical, etc.) show that he
will make use of chemical fertiliser to have greater yield from the field, but
not to the extent to which one expects. The best sub periods in Mars Dasa would
be Jupiter Bhukti, Mercury Bhukti and Bukties of the luminaries Sun and Moon.
During Rahu Dasa, as it is in Mars constellation and in the sub of Jupiter
there will be bumper crop and most satisfactory results promising increases in
income, satisfactory bank position, expansion of business etc.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.14_EDUCATION.html">← EDUCATION</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.15_FARM AND FUTURE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.16_SHALL I OWN A CINEMA THEATRE_ IF SO_WHEN.html">SHALL I OWN A CINEMA THEATRE_ IF SO_WHEN →</a></div></body>
