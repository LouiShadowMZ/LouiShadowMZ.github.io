constellations, as shown below.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Aries: Aswini, Bharani and 1/4 of

occupied by a planet should be judged, taking in which constellation the planet
is posited. The role of the sign occupied by the planet is not so important, as
that of the constellation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a planet is in 12th bhava, it is said
that it should cause separation, loss, issue of cheque. etc. But actually there
is reunion, gain, receipt of cheques. Example is given below;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="562" src="img/image007.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter Dasa 3 years 1 month 6 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This Gentleman had gains, fortune and
success during Saturn, Mars and Sun Sub periods; desirable benefits during
Jupiter and Mercury sub periods. But Ketnu in 10, Venus in 11 and Rahu in 4
gave untoward and undesirable results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to traditional system. Saturn and
Sun must be the worst. Jupiter also will fall in 12th bhava and ought to have
been very bad. Venus and Budha causing Dharma Karmadhipathi Rajayoga, should
give brilliant results. Rahu representing, Venus must cause Rajoyoga. Mars
should be dangerous. This person was my friend for a long number of years and
such results alone opened my eyes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In 1939, when 1 visited Coimbatore, I heard
one Nadi reader, reading the results of a few persons in his cottage. I
understood that planets</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> results were read as they were
found in the bhavas. Then I heard many Nadi readers. None made use of the
constellation. While reading the Nadi, I understood that without assigning the
reason, the results were read and they were astoundingly meticulously correct.
For the future, they gave the reasons taking the traditional methods of the
bhavas and the future proved to be mostly a failure. So I started the research,
collecting the horoscopes of old people with past events.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Such horoscopes as shown above threw the
light. What is it? A planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US">
offers the results of the house occupied by that planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">B</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> which is the lord of the star wherein
this planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> is deposited.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again trouble arose when 2, 3 or 4 planets
are found in the same constellation, as all the planets in the same star,
though referring the same matters, yet gave diametrically opposite results,
i.e. if planets A, B, C and D are in one constellation, in the same house, A
and C gave pleasant results whereas B and D gave just opposite results. This
made me think further. 1 found that a particular dasa is to cause Rajayaga. But
yet, he gets most desirable result, in some bhukties and disadvantageous
results in some Bhukties. Then 1 started doing research and in all cases 1
found that planets, though they are in the same constellation, yet a few are
beneficial and a few unfavourable. This caused me to further carry on the
research. 1 found that every constellation must be divided in the manner 1 have
said into 9 subs and each sub having that area in a constellation in the
proportion in which they are allotted the number of years in Vimshodhari dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I proved that planets occupying any one
constellation, has connection with the Bhava occupied by the lord of the
constellation. These planets in that constellation are termed as the </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Significators</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> of the bhava occupied by the
lord of the constellation. Thus if one works out for all the planets then each
planet is found to signify the matters of a few houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then judge each planet. The planet
signifies a matter. Whether it votes for the progress and prosperity of that
matter or due to the sub lord it is not capable of doing good, further it does
harm to that bhava signified by the planet, is to be studied.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This discovery has crowned me with success.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I say </span>“<span lang="EN-US">if a planet
is the significator of lagna bhava, it gives long life, success in attempts; it
helps to maintain good health, if the sub lord is not the significator of 6 or
8 or 12. If the sub lord of the planet signifies 6th house and if a planet
shows lagna results and occupy such a sub ruled by the significator of 6, he
falls ill. The constellation refers to his health, sub signifying 6 gives
disease. If a planet signifies lagna bhava and it is in the sub of the
significator of 8, he meets with danger.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord signifies 12th house and
the significator of lagna is in such a sub, one runs away, or one is
imprisoned, or hospitalized.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore constellation lord shows whom or
which matter it refers. But the deciding factor, good or bad, success or
failure is shown by the sub occupied by the significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a planet A is the significator of
second bhava and it is in the sub of 6 one borrows but if it is in the sub of 8
or 12, he lends to others or repays loan.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is in the sub of 11, there is gain;
of what? Either money or son - in - law or daughter - in - law or child birth
to the person. If the significator of the second house is in the sub of the
significator of 3, through brother one gains, brother loses or gives away: If
it is in the sub of 4, one may have car or house during the period of the
significator in 2, in the sub of 4th house significator, in their conjoined
periods. if the significator of the 4th house which rules the sub and if it is
also the significator of 11, he purchases or acquires, if the sub lord who is
also the significator of 12 other than 4, he sells and converts the permanent
possession as liquid cash and his bank position improves by losing the car or
building. If the sub lord of the planet signifying second house is the
significator of 10 and 12, then lets his land for tenancy or lets the house for
rent. Why? 10th house is the 4th to the 7th with whom you transact, so that
which he takes is given by you (12) and he is indebted (6).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a planet is the significator of 7th
house and if it is in the sub of 2 or 11 one gains, there is reunion, one gets
married, etc. If it is in the sub of the significator of 12, separation or ill
health to wife. If it in the sub of 1 and 2, danger to partners</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s life. There can be 3 or 4 or any number of significators for the
7th. Therefore during the period or sub period of a planet in such a sub whose
lord signifies 12th house, wife fails ill - or the native goes away and
separation is caused. If the sub lord signifies 6th house, the wife goes away,
thereby there is separation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the planet is the significator of 7th
house and sub of 4, partner gains, makes money and earns name. If the
significator of 7 is in the sub of 5, partner makes money, friendship and
enjoys pleasure. if the sub is ruled by the significator of 8th house, there is
either income or danger to life. If that significator of 8th house is also
significator of 5 partner gains. But significator of 8 is also significator of
1 and 7, it means death as 8 and 1 are maraka house to the 7th.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus one should note separately what each
planet signifies. Then in which sub each planet is posited.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Finally one should take each house and
judge, to which bhavas the planet are the significators and the sub lords.
Judge calmly how each bhava is receiving good results from a few and adverse
from the rest.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Say, mother, father, child, etc. Mother is
shown by 4th house. Father by 9th house. child by 5th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="544" src="img/image008.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, note the significators of 4: so also
the significators of 9 and 5.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take the above chart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu Dasa balance 0 - 5 - 23,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The constellation ruled by a planet
indicates the matters, signified by the bhava occupied or owned by it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub lord occupied by a planet denotes
whether it is auspicious for the progress of that Bhava or inauspicious so that
one has obstacle or faces disappointment or negation of the matter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This applies to all bhava results. If lagna
is occupied by a planet or owned by one and if a planet either the same
lagnadhipathi or any other planet is deposited in the occupants or owner</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star, then they indicate first house matters. If the depositor in
that constellation is in the favourable sub matters indicated by lagna will
thrive. If the depositor in that constellation is in unfavourable sub the
matters indicated by the lord of the constellation as per its occupation or
ownership will suffer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of lagna is Sun: no planet is in
lagna, Sun</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s stars are Karthik, Uthraphalguni and
Uthrashada. Planets, if deposited in these stars will refer the matters
signified by first house. If there is no planet, Sun gives lagna bhava results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the above chart, there is no planet in
Sun</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star. Hence Sun gives lagna results. Sun is in
Moon</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star. Moon is in 9 and owns 12. Hence Sun mostly
refers to the matters signified by 9 and 12 i.e. long journey: staying outside:
loss of father. permanent possession of father, separation from father. Let us
judge the death of his father.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note the sub occupied by Sun. It is in
Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sub, what can Jupiter do to the 9th house?
What can Jupiter do to the 12th house?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter is in Saturn</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star. As Saturn is the Bhadhakastha - naadhipathi to 9, Jupiter
indicates Bhadhaka to father. Therefore if a constellation indicates father,
then the sub of Jupiter in that constellation indicates danger to father.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore Sun in the constellation of Moon
in 9 and sub of Jupiter - the Bhadhaka to father, promises danger to father.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9 house is owned by Mars. It governs
Mrigasira, Chithra and Dhanishta stars. Rahu and Mercury are in Mars star. Rahu
is. in the sub of Mars who denotes, longevity to father. Mercury is in the sub
of Saturn Bhadhaka to father. Hence Rahu is a benefic whereas Mercury is evil.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To the longevity of father houses 2 and 7
counted from 9th is evil. Both are owned by Venus. Rahu occupies 2 (to9). Mars
occupies Venus star; none in Rahu star. Mars is in the sub of Venus. So it is
harmful : Rahu is in the sub of Mars; it is good.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore Sun, Mercury, Mars are evil.
Venus is in Jupiter sub. Venus is also evil. (Venus is in the constellation of Kethu
who represents 4th and 9th houses. Therefore Venus indicates the houses 9, 10
and 3 -danger to father.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">His father died during Sun Dasa Mercury
Bhukthi Venus Anthra in July 1952.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us judge 4th house. It is occupied by
Sani and Kethu. It is owned by Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">SO planets in Saturn's stars Kethu stars
and Mars stars are those which refer 4th house matters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus In Kethu star, Jupiter in Saturn
star, Mercury in Mars star indicate 4th house matters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is in the sub of Jupiter,
Marakasthanadhipathi and Venus is in Marakasthana to 4 (2nd from 4th).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter is in Venus sub. It is evil.
Mercury is in Saturn sub. As Saturn is in rapt conjunction with Kethu and
Saturn is in the constellation of (Mercury, lord of 8th from 4th) Mercury is
evil : Saturn is also evil.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now Venus, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, Moon,
etc. refer 4th house matters. It is. the lord of the sub which indicates
whether 4th house matter will thrive or not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is in 2 in the sub of lord of 2.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury in the constellation of planet in 2
to 4, owner of 4 and in sub of evil in 4.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn in the sub of Jupiter and Kethu in
the sub of Jupiter, both occupying 4th house are evil. Hence he lost his mother
during Venus Dasa Mercury Bhukthi Saturn Anthra on 27 - 4 - 47.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us analyse the date of death of his
mother. It was on 11 - 4 - 47 when Venus Dasa (in the constellation of occupant
of 4 and sub of the occupant of 10) Mercury Bhukthi (constellation of planet in
2 to 4 and sub of planet in 4) and anthra of Saturn which refers the 4th house
(to give life or cause death depending on the sub which Saturn occupied) and it
is in the sub of Mars and Shookshma of Rahu in 10 which is also in the
constellation of Mars in 2 to 4 and sub of Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Day of demise - Friday. Star Moolam where
Dasanatha was (Jupiter rasi Jupiter significator of 4 in Saturn star and sub of
Venus in 2 to 4) at night when lagna was in Poornashada 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in Dhanus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Death of child happened during Moon Dasa
Jupiter Bhukthi Rahu Anthra. Moon is in the constellation of Kethu and sub of
Mercury. Kethu has to give the results of planet with which it is conjoined, as
it is a node. Saturn is lord of 2 to 5 and situated in 12 to 5. Hence Moon is
definitely evil as it is in the constellation of the node representing the
second house to the 5th and in the sub of lord of 7 to 5, situated in 2 to 5.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter is in the constellation of Saturn,
lord of 2 in 12 to 5th house and sub of Venus, which is the occupant of 5 in
the constellation of node in 12 to 5. Venus itself is evil to 5. Mars in Venus
star Venus sub is also evil. Rahu in Venus sign Mars star and Mars sub is
definitely evil.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, Moon Dasa Jupiter Bhukthi Rahu
Anthra was evil.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take pleasant functions. Marriage</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Judge houses 2, 7, and 11 counted from
lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2, 7 and 11 are vacant. 2 is ruled by Sun,
11 is ruled by Mercury. 7 is owned by Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn and Kethu are in Mercury star.
Jupiter is in Saturn's star. Kethu is stronger than lord of 7. Moon and Venus
are in Kethu star. Sun is also strong as there is no planet in Sun's star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Marriage took place during Venus Dasa, Kethu
Bhukthi, Venus Anthra, Moon Shookshma on 6 - 7 - 1947 on Sravanam star day.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is in Kethu star. Kethu is stronger
than Saturn, lord of 7 (7th house vacant).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu is in the star of Mercury (lord of 2
and 11). Both houses, vacant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is in Kethu star. Kethu stronger than
Saturn, lord of 7.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu has to predominantly indicate
Saturn's result; then only that of Mars. Moon's star is not in Mars sign.
Hence, Sravanam star governed by Moon in Saturn's sign gave marriage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Normally when one finds Saturn and Kethu in
4 and 9th house occupied by lord of 12, one following traditional Astrology
must say that the native will have no tendency towards education. Also that he
cannot come up nicely in studies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati,
Saturn and Kethu in 4 are in the constellation of Mercury, lord of 11 and sub
of Mars owner of 4, education and 9, higher education.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to my method, if the dasanatha is
connected with houses 4 and 9, they will give education.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus in the constellation of node in 4
gave studies throughout Venus Dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun in the constellation of Moon in 9 gave
higher studies. As Moon is also significator of 12, Sun in the constellation of
Moon, gave the break and ended his studies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He discontinued his studies after
