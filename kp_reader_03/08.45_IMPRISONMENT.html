<body><h2 id="heading_08.45_IMPRISONMENT_0"><span lang="EN-US">IMPRISONMENT</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hindu sages give various condition under
which one will be imprisoned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ganesa, son of the artist Gopal and
grandson of Kanhajee, the Court astrologer in Gujarat, in Jataka Alankara says
that a person will be imprisoned if all the malefics are posited in 2, 5, 9 and
12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the Lagna is Aries or Taurus or
Sagittarius he will suffer rigorous imprisonment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mahadeva in Jataka Tatwa gives the same
rulings. He adds that persons born in Scorpio having malefics in 2 &amp; 12 and
5 &amp; 9 will be kept in cellars. If malefics are in 2 and 12, also 5 and 9 to
Aries, Gemini, Virgo and Libra-borns they will be put in fetters. Cancer,
Capricorn and Pisces-born will be kept in a fort without fetters if the Lagna
is hemmed between malefics, occupying 2 and 12, and also forming trine aspect
to Lagna from 5 and 9 i.e. they will be not tied over the legs or chained.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lords of 1 and 6 are conjoined with
Saturn in a Kendra (1, 4, 7 or 10) or in a Kona (1 or 5 or 9) one will be
imprisoned. In Brihat Jataka Varahamihira says that a man will be lathi charged
and imprisoned if Saturn is in Scorpio.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Vaidyanadha Dikshitha in Jataka Parijata
mentions that one will suffer imprisonment during the period of the Chakradasa
of the 6th rasi.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kalidas in Uthra Kalamitra says that one is
to judge imprisonment from 12th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ramadayalu in the Sanketanidhi says that a
person will commit murder and undergo imprisonment if Venus is in 2, Moon in 1,
Sun and Mercury in 12 and Rahu in 5. He also suggests that one should judge the
houses 6 and 12 for imprisonment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus these authors are of opinion that 12th
house signifies imprisonment; 5, 6, 8 and 9th houses are also to be judged.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The scientific explanations for
imprisonments and how to judge according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati are given
below: -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Will I ever go to Jail? If so, what is the
duration? When I will be released? Will I be imprisoned off and on? Why?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Imprisonment includes separation from the
family not to have free moment: to be confined within 4 walls; change of
residence and bedding: no Suka Sayana.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2nd house shows life with the members of
family.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Restrictions in the movement are indicated
by the 12th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Change of residence: 3 and 12. Bedding:
Desirable or undesirable, 12th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suka Sayana-12th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore malefics occupying the
constellation of the planets situated in the houses 2 and 12, occupants of
these two houses owning evil houses, evil planets in the constellation of the
lords of these houses, and lords of these bhavas threaten imprisonment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lord of 1 is also connected with any of
these, one courts imprisonment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lord of 6 is connected, due to inability
to return the loan, civil suit &amp; imprisonment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter, Venus or lord of 9 and 1 connected
with the significator, indicates imprisonment on political grounds.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars lord of 8 connected with any of these
significator show that one will be punished for theft.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn and Mercury threaten imprisonment
due to forgery, falsification of accounts and misappropriation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars, Saturn and Venus threaten
imprisonment due to rape, kidnapping and brothel.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars and Saturn give imprisonment due to
murder.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Release includes reunion with kith and kin,
free movement and independence: 2</span><span lang="EN-US">nd</span><span lang="EN-US"> and 11</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house
indicate the above results. Therefore benefics in the constellation of the
significators of the houses 2 and 11 indicate the release.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the period or subperiod governed by
evils connected with the houses 2 and 12 show the time of imprisonment and the
period and subperiod of the benefics connected with the houses 2 and 11
indicate the time of release. The interval is the duration of the imprisonment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the evil planet connected with the
houses 2 and 12 were to be in 3 or 6 or 9 or 12 and in a fixed sign, the
duration is long.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the evil planet be lord of 1 (like
Saturn for Aquarius Lagna) and owning another evil house 6 or 12 and is in 4 or
7, or 8 or 12, connected with the significators for imprisonment, is combust or
retrograde, one will be a jail bird.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lord of 8 is strong and afflicted one
will die in the jail.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu, the ascending node is the chief
significator for jails.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Good aspects to 12</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> cusp or
to the significator of the 12</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house and evil aspect to the second cusp or the significators of
the second house forebode confinement.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the course of my official tours to
inspect the water supply to the prisoners in the jails in Madras State, I had
the occasion to collect materials, horoscopes, etc., from both the supervisory
staff and convicts. In majority of the cases, there was strong indication of
imprisonment because of the occupation of an evil planet in 2 or 12 and in the
constellation or sub of Rahu which is also connected with 2 or 12. Again I
checked my horoscope and found how mysteriously the periods agree whenever I
visit jails without committing any crime and without being so punished. So,
whether on duty or due to punishment, only when the periods agree, then alone
one can visit a jail.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.44_GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS.html">← GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.45_IMPRISONMENT">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.46_SPIRITUAL LIFE.html">SPIRITUAL LIFE →</a></div></body>
