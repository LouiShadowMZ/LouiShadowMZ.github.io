<body><h2 id="heading_08.31_MUSIC_0"><span lang="EN-US">MUSIC</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Music is an art. It has its own beauty. It
directly appeals to one of the five senses, i.e. the sense of hearing. A
musician changes the Rhythm and observes that the audience is much pleased.
Also, the musician finds that the variations of the pitch is enjoyed by one who
listens to it and who can follow it. Blending of notes in harmony is an art.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In instrumental music, Rhythm is very
essential, especially in stringed ones. But in wind instruments Nadaswaram,
Flute etc. pitch adds beauty. It offers the power of melody. One can develop
harmony very nicely in stringed instruments.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, 5th
house indicates whether one can learn music, one can appreciate music, one can
become a musician or one hates music or one is reluctant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. If the sublord of the 5th cusp is
deposited in the constellation of a planet situated in Leo or Aquarius, one
will be a popular musician. Venus will also contribute for one's grand success
in the field of music.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. If the lord of the constellation in
which the sublord of 5 is deposited is connected with Moon and Venus, one will
have the taste for improving his talent in music. If it is connected with Venus
and Mercury, one will be supremely intelligent even to compose songs for
musicians. If it is also connected with Mars (i.e. if these planets are the
significators of 5th house.) one will be bold and never he or she will have
stage fear. Much of Harmony is indicated by Neptune. In Krishnamurti Padhdhati
we do not include Neptune. Yet if a planet, the significator of the 5th house,
is conjoined with Neptune, then he or she will render it with great harmony and
will be able to present fine notes. For Thalam, Rhythm, Mercury should be
predominant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. If the lord of the constellation in
which the sublord of the 5th is posited, occupies either Gemini or Sagittarius,
one can render the music to appeal to the senses of the audience.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. If it were to occupy Cancer or
Capricorn, one can simply enjoy music by hearing and Saturn will be
predominant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. For changes in the Rhythm, the lord of
the constellation in which the sublord of the 5th is situated, should be in
Aries or Libra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. The pitch can be changed at appropriate
time if the lord of the constellation in which the sublord of the 5th cusp is
deposited is in Aries or Libra</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. Notes can be blended and harmony can be
produced if that lord is tenanted in Virgo or Pisces.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Music had its origin even in Vedic age.
Sama Veda is rendered in such a melodious tune that it is said that Lord Siva,
the Destroyer, could be pleased with reciting Sama Veda. (Notorious Ravana
pleased Lord Siva only by reciting Sama Veda). It has got its own peculiar
Rhythm, tune and melody.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Goddess Saraswathi is known as the only
Goddess having the most melodious Veena held in her hands. Lord Krishna is
known for His melodious tune in Flute which enthralled not only the Gopis but
also all the creations of God.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even in Western countries there is a story
that Muses instructed how to play the lyre which was obtained from Apollo and
when he played, even the trees and the rocks on Olympus along with the wild
beasts, enjoyed the music from his golden harp. When Thracian ladies killed
him, Zeus kept the lyre in the heavens and the constellation is called </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">LYRA</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All these go to show that music was there
in some form or the other from the very great antiquity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In history, the first significant period
for music was that of David. His psalms were sung by groups of people
wonderfully. It was about 1000 B.C. Later only around 1100 A.D. modern music
had its origin in North. In the 585 B.C. Pythogoras found the inter-connection
between the Rhythm of the music and the disposition of the planets. He created
interest to study music and astronomy. Kepler developed his knowledge by
musical parallels which led to his important three laws. Herschel was first a
great musician, then only he become an astronomer. In Shakespeare's period only
six notes were prevalent. In </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">The Taming of the Shrew</span>’<span lang="EN-US">, Act III Scene I, he personifies the six notes. The astrologers
then omitted Saturn and attributed each note to one planet. They did not know
Uranus and Neptune then. Further, the references made by Shakespeare about
astrology in his own time were not correct. One commits a mistake if one relies
on it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Around 550 A.D. Boetius published a book on
music which was the text book in English universities. Later Sebastian Bach
developed the music in 1700 A.D. He was called the father of modern music.
Mozart began to render music in a very enchanting manner and he started
composing from his age of 9.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In India the greatest flutist Mr. T. R.
Mahalingam also proved himself to be a genius with great talent. None was born
before him and it is doubtful whether any one will be born after him. So also
Mrs. M. S. Subbalakshmi had hypnotised the whole world by her gifted melodius
tune and the scientific rendering of the music. It is only Mrs. M.S.
Subbalakshmi who had pocketed innumerable Honour from various nationalities,
and also given away most of the collections for improvement of Institutions.
Nowadays Famous Radha Jayalakshmi are forward in the field and people leave
even their urgent works to attend their concert.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The greatest devotee of Sri Rama, Sri
Thiagaraja was both a great musician and composer of songs of Lord Rama.
Venkata Subbiah of Uthukuli and Shri Deekshadar are the other two devotees who
have composed prayers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrologically how to find out whether one
will compose or one will perform the music? There were people who had little as
performer or any musical instrument or vocal but they had composed versions to
be played by others. Such people had Strong Saturn as the significator of the
5th house. It must be connected with Mercury and hence the songs were dignified
and scholarly. If Mars and Venus were also connected they can compose for
dramas. Saturn, Venus and Mars were responsible to compose love songs (only kama)
Jupiter helps one to compose prayers. Mercury assists to compose such ones
useful for dance. So, musical composition is one part of the art whereas to
execute it, is another. Most of the composers will be skilful artists who could
play, whereas all musicians cannot compose.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">[Astrologers can predict which variety of
the instrument or vocal is suited to one. Astrologer may not be a musician but
mostly be a talkative person as Mercury and Uranus will be predominant in his
chart for his profession. He will not allow the consultant to talk. But the
astrologer will talk and talk. A few astrologers alone can compose astrological
principles in poems and render it in melodious tune. But many traditional
astrologers commit to memory the slokas and render them.]</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.30_INDEPENDENT BUSINESS.html">← INDEPENDENT BUSINESS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.31_MUSIC">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.32_WHEN WILL I GET MY FIRST SALARY.html">WHEN WILL I GET MY FIRST SALARY →</a></div></body>
