moving in the Zodiac produce such results which they indicate as they pass from
one sign to the other and in the 12 signs. By Janma Rasi, it is meant that Moon
was in a particular sign for that person. They take the Lagna and only the
seven planets from Sun to Saturn which rule the seven days of the week.
Therefore they judge from the 8 positions. So the astrologer is to prepare
different maps called Sun Ashtaka Varga; Moon Ashtaka Varga; Mars Ashtaka Varga
and so on up to Saturn Ashtaka Varga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">While calculating, one need not consider
whether the planet is in the beginning or in the middle or in the end of the
sign. calculations are made from sign to sign. the houses are not taken (This
is defect number-1). Let me take for any one planet and explain. When one
prepares Sun Ashtaka Varga; one makes a map of the Zodiac with twelve signs in
it. Sun contributes beneficial results as are indicated by it when it passes in
the signs 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 counted from the sign it occupied in the birth
chart. Similarly Moon contributes for beneficial results in Sun Ashtaka Varga
when Sun passes through the signs 3, 6, 10 and 11 counted from the sign
occupied by Moon. Mars contributes for favourable results in Sun Ashtaka Varga
when Sun passes through the signs 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 counted from the
sign occupied by Mars in the birth chart; Similarly for Mercury, 3, 5, 6, 9,
10, 11 and 12 from the position of Mercury; for Jupiter, count from Jupiter's
sign, the signs 5, 6, 9 and 11; for Venus 6, 7 and 12; for Saturn 1, 2, 4, 7,
8, 9, 10 and 11; The seven planets are over. But Ashtaka Varga means eight
vargas. So the eighth varga belongs to Lagna. Lagna contributes in Sun Ashtaka
Varga, the signs counted from Lagna </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> 3, 4, 6, 10, 11
and 12. Mark it as </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">L</span>’<span lang="EN-US">
Satyacharya says </span>–</p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Janma kalae, Graha yatra Sthitha</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thath Sthana tho</span>’<span lang="EN-US">

Gunakara have advocated this method. Varahamihira and Vaidyanatha Dikshithar
have mentioned in the books Brihat Jataka and Jataka parijata.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Modern Astrological Research Institute,
Madras has found </span>–</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Ashtaka Varga is incomplete: hence
incorrect.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) It needs more research to make it
correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, full details are not furnished.
But why I declare that the literature available at present is insufficient to
get correct results is given below :-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Longevity or Ayus is calculated from
Ashtaka Varga. Let one calculate for three people born on the same day, in the
same hospital at an interval of 40 minutes, all the three having the same Lagna</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then the Lagna sign is the same. The
positions of planets also remain same. Hence by calculation, all the three will
get the same Ashtaka Varga figure. Ekadipatya reduction, Rasi Gunakara, remain
the same. Therefore if we calculate longevity, all the three persons should
have the same figure, same span of life. Of the twins born in the same sign as
lagna, one lives and one dies. Longevity is not the same. They do not die on
the same day after having lived for some years. When such is the case, days of
toil to erect so many Varga tables, reduction, calculation etc., will be found
to be useless. For transit results also it is not applicable to twins.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My first principle is that one can follow
any system which is applicable to twins or persons born in the same sign as
Lagna on the same day in the same locality.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards prosperity, it is said that
persons born in Mesha-Aries Lagna having Sun in Aries </span>–<span lang="EN-US">
Mesha in exaltation and Jupiter in 4 in Cancer-Karkata in exaltation will
become a King and will have 100,000 horses in his command. Jupiter remains for
1 year in Cancer, on an average. In that year, Sun will be in Aries for a
month. In that month on an average 1/12th of the births may be in Aries.
Therefore one in 1728 births will be having such a disposition. How the above
rule can be quoted? To whom and when? Probably, one living or dead centuries
ago, having had such a position, will be taken and this rule applied and
appreciated. I pose this. There are horoscopes of persons living and suffering
born in 1955, 1943, 1932, 1920, 1907 and so on, between 13th April and 13th May
at the time of sunrise in Aries Lagna. Just like this rule is not universally
applicable to all, Ashtaka Varga is.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Take the horoscopes of husband and wife
born on different dates. Calculate the number of the children. Harmony among
the couple will be affected as the figures never tally.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence Ashtaka Varga is not explained. Yet
to convince the readers, in my magazine Astrology and Athrishta, we shall deal
three different cases and convince the readers. If by God</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Grace any improvement to make it perfect, dawns in our mind, we
will publish.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.53_ANNUAL HOROSCOPE.html">← ANNUAL HOROSCOPE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.54_ASHTAKA VARGA">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.55_HORARY ASTROLOGY.html">HORARY ASTROLOGY →</a></div></body>
