<body><h2 id="heading_08.50_VIMSHOTHARI DASA – UDU DASA_0"><span lang="EN-US">VIMSHOTHARI DASA </span><span>–</span><span lang="EN-US"> UDU DASA</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Calculation etc. is given in Reader No.1.
Now in 3rd reader let us know the principle and the method to be followed </span>–</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following principle is to be strictly
and universally applied. Suppose planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">D</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> rules the dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) What is the nature of the planet? It
indicates how the result happens; How a matter is fulfilled. If the dasa lord
is Jupiter, and if the result is </span>“<span lang="EN-US">gains i.e. profit</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> one has lawfully by honest means that which one is entitled to it,
legitimately, by fair deal he gets. But suppose the dasa lord is Saturn, he
gains by foul means, the unaccountable money by receiving under the table or by
knocking away without other</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s knowledge or uttering
falsehood or committing forgery, etc. Thus how one enjoys a result is indicated
by the general nature of the planet who rules the period or sub period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Which houses are owned by dasa lord </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">D</span>’<span lang="EN-US">? Which are the matters signified by those
houses owned by dasa lord? (The dasa lord may own only one house or 2 or 3
depending upon the number of cusps falling in the signs owned by them). The
source of the results is indicated by the house or house, owned by it. One may
gain or lose, come out successful or meet with failure whatever it is, how this
happens, who brings about such results who are the cause or which is the cause
is clearly shown by the matters signified by the houses owned by Dasa Lord </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">D</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) In which constellation is </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">D</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> posited? Who rules this constellation?
Which houses are owned by the lord of the constellation? What are the matters
signified by those houses. The dasa - lord </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">D</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> will predominantly offer those results indicated by the Houses
owned by the lord of the constellation in which the dasa lord was posited at
birth. Suppose a person is born in Leo. Taurus is the 10th sign. suppose
Meridian is in the beginning of Taurus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Planets in Karthikai ruled by lagnadhipathi
give or affect health depending on the sub. One comes out victorious or loses
miserably depending on the sub. Planets in Rohini, give changes, threatens
loss, or repays loan or invests on property, issues cheques or goes on
pilgrimage lives in secluded place or is admitted in the hospital or given a
room in the prison. Because Rohini is ruled by Moon who owns the 12th house.
The sub decides whether the results are desirable or undesirable. Planets in
Mrigasira governed by Mars owning houses 4 and 9 give higher education,
processional study, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose to the same Leo - born a planet is
in the 12th house Cancer, in Ashlesha ruled by Mercury which owns the houses 2
and 11, he will make profits by speedy turn over, gets married, has a child
born, makes new friendship and realises his ambition.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also imagine that a planet, even Mercury
lord of 2 and 11, in exaltation in 2 to Leo, is in Hastham star, he enjoys such
results - mostly - as is indicated by the planet in Rohini. [Readers must
observe, study and ultimately agree. One sharebroker lost all he had during
Mercury dasa [Lagna Leo-Mercury in Virgo in 10 - 36']</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) If the sub occupied by the planet 'D',
the dasanatha, belongs to a benefic, there is no disappointment. The native
realises it. But if the sub belongs to a malefic, in its conjoined period, it
does harm, it denies, disappoints and causes anxiety, misery, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) If the dasa lord is a benefic and the
bhukti lord is also a benefic, as judged above, and if they form, according to
Western system good aspects among themselves, one enjoys.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) If the dasa lord 'D' is a benefic
according to its occupation of a constellation belonging to a planet, owning
good houses and if it forms evil aspect with another benefic, in the subperiod
of the latter in the dasa of 'D', every matter will appear to be advantageous
but ultimately, one cannot enjoy any beneficial result. It will cause delay; it
will deny and disappoint.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) If the dasa lord is a malefic by
occupying the constellation of an evil planet, and the bhukti lord is similarly
a melefic their good aspect is dangerous. It is similar to two common enemies
agree to cooperate with each other, become friends and both jointly attack the
native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(h) If the dasa lord is a malefic and it
receives adverse aspect from another malefic, the ultimate result is favourable
to the native during their conjoined period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) Do not be carried away by kendra, kona,
shasta ashtama and so on. The above rules strictly observed will prove to be
correct, provided the cusps are also included.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(j) The cusp receiving good aspect improves
the matters of the house. The cusp exclusively indicates that house matters
alone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But planets, in any manner connected with
the matters of those houses have something more to offer, by lordship, by
constellation, sub and house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, if one judges, one can get the clue
even in twin births where their experiences are opposite.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the text books available, the literature
is not sufficient to categorically predict the events in 'A' dasa and 'B'
bhukti. Such rules which are available, unfortunately, fails in the case of
births at short intervals in the same Lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The general rules given in Paladeepika by
Mantreswara are as follows </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> (These are general. But
K.P. does not advocate these, as they fail)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Results of Dasas of Planets in

6th, 8th or 12th house will cause during his dasa death or misery to the
brothers of the native. Bad thoughts will always cross his mind. He will
experience secret inimical activities, insults and loss of pride through
respected persons.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) During the dasa of the lord of the 4th
house, if afflicted, the native's mother will suffer from illness. He will
receive news of death of near and dear relatives. There will be sale of house

will cause danger, to the child of the native. He will experience mental
affliction. He will be the victim of deception. He will have disease of the
stomach. He will incur royal displeasure. There will be loss of energy. He will
be roaming about.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(6) The lord of a weak 6th house, during
his dasa will cause fear through robbers. There will be danger and
imprisonment. He will commit sinful acts. He will be engaged in servile acts.
He will receive insults. He will have bodily injury. He will experience loss of

strength, will cause to the native, during his period, sorrow through his
son-in-law. He will be away from his wife. He will experience danger through

will cause evil results to the native. He will incur the wrath of his family
deity. Danger will be caused to his wife and children, father and preceptor. He
will be disposed to do vile acts. He will be stricken with poverty.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(10) A weak 10th house lord during his
period will make the native engage himself in unproductive and fruitless
activities. The native will experience loss of reputation. He will have evil
disposition. He will live in a foreign place. He will undergo danger through

misery through brothers. He will be stricken with poverty. He will suffer from

there will be all round decrease in wealth and prosperity to the native. He
will suffer from increased illness. He will experience loss of reputation. He
will undergo danger like the waning Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. (1) A planet that has attained
Vargottamamsa will do good during its dasa. If that planet is eclipsed or in
debilitation, mixed results will be enjoyed during the dasa of that planet. If
that planet happens to be the lord of 6th, 8th or 12th house then bad results
are to be predicted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) During the dasa of a malefic planet,
the bhukti of the lord of the 3rd, 5th and 7th star to the star of birth and
the bhukti of the lords of 1st and 8th houses will cause misery through robber
and the enemy and the native will undergo lot of troubles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Counting from the Dasa of the native at
the time of birth, if the 4th dasa be Saturn, the 6th Jupiter, the 5th Mars or
Rahu, then these dasas will prove harmful. Likewise, the dasa of a planet at
the end of a Rasi (i.e. if posited at 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US">) and the dasa
of the Lord of 6th, 8th or 12th house will be harmful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) If Capricorn happens to be the 10th or
11th house and if Mars were to be posited therein which is its house of
exaltation, then during the dasa of this planet the native will have all-round
prosperity, victory over enemies and vehicular comforts. He will command an
army, will attain high status in life and will have a charitable disposition.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note: Natives born in Aries and Pisces will
have Capricorn as the 10th &amp;11th houses respectively. If in their horoscope
Mars were to be posited in Capricorn and if Mars dasa, be not the 5th dasa,
then the results enumerated above will be enjoyed by the native during Mars
dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) If Venus is posited in his exaltation
sign Pisces and if Pisces happened to be the 12th,10th or 11th house then,
during Venus dasa, if he is not eclipsed or associated with malefics, the
native will enjoy good reputation, will possess great wisdom and intellect,
will obtain costly ornaments and pearls and will be very wealthy and popular.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note: The above result is applicable to the
natives who have Aries, Taurus or Gemini as Lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(6) Benefic planets in debilitation or
posited in the 6th, 8th or 12th house will give inauspicious results during
their dasas. Malefic planets similarly situated will give inescapable misery
during their Dasas.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note: From the above the inference is that
the inauspicious results effected by benefic planets could be warded off by
performance of Shanti whereas the misery caused by malefic planets will
certainly have to be experienced and cannot be warded off by performance of
Shantis, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(7) During the Bhukti of a planet who is
inimical to Dasa lord or who is posited in enemy</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s camp
of the Dasa lord or who is inimical to Lagna lord the native will experience
fear from enemy. There will be change of dwelling or profession. Even the
erstwhile friend will turn out to be an enemy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(8) During the period of the Bhuktinatha,
the result experienced will be that of the Bhava in which the Bhukthinatha is
placed, counted from the house of the Dasanatha. If the enemy</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s camp of the Dasa lord happens to be 6th, 8th or 12th house, the
native will have inauspicious results. If in other houses, the results will be
good.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(9) If a planet is posited in his house of
exaltation, Moolathrikona, own house, friend</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s house,
enemy</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s camp or in debilitation, the auspicious results
experienced by the native will be full, three quarters, half quarter, very
little and negligible, respectively. If the planet is to give inauspicious
results, then the proportion given above will be reversed, i.e. in the house of
exaltation inauspicious result is zero, in Moolathrikona very little, own house
one - fourth friend</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s house one - half, enemy</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s camp three quarters and in debilitation full. Further, if the
planet is eclipsed, the result that will be obtained will be as for the planet
in debilitation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(10) Death will occur to the native during
the period of the planet which is the weakest of the following and when Saturn
transists evil signs : -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) Saturn, Gulika, Rahu, Lord of 22nd
Drekkana (counted from the Drekkana at the time of the birth), Lord of 8 or,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ii) Lord of Navamsa of Saturn, Gulika,
Rahu, Lord of 22nd Drekkana and Lord of 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(11) Death will occur to the native during
the period in the strongest of the following and when Jupiter transits the
trine of the sign and navamsa of the lord of 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of sign and navamsa in which the lord
of 8 is posited, lord of 22nd Drekkana and Janma Drekkana.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(12) During the dasas of Jupiter, if the
lord of Chandra lagna and the lord of Janmalagna occupy kendra positions, the
result will be enjoyed in the middle of the dasa. Planets situated in
Prishtodaya Rasis will give their results at the end of the Dasa, those in
Udayodhaya rasi in the middle of the Dasa and those in Sirshodaya rasis at the
beginning of the Dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note: (i) Aries, Taurus, Cancer,
Sagittarius and Capricorn are Prishtodaya Rasis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ii) Gemini, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and
Aquarius are Sirshodaya Rasis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(iii) Pisces is Ubadhaya Rasi</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(13) The Dasa lord transiting in a Bhava
counted from the Chandra Lagna happens to be his own house, exaltation house or
friend</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s camp then he gives strength to that bhava.
Further, in nativity, if the Dasa lord was strong, he will give strength during
his dasa in whichever bhava he transits.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(14) In nativity if the Dasa lord is
eclipsed or is in debilitation or posited in enemy</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
camp, then during his dasa, he spoils the bhava in which he transits, counted
from Chandra lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(15) If Moon, during his transit passes
through the Dasa lord</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s exaltation sign, friend</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign or the 3rd, 6th, 10th, 11th, 5th, 9th and 7th house of the
Dasanatha, he will improve the auspicious results. If he transits in other
houses the results will be reversed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(16) When the Bhuktinatha, during transit,
passes its house of debilitation or enemy</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s camp or is
eclipsed, he will cause misery. On the other hand, if the Bukthinatha, during
its transit, passes through its exaltation house or own house or if he is
retrograde, he will give auspicious results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(17) When Sun transits the exaltation sign
of the lord of the benefic dasa the native will get the good results of the
dasa lord. Similarly is the case of Jupiter's transit. On the other hand, when
Sun transits the debilitation sign or enemy</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s camp of
the lord of the malefic dasa, the native will experience bad results of the
dasa lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(18) Rahu will give good or bad results
according to the good or bad effects attributed to the planet with which it is
conjoined. The planet that is conjoined with Rahu even if he be a benefic will
cause misery particularly at the end of the dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(19) The 2</span><span lang="EN-US">nd</span><span lang="EN-US"> house and
the 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house are death inflicting houses. If the lords of the 2</span><span lang="EN-US">nd</span><span lang="EN-US">
or 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house be strong and if posited in the same 2</span><span lang="EN-US">nd</span><span lang="EN-US">
or 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house then that planet will cause death during his dasa. If the
lord of 8</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> or 12</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house be very weak and if posited in 2</span><span lang="EN-US">nd</span><span lang="EN-US"> or 7</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house this planet will cause death during his dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(20) If the Lord of a quadrant be a benefic
he will give bad results during his dasa. On the other hand, if he be a
malefic, good results will accrue. If the lord of 3, 6 or 11 even though he be
a benefic he will cause only misery during his dasa. If the lord of the 8</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house happens to be the Lagna lord also, then he will give good
results during his dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(21) Kendra lord posited in Kona and a kona
lord posited in Kendra will cause yoga. These two planets during their dasas
and bhuktis will act in co-operation with each other and will give yoga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(22) All planets do not give good or bad
results attributed to their bhava during their dasas or bhuktis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(23) All planets will give good or bad
results associated with their dasas in the bhuktis of planets that are
conjoined with them, or aspect them. Also results similar to those associated
with the Dasa lord will be experienced in the Bhuktis of planets that are by
lordship placed similar to dasa lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(24) The association of a strong quadrant
or trine lord will cause yoga even though these planets become malefic by
virtue of their lordship of the other house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(25) If a strong kendra lord gets the
association of any one of kona lord, then the associated planet gives raja
yoga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(26) If the same planet be the quadrant as
well as the trine lord, then that planet cause raja yoga. If, in addition to
this, this planet gets the association of another trine lord, there is
certainly no doubt about the raja yoga result.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(27) Planets, even though they become
malefic by lordship of the 3</span><span lang="EN-US">rd</span><span lang="EN-US">, 6</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US">, 8</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> or 11</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house, will give raja yoga results according to the results
indicated in their Bhuktis if they get the association of the yoga - producing
planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(28) A trine lord, if he does not happen to
own the 3</span><span lang="EN-US">rd</span><span lang="EN-US">, 6</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> or 11</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house also, will give auspicious results during the sub period of
kendrathipathi even though the planet does not get the association of the
kendrathipathi.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(29) Jupiter and Venus by virtue of their
lordship of houses 1, 4, 7 and 10 are strong in doing harm. The harmful effects
are intensified if they also happen to occupy Marakasthanas 2 and 7; Mercury as
lord of Kendra is next to Jupiter and Venus in the order of strength in doing
harm. Next to Mercury in strength to do harm is Moon. But malefics, if they
happen to own houses 1, 4, 7 and 10 will increase the good effects.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(30) Rahu and Ketu, if posited in Kendra or
Kona, will give rajayoga based on the association of the Lord of Kendra or Kona
with the planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(31) Rahu and Ketu, if posited in an
auspicious rasi and unassociated with any other planet, will give rajayoga
