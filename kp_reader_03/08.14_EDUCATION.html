year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Significator of the third house shows one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s inclination to specialise any subject or desire to read that
subject as is indicated by the 3rd house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Significator of the 9th house gives taste

and industry.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun conjunction with Mercury or in the
Constellation or sub of Mercury causes Nipuna Yoga. But it does not mean that
he is to qualify himself with some degree, so also people having no Nipuna Yoga
can be double-degree holders. Further, a few are under wrong impression that
Mercury when in rapt conjunction or when eclipsed cannot give education.
Actually Chief Engineers, Auditor generals, greatest mathematicians, wranglers,
intelligent Income Tax Officials are having Mercury in rapt conjunction or
eclipsed or retrograde.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One is to consider the sublord of the
ascendant to find out whether one will be studious or lazy: Mercury and Jupiter
give the mind to study and offer facilities. Saturn as a Significator of 3,
throws obstacles while one studies and during examination time, one arrives
late to the hall and remembers many points only after handing over the answer
paper and leaving the hall.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out in which subject one will be
proficient, one has to judge the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 9th and 10th houses.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_EDUCATION_1"><span lang="EN-US">1. Astrology</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury, Being the Significator of angular

intellect and imagination. One will seriously contemplate, plan and scheme,
well in advance, during the periods of the planets in Cancer or Capricorn. One
is a great critic, if Gemini or Sagittarius is occupied by the significator at
11</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Methodical approach,
cogency and coherence if occupied at 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> of Aries or
Libra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">K.P. -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter gives knowledge in Law: Mercury
offers eloquency and fluency: Mars stands for analysis, assertion, logic quick
wit, argumentative faculty, penetration and authoratative speech.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sublord of the Cusps of 4 and 9 indicate
Mars, Mercury sub gives audacity; Mars in Jupiter sub shows that without much
of legal knowledge, by commonsense and threatening the opponent, one becomes a
successful cross examiner eliciting the truth and getting favourable points. I
know two criminal lawyers who do not possess much of legal knowledge, but by
such action, they always appear in rape cases and even save their clients.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_EDUCATION_4"><span lang="EN-US">4. Engineering</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One is to be good in mathematics, drawing
and planning. Mars and Mercury produce Engineering students having taste in
Mechanical, or Civil Engineering including construction of building, erection
of machinery, factory Structural and Architectural Engineering.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus and Mercury show Sanitary Engineering
or chemical Engineering or Electrical Engineering or Automobile Engineering.

Chemical Engineering; manufacturing poison; Moon, Saturn and Mars-excavation,
mine or trenches, construction of dam or bridge etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus depending on the connection which
Mercury has, one is to ascertain, in which branch, he will specialise, Mercury,
or the planets occupying the two signs of Mercury or the 3 stars (Ashlesha,
Jyeshta, Revati) produce Engineering Students.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_EDUCATION_5"><span lang="EN-US">5. Medicine</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun is called </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Dhanvanthri,

their constellation or sub also make one proficient in Physics.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_EDUCATION_14"><span lang="EN-US">History</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon, Mercury and Jupiter indicate History.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Education is Successful if the lord of 4
and lord of 9 are in the Sub of significator of 11. Planets in any manner
connected with lords of 4 and 11 give education. Even if one discontinues one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s study, yet if planets receiving good aspect from the lords of 4
and 9 or lords of 4 and 9 receiving good aspect from planets in the
constellation of the occupant in 11, or the occupant in 11 or lord of 11 give
further education, after a break.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Education ends during the periods and
subperiods of the planets in the constellation of the occupant of the houses 3
or 5 or 8 or the occupants of the houses 3 or 5 or 8 or the planets in the
constellation of the lords of 3 or 5 or 8 or the lords of the houses 3 or 5 or
8. Malefic Saturn is detrimental. Rahu does not prove to be bad. It gives
education when it is in the constellation of the planets connected with the
houses 4 and 9.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_EDUCATION_15"><span lang="EN-US">Competive examination</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars, Mercury and Jupiter promise success
if they are connected with 4, 9 and 11.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_EDUCATION_16"><span lang="EN-US">Scholarship for study</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The fourth house indicates whether one will
study at all. The ascendant or the Lagna denotes the person. The 8th house
represents the school where he may study. The 7th house shows the teacher. The
houses 8 and 12 connected with the 4th house and vice versa indicate that one
will pay the fees, etc. and study. But the 4th having connection with the 6th
and the 11th houses indicate scholarship.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 7th house will indicate the person to
whom or the institutions to which you have to pay or the person from whom or
the institution from which you have to receive.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Scholarship is a non-repayable loan.
Generally the 6th house is judged for a loan. Why? As the seventh house
represents one who lends money to you, the vyaya house, the 12th to the 7th
shows that he has to lose or he has to withdraw that amount which he gives as
loan and there will be a deterioration in his bank position to that extent to
which he issues the cheque. But it is an income to the native. His bank
position or the money on hand increases by that amount which he takes as a
loan.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, the institution is entitled to
take money from the students. But if one is given a scholarship, it means the
institution loses through that student and pays the fees for him. Rather, the
institution gives that amount to the student as a loan which need not be
returned at all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the 4th house should be connected
with the 6th house, i.e., the planet in 4 may be in the constellation of the
occupant in the 6th house or the lord of the sixth house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house indicates benefit, profit,
gains, etc. Since, scholarship is a non-refundable one, it is a profit and the
house of education will have connection with the 11th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8th house occupied by benefics indicates
that the native will pay and study as the benefic is in the second house to the
seventh.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th house shows expenses. So the native is
to spend and study. If the 4th house, Jupiter and Mercury are connected with
12th house he pays the fees and studies. But if the 12th house, is connected
with Venus or the lord of 3, he pays, for his conveyance, though he may enjoy
scholarship. If the 12th house is connected with Mars and 3rd house, he may
shift to a hostel, pay for boarding and lodging but will receive scholarship.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take the horoscope of a native who
is given scholarship and who is now studying in America.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The person was born on a Tuesday ruled by
Mars, in Scorpio ascendant, ruled by Mars, in Aries Rasi (where Moon was at the
time of birth) owned by Mars on 28th March 1933 at 10-23 p.m.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="554" src="img/image035.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of birth, Balance of Venus Dasa
was 19 years and 3 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Till he completed M.B.B.S. and then M.D. he
had been paying and studying at school and college. But during Moon dasa Saturn
Bhukti he got the scholarship and went overseas for study.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Why should he get a benefit then and go
overseas?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon, the lord of 9, indicating long
journey and higher studies was in the constellation of Venus owning the 12th
house. So a long journey and life in a foreign place for further study are
indicated by Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn owns the 4th house. It has to give a
regular course of study. It is in the 3rd house: so a thorough change in
surroundings and environment is indicated. It aspects the 9th house and the
12th house. Hence it influences these houses and matters signified by these
houses are enjoyed. I.e., a long journey and life in a foreign place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The above reasons explain his further study
in foreign place. Why should he get a scholarship?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn which is the ruler of the 4th house
indicates his study. It is in the constellation of Moon which was in the sixth
cusp in his horoscope. When the 7th house indicates school and the 6th shows
expense to them or scholarship to the student. Moon gives scholarship to him,
at a time when the planet in the constellation of Moon operates. Actually he
received the order during Moon Dasa, Saturn Bhukti on a Pushyam star day ruled
by Saturn in the Cancer (the Moon</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign and left India
on a Sravanam star day (governed by Moon in Saturn</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
sign Capricorn) at the time Moon just passed the position of Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, the research students of
astrology may collect the horoscope of the students who are given scholarship
and find out in which Dasa and Bhukti he was first offered the scholarship and
judge how the Dasanatha and Bhuktinatha are connected with the houses 4 and 6
or 4, 6, and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following is the horoscope of the
Editor of this book who received Scholarship while he was studying in the St.
Joseph</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s College, Trichy:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="559" src="img/image036.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The balance of Moon dasa is 8 years and 2
months. The scholarship was awarded during Rahu Dasa, Rahu Bhukti, Mars Anthra
in August, 1926, and Rahu was in the star of Mars, lord of 4 and 11 and it
represents Mercury, the lord of 6 and 9 by occupying Gemini.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.13_CONVEYANCE.html">← CONVEYANCE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.14_EDUCATION">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.15_FARM AND FUTURE.html">FARM AND FUTURE →</a></div></body>
