<body><h2 id="heading_08.40_POLITICS_0"><span lang="EN-US">POLITICS</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Politics is not Poly Tricks played for one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s prosperity. But it a science of or a treatise on the organisation
of a nation and execution of the policy after discussion for the welfare of the
nation and not the native alone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As one is to live happily in this world and
enjoy Ika Loka-Sukha-Venus, the chief governor for worldly pleasures is called
one of the ministers of the celestial bodies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since the uplift of the soul and Para-Lokha
Sadhana are the ultimate aims, Jupiter, the karaka for these is said to be the
minister of the celestial bodies. If a person is said to be the chief
representative of the public, Mercury, called winged messenger of God or agent,
should indicate in one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s chart whether he will be a
member, a councilor, a mayor, a minister and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As ministers are empowered with power and
authority, Mars must be well placed and strong.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As ministers hold the position of trust,
Saturn also must be beneficially posited and strong.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A politician needs mostly oration,
convincing tactics, popularity and mainly fortune to come out successful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One can be a good orator, if Jupiter and
Mercury are favourable and If Mars is auspicious then he can place before the
public, the facts in meticulous detail, analyse and explain, whether one is
right or wrong, one will be capable of convincing the people and carry the mass
with him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Vaidhyanatha Dikshita says in Jataka
Parijatha that one can become a minister:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) If Sun, Mars, Mercury and Saturn are
conjoined, the person will be a minister. (If you want to apply Krishnamurti
Padhdhati: Sun in Saturn sign, Mars star, Mercury sub or Mercury in Aquarius in
Sun Sub, in Mars star, or in Anuradha star governed by Saturn, in Mars sign and
the sub belonging to either Sun or Mercury at the time of birth makes one a
minister in the period or sub period of the occupant).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) If Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and
Saturn are conjoined in a House (not a sign) they make the person a minister.
[According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati: Venus in Jupiter sign, Mercury star, Moon
sub, aspected by Saturn by 3rd aspect produces the above result; or Saturn in
Mercury sign, Jupiter star, Moon sub aspected by Venus causes the above effect;
or Saturn in Venus sign, Moon star, Venus sub aspected by Mercury etc. can give
the above results. They need not be conjoined. What results are promised by
conjunction will be produced by being situated in a position where the sign
lord, star lord and sub lord are the same planets.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Jupiter in 9 contributes: aspect of
Mars is also beneficial.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Three planets in their own sign
(Swakshetra) makes one a minister. He or she may be tactful, diplomatic and
clever or cunning and hypocrite.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Sanketanidhi, Ramadayalu says that one
becomes a minister even in youth, if lord of 5 is in 4. He will be honest.
(Lord of 5 in the constellation of lord of 4 is good).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Horasara, Prithuyasas says that Sun in
the 6th house makes one a minister. So also Jupiter in 6, or Venus in 5, or
Venus in 10 gives a lift to the person to become a minister.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also he says that when all the benefics are
situated in 3 or 6 or 10 or 11 and the malefics in 1 or 10, one can become the
chief minister.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Jataka dasa marga, Podumanni Chomadiri
says that benefics in 6, 7 and 8 counted from the sign occupied by Moon,
causing Chandra Adhiyoga makes one a minister. So also one born in Lagnadhiyoga
will be benefitted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He also adds that lord of 10 in exaltation
makes one a minister.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mantreswara in Phaladeepika mentions that
Mercury makes one a good politician. The 5th house is to be judged to find out
whether one can become a minister and also Jupiter, Sun and Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To become a minister or a politician, first
of all, one should be lucky. One need not be rich to spend money on elections.
One need not be educated much. Among ministers do not we see engineers,
doctors, lawyers, teachers, officials, business people, etc. Caste and creed do
not count excepting in certain cases.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As per Krishnamurti Padhdhati, Fortune to
become a minister is to be judged as follows. Cusps of the Houses 1, 6, 9 and
10 should receive beneficial aspects. The occupants of those houses must be in
the constellation of benefics by lordship and the sub is to be ruled by such
benefics connected with houses 1, 6, 9, 10 and 11. House 1 shows that he enjoys
the benefit. 6th house promises failure and loss to the opponent, thereby
victory over enemies. 9th house is the bank position of the meritorious deed done
in the previous birth, thereby there is the Bagya, the Providential help etc.
10th house indicates name, fame, reputation, popularity and profession. 11th
house promises success in election, realisation of ambition and fulfilment of
one's desire. Thus one is to judge.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">[How planets portray the ministers
resigning with black mark, ministers re-entering service again, ministers
resigning honourably on a policy with prestige, ministers again called for to
occupy a better position, changes in their portfolio, lift in rank, honest or
otherwise will be discussed in my magazine Astrology and Ahrishta.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">49' N</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">85</span>°<span lang="EN-US">1' E</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dated 6-12-1968.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Sir,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Please refer to your letter dated 10-12-67
