<body><h2 id="heading_08.30_INDEPENDENT BUSINESS_0"><span lang="EN-US">INDEPENDENT BUSINESS</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The horoscope is as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="474" src="img/image057.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun dasa balance 2 years 10 months 11 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On 11-5-1970, Jupiter dasa has started.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For business, judge houses 2, 7 and 10. The
second house shows self-acquisition. The seventh denotes customers and
partners. It gives good indication about the nature of the people with whom you
will have to deal; houses 6 and 7 indicate those from whom you buy; 7 and 12
denote those to whom you sell.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, one is to note the dasa period
which one runs. Because in one period and sub period, one may be in service; in
another subperiod in the same major period keep idle; in the third subperiod do
business; in the next subperiod, have gains, in another lose and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence one is to note what each planet can
contribute. Always consider the sublord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Western authors say that Saturn in the 7th
house is not favourable to undertake any business. But according to
Krishnamurti Padhdhati Saturn sub occupied by lord of 7 or significator of 7 is
disadvantageous for a successful business. Opposition and loss in public
affairs are threatened. Whether there is success or not, whether one will do
business, is to be judged from the significator of 7 and the 7th cusp sublord.
Mars gives one the courage to undertake. Mercury shows one's tact, skill,
ability and publicity. Venus indicates that due to his sweet smile, pleasing
words and social success by being a Lion, a Rotary Club member, or Cosmopolitan
Club member, or a member in any club or society, due to friendship and contact,
one can be successful; if Venus is evil, it will spoil him due to disposition
one is to judge how one can thrive or will meet with loss and failure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, planets occupying earthy signs
make a person businesslike and care for material welfare by doing business. If
the earthy sign happens to be 12 or 5 or 8, and the sublord of the 7th cusp is
in 5 or 8 or 12 in the earthy sign, one loses. If the significator of the 7th
house is in the sub of a planet who is either by occupying the 5th house or
deposited in the constellation of a planet in 5 or 8 or 12, winds up business
due to loss.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this chart, 7th cusp is in 4</span>—<span lang="EN-US">44' in Pisces. It is in Saturn's star and Saturn's sub. Further,
Saturn is in earthy sign in 5 to the ascendant i.e. in 11 to 7.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">No planet is in 7. Lord of the sign in
which 7th cusp falls is Jupiter. It is in the sub of Saturn in 5. Hence
business is no good to this person.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As neither the dasanath, nor the sublord is
connected with Mars, this native will not have the courage to start a business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Neither there is opportunity, nor there
can be success if he does independently the business</span>”<span lang="EN-US">
is the promise of the planets. This person will not do business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since years, he wants to do </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> At the same time he is funky. Yet he has not started (K.S.K.
3-7-71)</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.29_PROFESSION.html">← PROFESSION</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.30_INDEPENDENT BUSINESS">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.31_MUSIC.html">MUSIC →</a></div></body>
