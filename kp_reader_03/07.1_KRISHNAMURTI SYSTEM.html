into twelve equal parts; each division is called a Solar mansion (or Rasi or
Sign)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">They are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Hindus have another division also. The
Zodiac is divided into twenty seven equal parts, each measuring 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20'. They commence from Aries 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and end by
Pisces 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. The 27 divisions are called Lunar Mansions
(Nakshatras, Asterisms, Stars Constellations). They are called Ashwini,
Bharani, Krithigai, Rohini... Uthrapathrapada and Revathi.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The explanation that I can offer why they
have taken 9 planets and divided the Zodiac into 27 Nakshatras is as follows:
The Zodiac is 360</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in Longitude. What is the sanctity
in the number 360. Probably, Sun moves in between the stars, in its path the
Ecliptic - daily on a average about 1/360</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> of the
circle. So, every day in 24 hours Sun moves 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US">.
Further, 360 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10 when it will be easy
for other calculations. It is first divided into 3 equal parts of 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> each. The four signs Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer make up 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in the segment AEL. The next four signs Leo, Virgo, Libra and
Scorpio form 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and they are in the segment LES;
Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are the last 4 signs in the segment
SEA measuring 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(A is Aries 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US">, S
is Sagittarius 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and E is earth.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All planets moving from the point A (Vernal
Equinox) Aries Mesha according to Nirayana System-get their results modifiec as
they move in the Zodiac. In the first 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' i.e. 0
degree tc 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' and planet transiting in Mesha
(Aries) will be influencec by Kethu, and the constellation is called Ashwini.
Then when it passes on, between 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' and 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-40' Venus influences it; this area is called Bharani. Between 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-40' and 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> of Aries and 0</span>°</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Taurus to 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
Taurus, the planets results will be modified by Sun. Karthigai is the name of
the star, or constellation which I call as Zone. Then from 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Taurus to 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' Moon modifies the results
of the planet occupying this Zone or Lunar Mansion called Rohini. Between 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' in Taurus and 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Taurus as well as 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Gemini to 6</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-40' in Gemini, the mansion
called Mrigasirisha is ruled by Mars and the planet in this Zone will be under
the control of Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The next 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20'
called Arudhra, is governed by Rahu; next Punarvasu is ruled by Jupiter (Guru).
It is followed by Pushya and Ashlesha governed by Saturn and Mercury
respectively.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, from Simha 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> (Leo) upto the end of Scorpio, the four sings are divided into 9
lunar mansions (called Nakshatras, Stars or Constellations). They are called
Makam, Poorvapalguni, Utharpalguni, Hastham, Chithrai, Swathi, Visakam,
Anuradha and Jyesta which are ruled by 9 planets in the same order, viz. Kethu,
Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars (Sevvai, Mangal, Angaraka, Kuja) Rahu, Jupiter (Guru),
Saturn (Sani) and Mercury (Budha).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The remaining 1/3 of a Zodiac SA contains
the 4 signs Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces and the nine
constellations in it are Moolam, Poorvashada, Uthrashada, Sravana, Dhanishta,
Sathabisha, Poorvapathrapada, Uthrapathrapada and Revathi. The planets Kethu,
Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury rule the stars in the
same order.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, planets in between 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' in Aries (Aswini), 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' in Leo (Makam), and 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' in Sagittarius (Moolam) will be
under the sway of Kethu; 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' in Aries to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-40' (Bharani), 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' in Leo to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-40' (Poorvapalguni,) 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-40' in Sagittarius (Poorvashada) these three zones are ruled by
Venus and Planets transitting in these zones are under the influence of Venus
and the results of Venus will be offered by the planet, transitting in this
zone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, each planet governs three zones in
the Zodiac. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a planet, were to be in Aswini, another
in Makam and the third in Moolam, all are under the influence of Kethu and are
in Kethu's zone. If the astrologer says that a planet is modified by the lord
of the constellation, Kethu, then the statement is not complete and clear. He
has to add, whether it is in Aries, or Leo, or Sagittarius, otherwise one
cannot locate the position of the planet correctly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a father has three sons Brahma,
Vishnu and Siva and every son gives the same order of names. Rama, Baratha,
Lakshmana, Sathrugna, Dharmaputhra, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva. The
first issue of all three are called "Rama", the second issue of each
of is called "Bharatha" and so on, and the last issue of each of them
will be "Sahadeva". If a postman has to deliver a letter with the
address Rama alone, how can he exactly fix up to which Rama it refers. The
moment he calls out Rama, three Ramas will respond. Instead, suppose all the 27
children are given different names, like Aswini, Bharani etc., how easy it is
to identify.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, instead of calling each lunar
mansion as Keth (Aswini), Kethu 2 (Makam), Kethu 3 (Moolam), Venus 1 (Bharani
Venus 2 (Poorani), Venus 3 (Pooradam), and so on, or as Ket in Mesha-Aries,
Kethu in Simha-Leo, Kethu in Dhanus (Sagittari) and so on; the ancients gave
different names to all the 27 stars (27 zones of 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20')
commencing from Aswini and ending with Revathi.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">They were aware that the stars are not
equally elongated from 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' and then another from 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20' to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-40' and so on. The Zodiac does not give the appearance of a
circular wheel made of a cane with 27 rings in it. But the Zodiac is a
imaginary pathway in the heavens. 360</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in length and 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in width with stars scattered all over, in and outside the Zodiac,
and the stars appear as dots and not rods. The constellations selected by our
sages are either a group of stars or any single bright star so that they can be
first identified easily.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Page 19 Table</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A few of them are in the Zodiac itself but
the majority of the groups are around the constellations which are named after
these groups. These stars (constellations) may be very close to the 27
divisions of the Zodiac or far away, and they may be either to the North or to
the South of the Zodiac. A few groups are very near and in the next
constellation and they will be chosen because they can be identified easily and
they will be useful for reference and calculation to locate where a particular
constellation would commence and end in the Heavens; further, there is no other
constellation within or near the zone which can be unmistakably identified.
Therefore, these 27 stars are to guide us, so that we can calculate and
ascertain the position of the 27 zones in the Zodiac, each measuring 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">-20'.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These 27 constellations are governed by the
9 planets. Hence, each planet rules over three zones at an interval of 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> (e.g.) KETHU </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Aswini, Makam, Moolam, VENUS
(Sukra) </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These zones modify the results of the
planets transitting the Zodiac and not the stars, scattered in the Heavens
which are far, far away. Planets are the immediate neighbours of our Mother
Earth and these belong to one family. Probably this is the reason why he has
selected only 27 groups of stars even though there are numberless stars in the
sky which can influence the earth as much as these 27 groups.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose (a) there is a light in the centre
of a circular room provided with 12 glass panes of different colours (b) around
the room there is a verandah and outside it, there are 27 glass panes of which
the colour, 1, 10 and 19, is the same; 2, 11 and 20 differ from 1, 10, 19 but
these three are of the same colour; 3, 12 and 21; differ from others but these
three of the same colour as they belong to one group. Similarly, all the 27
panes are of 9 different colours.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a person walks outside the circular
verandah looking at the light inside, he will find the colour of the light
getting changed according to the colour of the coloured panes. Similarly, the
results of the planets are modified by the lord of the sign and indicated by
the lord of the Nakshathra or constellation.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a planet is compared to a torch light
then the influence of the sign</span>–<span lang="EN-US">Solar Mansion occupied
by it and the influence of the Zones of 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> called stars, change the colour of the light. Suppose a railway
guard shows the light, It may be plain or green or red according to the
background mirror.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="165" src="img/image001.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, imagine that the mirror used
behind the bulb is the lord of the sign. It may be clear and it may illuminate
to a maximum or it may be dull rendering the light, weak. The strength and
modification of the colour depends, on the mirror behind the bulb (which is the
reflector) which denotes whether a planet is exalted and strong or debilitated
and weak.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also suppose one coloured slide is inserted
between the torch light and the observer this colour depends on the lord of the
constellation </span>“<span lang="EN-US">C</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> when </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">P</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> is the planet (which is the bulb).  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, the results of a planet in
different positions in the Zodiac, in different signs and different
constellations, is similar to the light from the torch getting modified and the
resultant becoming absolutely different from the original light, unless all the
colours are similar to that of the planet.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In my researches, I found that one should
not satisfy himself with the modification of the lord of the constellation
alone. But one has to find out further subdivisions, which should be
scientific, so that one can explain the differences between twin births.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So I have divided each star in a manner
which will be explained shortly. Suppose, we do not subdivide, then we offer
prediction taking into consideration, the situation of a planet in a particular
sign and star. It will be similar to saying that a particular dasa of a person
will be brilliant. The dasa lord may be Venus. It will run for 20 years. Even,
though, in general, these 20 years might have proved to be beneficial, yet
there would have been occasions when he could have had difficulties, trials and
tribulations also, but these difficulties, trials and beneficial results, may
not be much. It may be similar to a person being foretold that he would gain in
a race on a particular day. No doubt he may lose in the first race, lose in the
second, gain in the third, again lose in the fourth and gain in the last few
races. When we calculate, we may find that he had gained on that particular
day. But consider his anxiety whenever he lost, especially in the first two
races. It is similar to taking a planet, the sign and the star in which it was
and passing judgment. But according to </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Krishnamurti
System</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> it will be possible to say that he will gain at
a particular time and also conclude that it is a day of profit. This method of
forecast is not merely advantageous, but correct and convincing as well.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a person is told that during Venus
Dasa, he will be fortunate. No doubt during Venus Dasa, Venus Bhukthi he gets
married. Venus dasa Sun Bhukthi he starts business; Venus dasa, Moon Bhukthi he
goes overseas; Venus dasa, Mars Bhukthi he has a son, Venus dasa Jupiter
Bhukthi there is expansion in the business and he has another child. During
Venus dasa, Saturn Bhukthi there is some labour trouble and minor losses. In
Venus dasa, Mercury Bhukthi he opens branches, takes up agencies and during
Venus dasa, Kethu Bhukthi he visits various pilgrim centres. On the whole, no
doubt, the person get married, started business, went overseas, expanded
business and stabilized it. Also, one would not forget that he had lost a
member of the family, had labour trouble, suffered some loss and had worries
for some time. If a person is informed that in these 20 years, Venus will cause
Rajayoga it will not help him much. But indeed, it would be useful only when he
is informed both; the time of event and also the nature of event, both good and
bad. So, the dasa of 20 years is subdivided into subperiods otherwise called
bhukthis.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the same analogy, I established that the
division of a constellation was necessary if correct results are to be
forecast.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a person is informed that he will
have very good business and profit on a particular day, he feels depressed till
2 P.M.., as there was no business till then and in these hours he loses his
faith in astrology; but the planets so adjust that a few marriage parties enter
his shop and make purchases from him for an amount much greater than what he
had been normally collecting daily. If the same astrologer could tell him that
only between 2 and 4 P.M; on that day he would do excellent business, would have
been advantageous for both. So, the subdivision of the constellation are an
imperative necessity to predict exact time of event.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again, as a result of intensive research,
it has been possible to find out why a person receiving a few letters on a day
in a particular moment, feels very happy when he goes through the contents of a
latter, next feels dejected and depressed when he reads the other, gets
irritated when he goes through the third and so on. It was found that the
Ascendant and the cusp of the houses move faster than the planets and it is the
ascendant and the cusp of the houses which explain such rapid changes, though
the relative position among planets and their occupation of the star and sub
remain the same.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ascendant can move in a sign for about
2 hours but in a constellation, it can only be for about 50 to 58 minutes. But
certain events may happen within an interval of 10 or 15 minutes. Therefore,
there should be some other minute factor which brings about varying results in
a very short time. So it was found that the ascendant in that constellation
(Star) showed that he would receive letters. But to indicate which moment he
would read a pleasant letter, which moment he would read a letter which would
irritate him and so on, further divisions of the constellation was necessary.
This method was found to be convincing and scientific.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take another example. Suppose, we
judge the results according to the transit of the planets. It is generally
stated that Saturn while transitting the 11th house will produce most desirable
results.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn will be passing through the 11th
house, roughly for a period of two and a half years. Saturn signifies certain
matters to the person according to his chart and only such of those matters
alone will be expected by him. It is not uncommon (1) that for a long time
after the entry of Saturn into the 11th house, the person continues to suffer
and is not able to reconcile (2) some actually suffer all the time whereas they
enjoy when Saturn transits in the 12th sign. When Saturn is in 11, what
actually one will enjoy or experience depends on the lord of the constellation
and the lord of the sub, according to Krishnamurti System and this would
explain why the general rule fails.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First of all, I would like to say
emphatically that all persons having Saturn in 11 cannot expect favourable
results because the ascendant may be different and the lords of the
constellations in the 11th house may be ruling evil houses to that lagna - born.
Thereby the person will experience difficulties through the source indicated by
Saturn (the transiting planet). But, according to my technique, when Saturn is
passing in a constellation, throughout that period, he neither enjoys nor
suffer uniformly but during certain periods he finds beneficial results
compensating for the difficulties. The method which I advocate will prove to be
very correct and it can never fail; because, I take the subdivision of the
constellation. The constellation indicates the matters signified by its lord;
the planet transiting influences such results denoted by the lord of the star
through the source denoted by the transitting planet (by nature, lordship and
occupation) and it is the sub - lord which decides whether the result is
favourable or unfavourable. The lord of the constellation is similar to the
lord of a dasa of the Vimshothari system, whereas the sub is the lord of the
subperiod or Bhukthi. So, I have evolved a method to divide the constellation
based upon the sound principle of astrology, which will appeal to one and
all.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Aswini, the first sub is allotted to
Kethu, the second to Venus, the third to Sun, the fourth to Moon and so on till
the last sub is given to Mercury. Aswini is ruled by Kethu. So the first sub is
allotted Kethu.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose Moon enters a particular
constellation, say Bharani (the second star of the 27 stars), the longitude of
which extends from 13</span>°–<span lang="EN-US">20</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> to
26</span>°–<span lang="EN-US">40</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> of Aries (Mesha) and a
child is born at that moment. What do we say? Is it not that the child is to
run Venus dasa and it will have 20 years of Venus dasa left over at the time of
the birth? The child is having Venus dasa, Venus Bhukthi at the time of the
birth. If moon moves a little further, say 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> (i e 14</span>°–<span lang="EN-US">20</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> in Aries </span>–<span lang="EN-US">
Mesha), we say that the child has a balance of 18 years 6 months and also that
the child will have Venus dasa, Venus Bhukthi at the time of birth. But, when
Moon has moved 20/120 of Bharani and a child is born then, we say that the
child has a balance of 16 years 8 months and that the child is having venus
dasa, sun bhukthi just starting. If moon further moves by 16/120 of the star,
we say the child will be having Venus dasa, Mars Bhukthi. Moon moves further by
7/120 of Bharani. So, Mars sub is also over; Rahu sub - starts. Let it go on. When
it completes 18/120 of this star, Rahu sub is over and Jupiter starts. Thus it
will be seen that the Moon is influenced by the exact position which it
occupies in the constellation. Therefore, Moon in the beginning is under the
sway of Venus and the sub of Sun. Next it passed in the same constellation
belonging to Venus but to the sub of Moon. It is followed by the sub of Mars,
then by Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, and lastly by Kethu. So according to
Krishnamurti System each constellation is subdivided into 9 parts. They are not
equal in the longitude but the longitude of each sub is in the proportion in
which they are allotted the total number of years in Vimshothari dasa
system.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The longitude of each constellation is
13°–20’ equal to 800 minutes. Therefore, in every constellation of 800 minutes
each planet will have an area equal to the number of years allotted to each in
the dasa multiplied by 6²⁄</span><span lang="EN-US">₃</span><span lang="EN-US"> minutes (800/120). Therefore, Sun</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sub
extends to 40 minutes (6x6</span>²⁄<span lang="EN-US">₃</span><span lang="EN-US">) whatever be the constellation. Mars and Kethu extend for 46</span>²⁄<span lang="EN-US">₃</span><span lang="EN-US">
minutes (7x6</span>²⁄<span lang="EN-US">₃</span><span lang="EN-US">). Moon extends for 1</span>°–<span lang="EN-US">6</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> - 40</span>’’<span lang="EN-US">, Saturn 2</span>°–<span lang="EN-US">6</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> - 40</span>’’<span lang="EN-US">, Rahu extends for exactly 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. Jupiter has an area of 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> - 46</span>’<span lang="EN-US">40</span>’’<span lang="EN-US">, Mercury 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> -
53</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">- 40</span>’’<span lang="EN-US">, Venus 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> - 13</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> - 20</span>’’<span lang="EN-US">. 
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Eventhough the area allotted to each planet
is the same in each star, yet the order in which they occupy the constellation
differs. To note the order, one has to find out which planet rules the
constellation, then the beginning of the constellation is used by the lord of
the star, just like in any dasa, the first sub period or bhukti is ruled by the
dasa lord. The second sub is ruled by the Bhukti lord who will follow the dasa
lord. Then in the same cycle order the subs will be ruled as in the bhukthi. 
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="165" src="img/image002.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the star is Karthika, note the lord of
the star. It is Sun. Hence, allot the first sub to Sun. In the cyclic order,
who will follow Sun? It is Moon. So the second sub is given to Moon, the third
to Mars, the fourth to Rahu and so on, till the last sub is governed by
Sukra.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="174" src="img/image003.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the star is Punarpoosam, otherwise
called Punarvasu, the first subdivision is governed by Jupiter; next by Saturn
and the last by Rahu.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="159" src="img/image004.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the star is Pushya, the lord is Saturn.
Therefore, the first sub is governed by Saturn, the second sub is ruled by
Mercury, the third is allotted to kethu and so on till the last sub is under
the sway of Jupiter.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="156" src="img/image005.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the star is Ashlesha, otherwise called
Ayilyam, the first subdivision is governed by Mercury, the next by Kethu and so
on, till the last subdivision is allotted to Saturn.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus all the twenty seven stars are divided
among the nine planets. It may appear as though the whole Zodiac is divided
into 27 multiplied by 9 parts. Actually, the lord of the sign, the lord of the
star and the lord of the sub will be 249 instead of 243, due to the change in
the sign iord (lord of the sign), as certain subs are found in 2 adjacent
signs. (Furthermore one can subdivide and record the results. This is for
research students)  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A few stars are called in different terms.
