(Matale Branch), Ceylon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(The Writer analyses the potential of
Krishnamurti system to offer candid prediction and a scientific approach. The
adoration of Shri Sivapatham for the innovation of Shri Krishnamurti is
reflected in this article.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">India has been the
"treasure-house" of Indian Culture and Vedic Studies from time
immemorial. Due to the prolonged ruie of the foreigners, the above studies,
culture and science, were crippled and lacked new spirit. Those who propagated
the study of Astrology, misused this noble science to earn their living and
none were interested in any research that led to perfectness in the practical
use of this science.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I went through all the available systems,
Western and Eastern. I was disgusted as these systems were not reliable always
for candid predictions. At this juncture, in last August 1969, I came across
"Astrology &amp; Athrishta" and "Krishnamurti Padhdhati".
At first I had a quick glance at the principles mentioned thereon and was
satisfied as I was sure that Krishnamurti Padhdhati will unlock the doors of
correct technique of prediction in this field. On further study I was delighted
as all his principles were based on stellar Position of planets according to
our origin of Astrology propagated by our ancient Yogis and Saints. Even the
texts of Maha-Baratha and Ramayana show evidence that our ancestors were guided
by the stellar positions of planets for thier predictions. It is true that all
based their principles on the movement of stars, and I can boldly say, without
fear or favour, that none had propagated a fruitful and perfect research on the
study of the above and the correct appliance of them for the future predictions
other than our Guruji-Professor K.S.Krishnamurti. Even our Saints and Yogis who
had the powers to foresee and foretell the events through meditations and
'spirits', did not produce a deep study of them. It is our Guruji who neither
takes any form of 'spirits' nor see through any 'spirits' has produced a new
scientific, simple and reliable system in his grand work Krishnamurti
Padhdhati.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In our society, we have noticed that twins
born on the same day with an interval of one or two minutes, at the same place,
having same Lagna and planetary positions, are not alike in character, health,
behaviour, actions and status etc. All these factors had opened the doors of
his research-mind, to invent or produce the theory of 'SUB' which was unknown
to anyone from the time of origin of Astrology upto the date of Krishnamurti
Padhdhati. Proper applications of ruling planets for candid predictions and rectification
of birth charts crown his scientific venture in this field of Astrology. Hence,
we are fortunate that we are in this Krishnamurti Padhdhati Era to enjoy his
fruitful results and all admit that our Guruji is the only Guruji in this world
who has shown us the correct path.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally, astrologers are wiser after
events as they use certain tranquilising words and terms to suit their
convenience and save themselves from any future embarrassments. It is quite
obvious that even some of the famous astrologers adopt some form of 'tantra' in
their predictions in a way to mislead the general masses. But, on the contrary,
our Guruji's predictions are straight forward, perfect, unequivocal and clear
in all cases.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Citizens of Madras, Delhi, Bombay, Gaya,
Bangalore, Jaipur, Mysore and other places in India are fortunate enough to get
our Guruji's aspects and blessings in this field, while we in Ceylon and other
foreign countries are deprived of same. I think, the time will come for us to
meet our Guruji in the near future. On this eventful day, let me join with you
all, to pray Lord Maha Ganapathy to bless him with Long life, good health, and
prosperity for all of us to gain more and more from him in this field.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Long live our Guruji!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ever live Krishnamurti Padhdhati</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Presented by</span></p>
