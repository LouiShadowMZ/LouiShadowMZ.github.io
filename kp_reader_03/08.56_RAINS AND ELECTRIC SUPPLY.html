<body><h2 id="heading_08.56_RAINS AND ELECTRIC SUPPLY_0"><span lang="EN-US">RAINS AND ELECTRIC SUPPLY</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rains to relieve the pains of the public
and the Government to have its normal gains is the desire of one of the Highest
officials in Madras.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Agricultural, food, water supply and the
Electricity Departments, depending on the impounded reservoirs and lakes on the
hills want timely rains.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Meteorological department is mostly similar
to a newspaper giving the particulars after the event, maximum and minimum
temperature, rainfall etc. If at all, only after a depression in the bay, they
can expect the storm. They can say how much it has rained but they cannot
foresee how much it would rain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrology, after developing it, by carrying
out a little research can clearly state, when and where, how much rain the
people can have, years, decades and centuries in advance. Research is to be
done by collecting the rainfall charts, noting down the position of planets and
applying the rules given in Brihat Samhita, to definitely state the rainfall.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is found that there will be breaches,
Engineers may be forewarned. Prevention is better than cure. A small sum spent
on reinforcing the bund of the lake and the bank of the river will save the
people from varieties of difficulties; no loss of life of the Villagers in the
inundated areas; no loss of life of animals etc.; no loss of vegetables and
other crops; no loss of building; no dislocation etc. It prevents loss and
saves money.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The water supply department can regulate
the supply.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The food department can avoid famine.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The electricity department can also make
wide publicity much in advance and regulate the supply.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If mills are closed, so much of labour
suffer without a job. The newspaper cuts the news: Publishers delay in bringing
out the books </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> (I am one of the sufferers) </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Those who want to buy electric motor for pump-sets may go in for
Diesel oil engines and irrigate their field from wells in that year. Next year
they can switch on to electric motor. What is the use of appointing one when
one knows astrologically that he will fall ill from typhoid and for a month he
will be absent. Instead appoint some one first and have your own man after he
recovers from the disease.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus astrology can be made very useful to
the Government and to the public. Indeed, some more research is needed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To-day at 11.50 A.M., one of the important
members, holding a very high position desirous of serving the public, most
anxiously phoned and wanted to know how this year will be. He asked </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Please say when there will be rain in the Nilgiris and in Mercara.
Will it be sufficient? Will it be better than last year or worse?</span>”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Please give a number within 249, Sir.</span>”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">206 please</span>”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">I shall give a ring at 1 P.M. after my
calculation</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Good or bad, please state as the planets
portray</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Certainly</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Alright</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The horoscope is as follows :-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For number 206, the Lagna will be 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">6</span>′<span lang="EN-US">40</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> in Capricorn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon represents the nature of query. It is
in its own constellation. It is a watery planet. So the question may be about
water.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Varahamihira, Garga, Parasara, Kasyappa,
Maya, Brihaspati have discussed about the Moon</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
conjunction with Rohini to predict the good and bad effects of rain. Therefore
Rohini indicates </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Rains</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To-day, it is Monday ruled by Moon
(28-2-66). The star is ruled by Moon-Rohini. The sign is governed by Venus.
Hence Venus and Moon rule the moment of query. Rohini is the star in which Lord
Krishna was born and in His Time there was plenty of milk and food. Rohini
itself suggests </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Plenty</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="506" src="img/image080.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to progression Moon conjoined
Rahu seven months ago: therefore from August and upto this time the rains were
scanty.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By progression Moon conjoins Jupiter in a
year and next year 1967 March there will be unusual, precedent, uncommon heavy
rains.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">It is a good news. But what will happen in
between?</span>”</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Benefit is denoted by 11th house. 11th
house to the 7th is the 5th house. It is occupied by Jupiter. Hence planets in
the constellation of Jupiter and Jupiter itself indicate that in their
conjoined periods and sub periods, and whenever planets transit their
constellations, there will be good rains at the time they are in the sub of the
significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is found that unusually there will be
clouds and occasional showers between 22-3-66 and 3-4-66. On 6-4-66, there will
be good rains.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Between 24-4-66 and 19-5-66, there is no
rains. Between 19-5-66 and 1-6-66, it starts raining. It increases. On 18-7-66
the lakes overflow.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Normal supply of electricity will be
resumed on 10-7-66 and there will be no cut in the near future.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further Moon conjunction, with Jupiter
indicates that there will be expansion, improvement and addition to the present
power houses. Mars, as lord of 11 aspecting Moon indicates (being a fiery
planet) that you will erect Thermal station also. Mars, conjunction Saturn and
Sun portray that from mine areas (Neyveli) you will get electricity to augment
the supply.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(All these predictions came true).</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.55_HORARY ASTROLOGY.html">← HORARY ASTROLOGY</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.56_RAINS AND ELECTRIC SUPPLY">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.57_RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME.html">RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME →</a></div></body>
