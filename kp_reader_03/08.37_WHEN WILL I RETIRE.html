<body><h2 id="heading_08.37_WHEN WILL I RETIRE_0"><span lang="EN-US">WHEN WILL I RETIRE</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Horoscope is as follows:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="530" src="img/image069.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu Dasa balance 6 years 3 months 2 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sir,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Retirement from service shows permanently
ceasing connection with the office in which you were hitherto employed and also
a thorough change in one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s surroundings and
environment. It includes, also change of one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
residence. This is applicable to Govt. Employees who surrender the quotens
allotted to them, after retirement. Therefore, the houses to be examined are 5
and 9 ie 12 (negation) to 6 and 10, ruling service and occupation, as well as
the 3rd house which is the 12th counted from 4. In your chart, 3rd house is
occupied by Rahu. Saturn and Moon are posited in Rahu</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
constellation. The fifth house is unoccupied. Its owner is Jupiter, and Mercury
alone is in Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s constellation. The ninth house is
occupied by Ketu with no other planet in its star. Thus, the significators are
Saturn, Moon, Rahu, Mercury and Ketu. So in Mercury Dasa, Saturn Bhukti, and
Mercury Anthra, when Sun, by transit, passes the position occupied at birth by
Mercury, i.e., around 20th November, 1970, will cause your retirement.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter, whose period you are now running,
happens to be lord of 2 and is deposited in the constellation ruled by Mars,
lord of 1 and 6 and hence has to benefit you financially which would not
otherwise be the case if you were to retire. Jupiter in the constellation of
lord of 6 (service) shows continuity in that respect. In fact, it is because of
Mars connection you found yourself into the Navy - Mars occupying a watery sign
and owning the 6th house aspects Saturn as well as the Moon (Mars-Moon: Navy).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, in my experience, I have found
that if two or three planets together indicate a department and also entering
into service in youth, whenever their conjoined periods operate in future there
will be definite improvement or change or retirement. In your case, the planets
which are connected with houses 3, 5 and 9 are also connected with houses 6 and
2; because Rahu is to offer the results of the planet with which it is in
conjunction or by which it is aspected. Rahu is not conjoined with any planet
but it is aspected by Mars who, by virtue of its governance over the 6th house,
denotes monetary gains as a result of service in departments connected with
Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, etc. Rahu thus gains strength to indicate the
6th house results also. I am sure that, as in the case of many other people,
the three planets - Saturn, Mercury and Moon which saw you entering service on
21-5-1941, will, in their conjoined period again (Saturn Bhukti, Mercury Dasa),
indicate retirement.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In traditional astrology, the rule is that
planets which are in shasthashtama (quincunx or 150 degree aspect according to
Western astrology) to each other, i.e., in 6 and 8 to each other, cannot offer
desirable results whenever their conjoined periods operate. Actually, you
entered service and also got married only when you were running Saturn Dasa,
Mercury Bhukti, - the two planets which are in 6 and 8 to each other. Again,
you were confirmed in the Commission when you run the bhukti of Venus which was
in 6 to dasanatha Saturn. Another planet, Sun which is also in 6 to Saturn
offered, in its bhukti, a voyage to a foreign country at the end of 1947. Also
the same Sun</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s period, before it ended, saw your
promotion. Again, in traditional astrology, planets in the 8th house threaten
untold miseries, but actually Saturn and Moon in 8 to your lagna which operated
when you entered the Navy, again caused another promotion in December 1948
(Saturn Dasa, Moon Bhukti, Saturn Anthra). Has traditional astrology been helpful
in explaining your events? You enjoyed diametrically opposite results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since Mercury Dasa, Saturn Bhukti and
Mercury Anthra is the period of retirement and Mercury is the lord of 8 and 11
houses, it shows that when one retires during Mercury Anthra one will have his
accounts settled quickly and will get his accumulated provident fund, etc. no
sooner after retirement date. (Mercury is a speedy planet and connected with
accounts, etc.) In many cases, people having accumulated arrears during Saturn
sub period have their arrears received or entangled money obtaining during Mercury
sub period.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.36_TERMINATION OF SERVICE.html">← TERMINATION OF SERVICE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.37_WHEN WILL I RETIRE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.38_REGAINING LOST POSITION AND RETIREMENT.html">REGAINING LOST POSITION AND RETIREMENT →</a></div></body>
