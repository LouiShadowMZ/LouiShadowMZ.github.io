liberally if Moon is in 7th Bhava. But I say that planet in the constellation
of Moon when Moon is in 7 or when it owns the 7th house, will give
opportunities to the person to donate liberally during the period and subperiod
of such planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, Mercury in the 10th house shows
that the person liberally gives gifts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun, Venus and Jupiter conjoined in any
house show that the person will offer gifts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">People born in Punarvasu give gifts beyond
their capacity. Moon in Gemini is favourable to offer gifts. Also people born
having their Lagna in Virgo Navamsa will be liberal in gifts.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.44_GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS_2"><span lang="EN-US">Mahadeva in Jataka Tatwa says that</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. If lord of 9 aspects Mercury in
exaltation in 11 or in a Kendra one gives liberally.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Lord of 9 in exaltation and also
aspected by a benefic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Lord of Lagna in a Kendra and lord of 9
in 1 or aspecting Lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Lord of 9 in Simhasanamsa aspected by
lords of 1 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Lord of 9 in good Varga, aspected by
Jupiter and lord of Lagna aspected by Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Lord of 9 in 4, lord of 10 in Kendra,
lord of 12, aspected by Jupiter gives rich presents (Donates landed property
gives away building).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. Lords of 1 and 2 in mutual
exchange-liberal in gifts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. Jupiter in the Navamsa sign occupied by
Atmakara.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9. Jupiter in 1 or 5 and Moon in 10.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.44_GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS_3"><span lang="EN-US">Kalidas</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">suggests that one is to judge gifts from
7th house. Saturn indicates receipts of gifts; but 5th house indicates feeding
others; gift for people affected by natural catastrophe.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.44_GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS_4"><span lang="EN-US">Vaidyanatha in Jataka Parijata says</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Jupiter in the second house, or</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Moon in 9 or</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. If in one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
horoscope, 5 planets occupy their own sign, or</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. If one is born during cool season,
winter, giving or accepting.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.44_GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS_5"><span lang="EN-US">Accepting Gifts</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. If the planet signifying the 10th house
matters were to be in Navamsa either in Sagittarius or Pisces, one has his
living by accepting gifts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Lord of Lagna strong in 11 and aspected
by lords of 9 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Lord of 5 in 9, lord of 9 in 10 and
aspected by lord of Lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Lord of 9 in a Kendra or Kona and
aspected by lord of 10.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.44_GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS_6"><span lang="EN-US">Gifts according to Westerners</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Are to be judged from the 8th house.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.44_GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS_7"><span lang="EN-US">According to me</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Receipts are judged from the houses, 2, 3,
6 and 11: giving away is to be judged from the houses 8, 9, 12 and 5.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second house indicates increase in bank
position. Third house shows Sahaya (assistance, help etc.) from others
(represented by 7th house). Sixth house denotes parting away by the person who
gives and 11th house is the gains.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7th house shows one who receives or one who
gives i.e. a transaction done with another: the person with whom one transacts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore houses 2, 3, 6 and 11 counted
from the 7th indicate the benefit to the other, i.e. giving the gift to
another. Therefore houses 8, 9, 12 and 5 indicate giving the gift.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rule is ever universal to find out the
significators:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) The strongest significator is that
planet which is situated in the constellation of the occupants of the houses 2,
3, 6 or 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) If none, the occupants of these houses.
Their strength is less than those in their constellations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) The planets in the constellation of the
lords of these houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) The lords of these houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) Planets conjoined with or aspected by
them. All these give opportunities to give gifts. The strength is to be judged
in the above manner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, planets connected with houses 8,
9, 12 and 5 indicate the gift one gives.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.43_CHOICE OF FRIENDS _FRIEND OR FOE.html">← CHOICE OF FRIENDS _FRIEND OR FOE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.44_GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.45_IMPRISONMENT.html">IMPRISONMENT →</a></div></body>
