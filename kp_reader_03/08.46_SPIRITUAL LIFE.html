<body><h2 id="heading_08.46_SPIRITUAL LIFE_0"><span lang="EN-US">SPIRITUAL LIFE</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Spiritual life brings about an attachment
to the unknown and unseen but about which we have read or heard much. Also it
brings about slowly and steadily or surprisingly and suddenly separation from
the family or detachment towards the material worldly pleasures.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mostly, all of us get initiated by a person</span>—<span lang="EN-US">a Guruji</span>—<span lang="EN-US">who has been experienced in those
lines, who had the dynamic urge within him to seek the Truth by penance and
deep meditation, regularly, systematically, continuously for a pretty long
period. Only a few solitary individuals have the urge from the birth and even
without a Guruji, they attain a high status in the spiritual life. They will be
a very few in many, many millions of the people, who will have Mukti or
progressive emancipation. Of them, a few will merge themselves with Nirguna
Braman.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For such an attainment, one has to
cultivate serenity, sincerity and simplicity. No university degree, nor any
diploma can give this. But these are to be either inborn or obtained by
cultivating these virtues. Also you should avoid audacity, irritability,
cruelty and impurity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One should keep the body fit, hale and
healthy by regular habits and practice. One can enjoy fullness, peace and bliss
only through meditation by trying to attain God-realisation developing a
detached attachment feeling towards wife, etc. It does not mean that one should
ignore her or forget her or get separated from her. The noblest way of enjoying
bliss by developing spiritual side is (as is said in Tamil 'Illaramay
Nallaram') to give due respect and regard to one's wife considering her as
Goddess Lakshmi, as the embodiment of patience, sacrifice, service and love, as
one who contributes for the building up of the nation by moulding the children,
as one who assists in our attempts. So one can lead a family life and at the
same time go on progressing on the spiritual side.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There are a very few people who desert the
family, run away and wait for the choultry bell for their daily meal </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Wretched! What a Sanyasi he is!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Nowadays criminals after committing the
crime try to hide themselves and hence lead a Sanyasin life without allowing
any one to know his whereabouts. Saffron dress alone does not make one a
Sanyasin. Development of the spiritual side by regular meditation and prayers
is needed. If one becomes a Sanyasi, in true sense, he is not denied of
absolute necessities. He will be respected and honoured. In that situation, if
need be, without a pie in the bank on his name he can operate on the purses and
cheques of the rich people, without a car, he can travel in latest modern car,
without a house of his own, he can be in a palace, though he does not pray for
it, but it comes automatically.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence lead a family life and at the same
time reduce Ika-Lokha-Sukha and improve the Para-Lokha-Sadhana.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(Therefore one has to judge a horoscope for
the above virtues and vices). Let us take an example.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Can this native achieve his aim in
spiritual side? The horoscope is as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="487" src="img/image078.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun Dasa balance 2 years 9 months 11 days.
Now he is running Jupiter Dasa Ketu Bhukti from 1-12-68.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Will he be sincere?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Benefic in the 4</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house,
in the constellation of another benefic and sub of a benefic makes one true,
reliable and sincere. In this chart Jupiter is in the 4</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> Bhava.
It is in Mercury's star and Jupiter sub. So he cannot afford to entertain evil
thoughts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Westerners claim that Saturn helps
concentration. According to their theory Saturn forms sextile aspect with the
ascendant and it promises that he will be able to concentrate. But according to
Krishnamurti, mind which is normally ever wavering is never at rest </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Hence, one is to find out the sub lord of the position occupied by
Moon. Moon is in 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US">48</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in
Taurus. Hence Moon is in the sub of Saturn. So any one having Moon in the sub
of Saturn can concentrate. This native also will meditate and concentrate. It is
possible.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.46_SPIRITUAL LIFE_1"><span lang="EN-US">Will he be arrogant</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One can be arrogant only when Mars is
connected with the ascendant, or at least with the lord of the ascendant. As
Mars has no connection at all, he will neither be arrogant, nor have the
egoism. If Mars is in Saturn sub, one will be unassuming and simple. Here Mars
is in sat sub. So, he will not have the vices which are to be avoided.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, when one has no vice, but has the
necessary virtues, then we have to judge whether one will have the opportunity
to have a good Guruji to initiate; if so, when.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house denotes initiation.
It is occupied by Mars. No planet is in Mars star. 5</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house is
owned by Jupiter. Sun alone is in Jupiter's star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore he will have initiation during
Jupiter Dasa, Sun Bukti Mars Anthra i.e., in September 1972.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.46_SPIRITUAL LIFE_2"><span lang="EN-US">Will he practise</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whenever Saturn is in 3, there will be
interruption. Yet it is the tenth house which shows one's Yoga, Karma, Yagna,
etc. No planet is in the 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house. Venus is the lord of the 10</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> cusp. It
is in Ketu star Saturn sub. Therefore he will practise.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.46_SPIRITUAL LIFE_3"><span lang="EN-US">Will there be progress</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Progress depends on the 11</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house. It is not occupied by any planet. Mercury is the lord of the
11</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> cusp. Jupiter alone in Mercury star. Therefore during Jupiter Dasa
itself, he will have satisfactory progress. Saturn Dasa follows. Saturn is in
Jupiter's sub. Hence it will continue </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Progress during
Saturn Dasa will be like an inclined plane ever increasing in height.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Westerners, Jupiter forming
trine aspect with Neptune in the 12</span><span lang="EN-US">th</span><span lang="EN-US"> house is very favourable
for the awakening of spiritual faculties. The inspirational nature will be
marked. This aspect is good for material success, worldly pleasures and vast advancement
in spiritual life.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.45_IMPRISONMENT.html">← IMPRISONMENT</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.46_SPIRITUAL LIFE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.47_ABOUT DRESS.html">ABOUT DRESS →</a></div></body>
