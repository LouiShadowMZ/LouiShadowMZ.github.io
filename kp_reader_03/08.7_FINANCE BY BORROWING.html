has to spend more than what he has on hand as also his income. Therefore, to
know why and when debt is incurred, the horoscopes are to be examined to
ascertain how money is earned or received and the cause of one's necessity to
spend as well as the extent to which he is to meet the expenses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second house indicates one's bank position.
cash on hand and readily cashable, movable property. Tenth house shows one's
profession and inheritance. Eleventh house is the balance sheet indicating
one's net profit. One may earn money through the sources indicated by houses 1
to 10 (i.e., 1st house, by his exertion; 2nd self - acquisition; 3rd through
brother, short journey, touring, agency, editing; 4th education or transport
department or through mother; 5th through speculation, cinema, music, children;
6th by serving others; 7th by business and through partners; 8th by insurance,
legacy; 9th long journey, connection with foreigners; 10th through his own
profession, business or ancestral property.) The house 12 indicates the
expenses. Hence the benefits from houses 1 to 10 are added together and the
loss from house 12 is deducted; the net balance is called the profit which is
shown by the 11th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally, houses 2, 10 and 11 are studied
to understand how one makes money: 6th house denotes why, when, and the extent
to which one borrows; 8th house indicates either loss and misery or unexpected
gains; or clearing off loan or lending money; 12th house indicates one's
expenses, investments, repayment of loan or lending money, etc. Therefore, a
careful consideration of the houses 6, 8 and 12 will indicate one's
commitments, expenses, loss and the necessity to borrow.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Ascendant indicates the person who
borrows. The 7th house from his Lagna denotes the gentleman or the lady or the
banker who advances the loan.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sixth house denotes debts. What is a loan?
It is an income to the person. His bank position improves by borrowing. To the
person lending money, the sixth house is the twelfth (7th being his ascendant).
i.e., it is a deterioration in his bank position to the extent to which he
advances the loan. Therefore, debt is, the receipt of money by the person who
borrows and expenses to one who lends.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As parting with money for expenses may be
to discharge one's debts, 12th house of a person shows clearing off loans or
part payment towards the debts already incurred. Is not the 12th house, the
sixth from the 7th? Hence, to the native who borrows from this person or who
receives back the loan; already lent, the 12th house indicates the receipt to
the man with whom the transaction is done and who is indicated by the 7th
house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the 6th house indicates raising of
loan (receipt of money and the 12th house denotes repayment of loan or
expenses. Kalidasa a in Uthra - Kalamritha has said that 12th house is to be
judged for clearing off loans.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What about the 8th house?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 8th house is the second to the 7th.
Second house shows one's finance, whereas 7th house denotes one with whom a
transaction is done. Suppose there is an evil planet in the 8th house of a
person: it means that the evil is in the second house to one who transacts. It
threatens that the person with whom the money transaction is done, will lose
money and there will be difficulty.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But, if a benefic is in the 8th house, it
promises the regaining of money with pleasure. "Somyae Ranthrae
Dhanapthi" says Mahadeva. Everybody in this world will try to maintain
prestige. None would wish to borrow unless circumstances force him to do so. If
one has borrowed, he would desire to return it much earlier than the time
required by him to repay.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sublord of 8th cusp is the
significator of houses 5, 6, 8 and 12 difficulties come as a battalion and he
has to face them by borrowing from his friends A to Z.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if the sublord of the 8th Cusp is the
Significator of 2, 10 or 11th houses and if its period or sub - period runs,
with pleasure, he returns the money.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The tenth house shows one's profession,
receipt of money, etc. Tenth house to the 7th opponent or lender is the fourth
house to the native. Therefore, 4th house also indicates return of money, by
the person, and the discharge of debts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The eleventh house shows profit. The
principal and the interest are indicated by the 11th house in the native's
chart if he has lent money. But if he has borrowed, the 11th to the 7th shows
the return of the amount. Therefore 5th house indicates discharge of debts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore receipt of money is indicated by
the houses 2, 6, 10 and 11 whereas the discharge of debts can be read from the
houses 4, 5, 8 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If beneficial planets occupy, own or aspect
favourably the houses 2, 10 and 11, one will make money in their periods and
sub periods, in their star days and week days. So also, benefics occupying the
houses 4, 5, 8 or 12 or owning or aspecting these houses, or planets in the
constellation of the occupants and owners of these houses indicate the
discharge of the loan in their dasa, bhukti and anthara, in their week days and
star days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Planets in 2, 10 and 11 and in the Sub of
Significators of 4, 5, 8 or 12 reduce one's income and there will be difficulty
to make money. Similarly planets in 4, 5, 8 and 12 will increase the expenses
if the sublord is the significator of 4, 5, 8 or 12 and they will not allow one
to discharge the loan. But in their dasas and bhukties the native will suffer
mental agony, anxiety, pressure, worry, depression, irritation, illrepute,
humiliation etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is the scientific explanation for a
few houses being considered for the raising of funds and the rest for
repayment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now, let us find out why one has to borrow
and when.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When the sublord of 6 is also the
Significator of 12 and associated with the houses 6, 8 or 12 the debt is
incurred due to (1) one's ill - health or the expenses of his or her partner
(12th to 7th), ill - health of partner (6th to 7th), unexpected loss, (8th and
12th) investment, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By association, is meant that, (a) the
house may be occupied by or aspected by a planet or (b) the lord of the house
may occupy the houses 6, 8 or 12 or be conjoined with them or aspected by them.
The following is the chart of a person who is ever in debts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Lagna is occupied by Saturn, the lord
of 8. It is in the constellation of the lords of 6 (Punarvasu star ruled by
Jupiter). The lord of Lagna is in the constellation of Jupiter, the lord of 6.
It is occupying the 8th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury, the lord of 12, aspects the
Ascendant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So ascendant is occupied by the lord of 8
and aspected by the lord of 12. The lord of the lagna is 8 in the constellation
of the lord of 6. Here, the lord of Lagna is associated with the lord of 6.
Lagna is associated with the lords of 8 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="551" src="img/image022.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) When the lord of the second house is
also the Significator of 6th, 8th or 12th house debt is caused by (a) expenses
in the family, (b) medical bill for eye or throat treatment of the person, or
(c) danger to partner, (d) or due to the loss of an younger brother, or (e)
payment to mother or (f) to one's children at the time of their appointment or
promotion or (g) as loan to father either for his business or to meet his loss.
There will not be much difficulty to raise the loan. It may be hand loan or one
kept in the suspense account.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) When the sublord of the cusp of 3rd
house, or its lord is also the Significators of 6 or 12 the debt may be
incurred due to the native's brother; if posited in male sign, and to sister if
posited in female sign. The lord of 3 in a male sign and Mars in a female sign
indicate expenses through both brother and sister. It may be raised to help a
neighbour; or one may stand surety for another; or may borrow money to make
short journeys, purchase a printing press or take up any agency or contract.
Some may pledge shares, certificates and documents or ear rings, necklace,
bangles, rings etc., to raise the loan if the 3rd house is connected with 6th
house. If however houses 8 and 12 are associated, the sale of these jewels is
indicated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Should the significator of 4 and Moon
be associated with house 6, 8 or 12 the debt may be raised either through
mother or for purchase of cattle or animals. If the significator of 4 and Mars
are associated with 6, 8 or 12, one may borrow for the purchase of land,
buildings, etc. Even raising a loan by pledging a house or land is indicated by
the significator of 4 connected with the 6th house. The lord of 4 connected
with the houses 3, 8 or 12 indicate generally the disposal of the Property.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the lord of 6 has no connection with any
benefic, but occupies the 9th house then, during the period of the lord of 4,
the property may be brought to auction, sold or appropriated by the opponent.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) If the significator of 5 and Jupiter
are connected with houses 6, 8 or 12, debts are caused on account of children
(their education or danger to their lives). Or one may borrow due to the loss
in speculation, cinema or any other risky enterprises or love affairs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(6) If the significator of 6 is associated
with Saturn, debt is caused due to the persistent inimical activity of the
opponents, or due to loss by theft, and disease, Jupiter connected with them
indicates that the necessity for borrowing is due to litigation. Jupiter, Mars
and Sun connected with them indicate debts due to election.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the significator of 7 and the lords of 2
and 10 are connected with houses 6, 8 or 12 debt is due to the partner in
business. But if Venus and the significator of 7 are associated with 6, 8 or 12
the debt is caused through one's wife. If Jupiter and Significator of 7 are
connected with 6, 8 or 12, litigation may need a large sum of money or one may
borrow to meet the expenses of the second son. Waist belts made of gold etc.
may be pledged.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(8) Should the Significator of 8 be
associated with the houses 1, 8 or 12, and if a malefic also aspects, debts are
caused due to enemies, danger, disease, difficulties, disharmony, dispute etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(9) If the 9th house or the Significator of
9 is connected with the lords of 6, 8 or 12 or the houses 6, 8 or 12 then the
necessity to borrow may be due to father, or wife's younger brother or sister
(there are people who incur debt to celebrate sister-in-law's marriage), or due
to his partner's journey, or through the third child or the native going on a
long journey or overseas or for higher studies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(10) If the Significator of 10 and Sun are
associated with the houses 6, 8 or 12 one may have to borrow to repay the debts
left behind by father or due to business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(11) If the Significator of 11 is
associated with the houses 8 or 12 the debts may be due to the native's
standing surety to a friend.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the Significator of 11 and Mars are
associated together with the houses 8 or 12 one may incur debts due to an elder
brother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="566" src="img/image023.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu dasa Balance 9 years, 5 months and 18
days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When this native was running Saturn Dasa,
Mars Bhukti, Jupiter Anthra he stood surety to his elder brother born in
Anuradha star. Unfortunately in the beginning of December 1953, his elder
brother, within a month, after the transaction passed away and the native had
to return the loan through his nose.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the lord of 11 and Sun are associated
with the houses 8 or 12, one incurs debt due to his father's younger brother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the lord of 11, Jupiter and Venus are
connected with the houses 8 or 12, one incurs debt due to son-in-law.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(12) Lord of 12 and Saturn generally cause
loss by theft, fraud, deception, etc. and also due to the action of the secret
enemies. People having Saturn in 12 and Mars or Ketbu in 2, should be very
careful; they should not leak out any of their secret, unlawful action, in an
unguarded moment to men in power, e.g. police, Income-tax official, etc. When
they run the conjoined period of Saturn in 12, and Mars or Ketbu in 2, they
will be taken to task. Even if Saturn is in 3, 6, or 10 it can throw aspect to the
12th house and bring about the sudden fall to the person. That is why, sages
are of strong opinion that Saturn in the 10th house gives sudden rise in one's
career only for a big pitfall, later.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also, lord of the 12th house may be the
cause for borrowing money to celebrate the marriage of servants.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">WHEN? So far, why one has to borrow was
discussed. Now it should be understood that the planets indicating the
necessity to borrow will give the results in their dasas and bhukties and also
the day, the Star on that day, the Lagna, Rasi and the constellation which will
be ruled by them. (The significators will form favourable aspect with their
original position at the time of birth).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">How many persons there are who, even after
borrowing need more money and suffer just like a person who having married a
girl who has not attained age continues to be mostly a bachelor. Such persons,
even in want, are born in the yoga termed as </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Dharidhra
yoga</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> i.e. the relative disposition of planets causing
poverty. For them, it will be difficult even to raise funds. They have to make
many attempts and at the time they receive money they get vexed and dejected as
the amount received will not be sufficient. It will disappear in no time. It
will be spent away. Such yogas are mentioned below: (Hindu).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="545" src="img/image024.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. If the lord of lagna is connected with
the lord of 7 and if the lords of 1 and 12 are in mutual exchange.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. When the lords of 1 and 6 exchange
places and Moon is aspected by the lords of the 2nd and 7th houses;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Lord of Lagna in the eighth house is
associated with the lord of 2 or 7.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. The Lord of Lagna in 8 is associated
with the lords 2 and 7 and a malefic;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. The lord of 5 in 6, 8 or 12, devoid of
connection with a benefic;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. The lord of 5 in 6 or 10, aspected by
the lord of 2, 6, 7 or 8 and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. Natural malefics (without being the
lords of 9th and 10th houses) occupy Lagna associated by lords of 2 or 7.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="538" src="img/image025.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dharidhra yoga means that one will continue
to borrow for ever. He will have a list of those who can lend money. 5th house
denotes the thought of a person. Moon indicates mind. If Moon is in 5 and is
conjoined with Ketbu, one will be ever planning how to raise a loan, whom to
approach, etc., will somehow manage to borrow only to find that his position
has not improved. This is especially true in those cases where there is no
planet in 2 or 12 to Moon, and no benefic in 4, 7 or 10 when counted from the Moon
sign.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.7_FINANCE BY BORROWING_1"><span lang="EN-US">HINDU</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Debt is also caused by the mere occupation
of a rasi by certain planets and a few other connections:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Mars in Pisces with Sun, Moon and
Saturn;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Mercury occupying either of the houses
owned by Saturn;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Mercury in Taurus shows debts through
relations;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Mars and Saturn in 12 denote debts
through brothers and sisters;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Jupiter in 12 associated with a malefic
shows that one will borrow to pay taxes;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Sun and Moon in 12 or Sun, Rahu and
Venus in 12 show debt due to litigation;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. Pisces, Leo or Sagittarius being the
ascendant with Moon in Aquarius or Venus in Scorpio or Jupiter in the 8th
house, indicate loan raised for donation, charity, endowment etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">People, who advance loans, and also borrow
money due to any of the above-mentioned causes, will have the following
combinations:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Find out the house occupied by the lord
of Lagna. Note in which Navamsa sign he was at the time of birth. Find out the
lord of the Navamsa sign occupied by the lord of Lagna. If the lord of the
Navamsa sign occupies friend's quarters and receives aspect from Jupiter, he
will lend money.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Find out the lords of the navamsa signs
occupied by the lords of 2 and 11. If in the rasi Kundali, birth chart, the
lords of the Navamsa signs occupy a Kendra Sthana (1, 4, 7 or 10 counted from
the ascendant) he will advance the loan.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you find the following Yogas in the
horoscope of those who want you to lend money to them, be sure that you cannot
have it repaid as they can never discharge the loan before they retire from
service or from the world itself:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) If, in the borrower's horoscope, the
lord of 2 is debilitated or eclipsed or posited at the end of a rasi governed
by a malefic;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) or if the lord of 2 is in 6 or 12, with
the lord of 12 in 2 and the lord of 11 in any one of the three Dush Sthanas 6,
8 or 12;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) or the lord of Lagna in 12, malefic in
2 and the lord of 10 is associated with the lord of 11. These combinations are
found in the horoscopes of a few members of the co-operative societies who will
ever borrow to the maximum eligibility by way of</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Permanent loans,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Emergency loan,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Thrift fund loan,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Provident Fund</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) Insurance loan,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) Hand loan,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) By pledging movable property and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(h) By mortgaging immovable properties.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Can one discharge the loan and be free from
worry?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Find out when he will borrow; i.e., the
yogas causing the need to raise a loan, the Dasa and Bhukti of those Planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Find out whether he will live long
after borrowing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Find out whether there will be time
enough for the periods and sub periods of the planets promising the opportunity
to wash off loans, after the yoga to borrow is over.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Debt can be realised when one runs the
beneficial periods of the planets occupying or owning the houses 2, 6, 10 and
11 and when one who borrowed money, runs the period of the Significators of 2,
6, 10 or 11 counted from his 7th house. They are 8, 12, 4 and 5 counted from
the lagna of the borrower's horoscope. Benefits occupying the houses 4, 5, 8
and 12 indicates that during their periods one will clear off the debts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If one is not able to return, will he be
put into trouble? Will he lose his prestige and reputation? Or will he be drawn
to Civil Court and even to get imprisoned?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Loss of reputation, imprisonment, etc. are
threatened by the malefics posited in 2, 5, 9 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Scorpio happens to be the 5th, 9th or
12th house and Saturn be posited therein, not only will he be unable to repay,
but also he may be manhandled and drawn to the court of law. His reputation
will be at stake. Kalachakra dasa of the lord of the 6th house indicates
similar undesirable results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even though a person may be born a King or
a Kubera, if his lord of Lagna is eclipsed, in enemy's camp, debilitated and is
in 6th, 8th or 12th house associated with the lords of 2 and 7, without any
association with a benefic, he must borrow. Similarly, a person born to a
multimillionaire will borrow, if Sun and Saturn occupy the second house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Where to go to raise a loan, will be the
problem. The direction in which one can go for borrowing money is indicated by
(a) the rasi in which the lord of the second house is posited, (b) or by the
direction of the rasi occupied by lord of 11 and (c) by the lord whose Bhukti
operates.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the above lords are in direct motion,
attempts made in the direction mentioned, will be helpful. If however, the
lords be retrograde one can make attempts in all directions and there will be
grand success in all quarters. Suppose one is born in the sign Leo as
ascendant, then the lord of 2 and 11 happens to be Mercury. When one runs
Mercury sub period and it was in direct motion at the time of birth, one can
meet a banker in the north as Mercury indicates north direction and he will be
successful only there. Even if Mercury is in the 10th house, one should try in
the north. If Mercury was retrograde at the time of birth, he can try anywhere.
He is sure to come out successful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One should also consider the house (bhava)
in which the lord of 1, 2 and the Bhuktinatha was. If they were in the 3rd
house, he may have it from his brother or neighbour and also by executing a
bond. If they were in the 4th house, his close relative or one in the same
locality will lend. If in the 9th house, the banker may be a stranger or one
who lives far away. If in the 11th house, elder brother or sister or a friend
or father's younger brother may help. If in the 10th house, either in the
office or from the officer he borrow. Or one may pledge Government bonds if
Mercury is in 10. If they are in the 6th house, one may take money from his
subordinates as loan.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The planet in the 6th house shows that one
may raise a loan by pledging any of his possessions. One should judge the
houses 4, 10 and 11 to redeem them: but houses 8 and 12 denote that the pledged
property will be disposed of ultimately.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here is the sincere advice to clear off
one's loans easily, with pleasure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Borrow an amount which is a little greater
than the need; if you want Rs. 10,000 borrow Rs. 12,000.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Keep separately Rs. 2,000 - the excess.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Wait for the day when the star is either
Aswini or Anuradha.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Select the Lagna - Aries if it is Aswini
Star day or the Lagna - Scorpio, if it is Anuradha.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time, repay these 2,000 rupees as a
part - payment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This guarantees, that you will be fortunate
and repay the full amount in a very short period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Or, you select either a Tuesday or a
Saturday or a Sunday. On that day, the thithi should be either Chathurthi or
Chathurdasi. Work out and ascertain in which sign Gulika will be on that day.
If possible, calculate the correct time and repay a part of the loan at that
time, so that Gulikha is exactly in Lagna. You will be surprised to see, that
you are able to clear the full loan in a very short period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Or select a Saturday and let the ascendant
be in a movable sign, either Aries, Cancer, Libra or Capricorn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is always advisable to have a malefic in
