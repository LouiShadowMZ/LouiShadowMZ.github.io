<body><h2 id="heading_08.19_ON BLINDNESS_0"><span lang="EN-US">ON BLINDNESS</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The planets which are said to give vision
or cause blindness are Moon, Sun and Venus. Sun and Moon throw light and remove
darkness. As regards Venus, in Hindu Mythology it is said that Venus is the
Priest or the Preceptor of the Demons. It is presumed to be without one eye, as
it is said that one eye was affected by Lord Vishnu when he took the Avathar of
"Vamana". Hence if one is to be blind, one should run the period of
Sun or Moon or Venus or those deposited in their constellations or any planet
deposited in the constellation of the occupant or owner of second house and sub
of the significator of 12th house who is connected with Sun or Moon or Venus.
This is Krishnamurti Padhdhati.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But according to traditional astrology
there are various rules and let me quote a few of the many. After reading, you
will find them to be very general; we should be blind and deaf according to
these rules.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. If lord of Lagna is conjoined with Sun
and Venus and if they occupy any of the three evil houses 6 or 8 or 12 one will
be blind from birth itself.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. If the two evils, Saturn and Mars, are
in 5 or 9 and Rahu is in the Lagna along with eclipsed Sun, one will be blind
from birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. If lords of 1 and 2 are in 6 or 8 or 12
and are conjoined with Sun and Venus, one will be born blind. (Persons born
during 8 planets configuration at night between 7 and 9 P.M. in Leo Lagna are
not blind).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. If Moon and Mars cause Chandramangala
yoga in 6 or 8 or 12, one become blind, due to fall.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Similarly, Moon and Jupiter conjoined
(causing Gajakesari yoga) be in 6 or 8 or 12, one becomes blind due to sexual
excesses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. If Sun and Moon are conjoined in 1, 3,
4, 7 or 10, one becomes blind. That is, one will use spectacles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. If Mars occupies the sign belonging to
an evil planet which is the first or fourth or seventh or tenth house, one is
blind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. If one is born in Cancer or Leo and Sun
is in the 7th one becomes blind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9. If lords of 1, 2 and 12 conjpin Venus
and all of them are together in 6 or 8 or 12, one becomes blind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10. If there is an evil planet in the
second house conjoined with Venus and Moon, one is blind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11. Malefics in houses 4 and 5 make a
person blind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12. Moon in 6 or 8 or 12 receiving aspect
from a malefic causes blindness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">13. Sun and Moon in 12 not aspected by
benefics, cause loss of vision.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">14. If one is born in Leo Lagna and Saturn
or Venus occupy the Lagna, one suffers from blindness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">15. Saturn in 12, Moon in 2, and Sun in 8
causes loss of vision.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">16. Moon in 6, Sun in 8, Mars in 12, and
Saturn in 2 deprives one of his eyesight.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">17. Saturn in the fourth house and
receiving aspect from another malefic, causes loss of sight.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">18. Rahu in 5 to Venus or to Lagna and is
aspected by Sun makes one blind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">19. Moon and Venus in 6 or 8 or 12 causes
night blindness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">20. Moon, Venus and lord of 2 in the Lagna
cause night blindness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">21. Lords of 1 and 2 in 6 or 8 or 12
indicate loss of eyes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">22. Mars in 12 affects left eye, whereas
Saturn in 2 affects the right eye.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">23. If the lagna is occupied by lords of 2,
6 and 10 with Venus, due to the orders of the Government, one will lose his eye
(Not applicable, nowadays, thank God!)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="558" src="img/image041.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus there are many more rules. Traditional
Astrologers must cram these general rules and should remember all these
doubtful rules at the time of application to read the result. One should not
forget that there is a limit to which such rules can be committed to memory,
apart from the utility of such rules in the present day conditions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us see how far the above rules apply.
Also how K.P. explains.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The horoscope of a young child whose
birthday came a few days ago is given above. The child is blind from the birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn Dasa balance at the time of birth
was 5 years, 11 months, 16 days. Mars Bhukti was operating at the time of birth
and Moon during Epoch.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.19_ON BLINDNESS_1"><span lang="EN-US">Traditional Method</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to the Hindu method no evil
planet is in 2 or 12, (Kethu is in Lagna Bhava). Only Jupiter is in 12
according to the traditional method. 11th house which is considered to be one
which will invariably offer desirable results is tenanted by Sun, Mercury and
Venus. Nowhere it is said that these planets in 11 will cause blindness.
According to tradition, Saturn comes to the 7th Bhava. None of the 23 rules
given above finds a place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What do the Westerners say? Let us see what
Sepharial and Carter have mentioned in their books. "The Manual of
Astrology" and "Encyclopaedia of Psychological Astrology"
respectively. Sepharial (Page 78 </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Physical
Peculiarities ) says as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"The eyes: The Moon being with the
Pleiades (in Taurus 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US">) or in ASSELLI (Leo 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> or with Antaras (In Sagittarius 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US">) or the
Sun in these three places afflicted by Mars from an angle, the person born may
become blind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The same result follows from the Moon in
opposition to the Sun, or the Moon in conjunction with the Sun, in any of these
nebulous parts of the zodiac. When either the Sun or Moon is in or near Taurus
29</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Leo 6</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> or Sagittarius 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and afflicted by any planet, defective eye sight is the result, the
cause differing according to afflicting planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Sun in Aquarius, afflicted by Saturn,
especially by the opposition or conjunction, stone blindness frequently
results. The sign Aquarius corresponds to the etheric vibrations, and therefore
has affinity with the sense of sight.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Sun and Moon being in opposition from
Aries and Libra give weak sight, and sometimes sore eyes. The same if the Sun
or Moon be in Aries and afflicted by Mars or Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Pluto rising, squared by the Sun and Moon
will also cause weak sight and accentuate liability to blindness, more
especially if the signs Taurus, Leo or Aquarius are involved.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a malefic planet occupies any of the
nebulous parts of the Zodiac already referred to, and afflict the Sun or Moon
by aspect then danger of blindness will arise from an accident, more
particularly if the malefic be elevated above the luminary.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this matter it is better to have the
Moon afflicted than the Sun, for it gives greater hope of relief.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sight (Eye), (Carter) Visual defects are
said to occur when the luminaries are afflicted in or from the nebulous parts
of the zodiac. It need hardly be said that the analogical connection between
nebula and clouded sight upon which this tradition be based, must not be taken
as the only foundation of the thesis, which is well supported by the facts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following parts of the zodiac
especially have this effect:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Gemini </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Sagittarius (Aldebaran and Antares).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Leo </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Aquarius (the Aselli)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Cancer </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Capricorn</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">29</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Taurus </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> Scorpio (the Pleiades).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It will be noted that not all of these are
coincident with notable nebulae.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Affliction in the centre of mutable signs
is very common. Strong bad aspects involving these areas and the luminaries,
especially if in angles, are very liable to cause serious trouble.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As ascending signs, Gemini, Aquarius and
Capricorn probably most often have defective sight. Gemini has often very quick
and keen vision, but there is generally some defect of focus, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The luminaries in strong mutual affliction
nearly always cause unequal sight with the two eyes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Numerous examples are given in various
text-books.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It should be borne in mind that Mercury has
much to do with the entire nervous system, of which the eyes are the most
developed and exposed part, and afflictions to this planet often cause myopia.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Squinting is usually indicated by Mercury
afflicted Mars or Uranus, and perhaps by Neptune with a Mars sign is involved.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cataract: It would seem that the horoscope
features mentioned under sight will usually appear more or less prominently and
an affliction of Mercury from Neptune is common. This is for cataract.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.19_ON BLINDNESS_2"><span lang="EN-US">K.P</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second house shows right eye; 12th house
indicates left eye. Disease is indicated by the sixth house; 8th the danger,
12th the defect.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As per Krishnamurti Padhdhati Ketu is in 12
in the above example chart. Any planet in the constellation of Ketu shows the
defect, and depending on the nature of the planet and the houses signified by
it, the nature of the defect is to be ascertained. Saturn is in Aswini; Mercury
and Venus are in Makam, in Ketu star. Therefore these three planets denote
defect only when the 12th cusp sub lord denotes disease or defect.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 12th cusp is in Sun's star, Moon sub.
Moon is in 6th house as per K.P. But tradition says that Moon is in 7. Hence
one can expect disease or defect. As nodes offer the result of the planet by
which they are aspected, Ketu has to give the results of Moon also as Moon
aspects Ketu. Further, Ketu is in Moon's constellation. As Moon and Sun are the
luminaries giving light to us, and when Moon is spoiled by being the sub-lord
of the 12th cusp and is in 6, vision is affected. The epoch of the child was during
Saturn Dasa Moon sub period. As Saturn by nature is a planet for deficiency and
Moon is for vision, the child has no perfection in the development of the
ocular system during intra-uterine life. Therefore if the sub-lord of the 12th
cusp is in 6, the house of disease, and if the sub-lord is in the constellation
of the planet occupying or owning 6 or 8 or 12 it is definite that one will
have the defect from the time when the significators conjointly operate. If
Saturn Dasa Moon Bhukti is to operate at some age, then the child will become
blind then.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Any Cure: The dasa that are to run are
Saturn, Mercury, Ketu and Venus. Ketu is in 12 in the constellation of Moon in
6. Saturn, Mercury and Venus are in Ketu star. Hence cure is out of question.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Longevity of the child: Saturn Dasa,
Jupiter Bhukti, Venus Anthra, Mercury Shookshma is anxious, i.e. around August
1973.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.18_DISEASE.html">← DISEASE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.19_ON BLINDNESS">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.20_HEALTH AND HEART.html">HEALTH AND HEART →</a></div></body>
