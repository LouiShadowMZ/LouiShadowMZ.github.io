<body><h2 id="heading_08.49_ROAD TO SUCCESS_0"><span lang="EN-US">ROAD TO SUCCESS</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We want peace and pleasure; progress and
prosperity. How can we have them?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All of us have some weakness or fault or
defect in us. Never mind what they are; never worry about them; waste no time
in learning them and correcting ourselves. Can anybody have sound sleep having
bug in the bed and lice in the head? Do not we try to eradicate them? Similarly
we should take all measures to correct ourselves and cultivate desirable
habits. Otherwise look, how they appear in others.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Find out one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
weakness and what he should do. The sign occupied by the lord of the
constellation in which the sublord of the Ascendant is situated will give the
clue. That is, you note who is the lord of the sub in which the lagna falls. As
a planet offers the result of the lord of the constellation in which it is
deposited, note in which constellation the sub lord of the Ascendant is
tenanted. Then find out in which sign the lord of the constellation is. The
characteristic of that sign is to be understood and, noting down the
weaknesses, one should improve. The argument is that when twins are born within
10 minutes difference and the lagna is in the same sign and in the same star,
which is it that changes, except the sub in that star. This method is really
surprising, correct and useful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. If the sub-lord of your Ascendant is in
the constellation of a planet in ARIES:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You would change your views quite suddenly
without any consideration: at last you will realise that such a change has not
done any benefit to you. Hence consider every matter deeply, calmly and wisely.
You will not relish others</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> suggestion. But cultivate
to take the advice of the wise and experienced persons who proceed steadily in
all matters. You will be dogmatic in religious matters. You will be a fanatic
and an extremist. This will create many enemies and cause varieties of
troubles. Whenever you meet with opposition, you lose your temper, use your
militant nature and abuse others. You will sweep aside every obstacle that
confronts your way without scrutinising the means you employ to get rid of it.
So give up that fighting tendency and be considerate. Whenever there is
litigation about your land or building or the boundary, try to compromise. In
married life, do not widen the gap by repeatedly finding fault with your
partner for silly things and picking up quarrels. So, have a control over your
temper. Do not get elated when someone talks high of you. Consider why he talks
so and judge properly. Neither be extravagant nor impulsive. Suppose you do, as
you like, then you yourself will say that you had wasted a great deal of time,
energy and money. Do not you realise that hasty action takes you by wrong route
and the whole attempt was a waste? Hurriedly, only one thing which you can do,
is to catch flies, as the Russians say. So cultivate Patience; Perseverance
will follow. Prosperity will be the result. But if you never hear others, how
can you expect others to answer your call when you need it? That is why, in
politics, none can be a successful person for a long term. Always you should
have a long range policy. Follow the above advice. Will you do? Then you are
the Leader.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. If the sub-lord of your Ascendant is in
the constellation of a planet in TAURUS:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Your feelings will be extremely
concentrated and they will create many enemies </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> all
undesirable. Further hatred and jealousy will be the outcome. You are generally
stubborn, rigid and reserved. But there should be the occasions when you should
relax also. Always to be very stubborn will surely do you harm. People with
this position may be perverse also. It is not as bad as another, born being
very obstinate. You do not admit that you are a fatalist. But you are always
more or less a fatalist. Do not be very selfish. You are called selfish not for
pursuing your own good but for neglecting your neighbour. However virtuous you
may be, the virtues will not shine if you are selfish just as the sweet water
in the river loses its quality by emptying into the brackish sea water. It is
good that you do not lose your temper quickly. But it is very bad of you when
you are vindictive, revengeful as you retain it for a long period. Even after
some years have passed, you can</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t forget. The sign
TAURUS (Bull) represents this also, i.e., even after biting the grass once, it
brings back the cud and minces it again and reduces grass to nothing. Thus due
to your slow, steady and solid attack, you do much harm to your opponent. This
is too much. You should cultivate forgiving habit. Without any pain and strain
you want to do everything easily. You never work hard and are never
painstaking. So, you meet with failure. At least necessary activity is
essential. Heavens will never help you if you do not act. Be active, you will
be happy. Also do not be over cautious and exasperatingly deliberate. Do not be
fond of easiness and thereby develop laziness. Sloths will smother many
virtues. When you develop such a habit and lead such a life for some years
then, you will find when necessity for work arises, that you are unfit and
everything will appear to be difficult. So cultivate industry; everything will
become easy. So get up early; be active, cultivate to help others. Forget
others</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> faults and Forgive. You will be blessed with a
pleasant good life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. If the sub-lord of the ascendant is in
the constellation of the planet occupying GEMINI:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You will be prone to speedy and thorough
changes in your point of view. You are deplorably lacking in persistance and
also in taking a quick decision in any matter. You will consider the pros and
cons, merits and demerits for such a long time that you miss the bus. The
father of a Gemini boy suggested his son to select one of the three girls whom
he had contacted. Before the Geminian could take a decision, all the three
girls got married and when this boy wrote that he would prefer to marry one of
them, he was surprised to be informed by the other party "sorry, he was
too late". You do not have the deliberate determination to do any job and
stick to it till it is completed. But none can do things more easily,
gracefully and successfully than yourself. So also none can be a better adviser
than you. When such is the case why should you take undue time to take any
decision in your personal matters. The other great defect in you is that when
once you have started to do any work, you are very nasty and anxious to know
the results then and there. Suppose you have sown some seeds, you will
irrigate, nurture and do all that is needed. It is good. But your anxiety or
curiosity would be to dig the earth and note then and there, how far it has
progressed. As you are intelligent you always find out shortcuts to finish a
job. You cannot work in the same way as others do in their routine method. You
adopt improved methods to do it quickly. It is, no doubt, advantageous. But you
do not take rest; nor you take exercise. Your health fails due to restlessness.
So if you develop coherence, steadiness, quick decision and patience to hear
others without resenting their suggestions and give up irritability,
impatience, etc., then you will be the best intellectual to offer advice and to
successfully complete many projects, big or small.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. If the sub-lord of the ascendant is
deposited in the constellation of the planet situated in CANCER:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You have the tendency to imagine slights,
think over and over again about others failure in showing courtesy or respect
to you. So you have your feelings and get hurt easily. Ignore failures on
other's part. As you ponder over again and again before making any attempt you
miss many an opportunity like the Gemini occupants. Before you decide which
state Lottery ticket you can buy, that would have already been drawn. If you
will think and think and at last decide to buy a raincoat and the day you buy,
the season will end. Hence the delay has not served you any purpose; within
yourself, you will feel that your delayed action ended in a waste. You are
completely ruled by emotions and imagination. So it leads to a wandering and
restless life. Rolling stone never gathers mass. A stenographer applied for a
post. To prove his experience he had enclosed certificates received from the
departments where he had served previously. The number of the companies he had
served was much more than the number of years of his service, on the whole. You
may be moody. So you waste your time, energy and talent. You always think of
the future and worry about money matters. You become old prematurely because of
such anxiety from youth. Take insurance policy and open recurring deposit account
in a bank. Avoid anxiety. It is a pity that you are a constant prey to
sensationalism and exaggerated emotion. So for days, you shun your friends and
relatives and again emerge out as usual. You have good memory. You never forget
the past. You can tell how you lived in a very poverty-stricken condition in
youth and how you built up by steady savings, etc. Again you will never forget
any harm done to you by anybody; nor you have the mind to forgive. In the case
of SCORPIO occupants, they then and there retort and forget. But, Oh God! You
will be going on pinching like a wicked mother-in-law. Hence read this and
improve yourself. God will grant you FORTUNE.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. If the sub-lord of your Ascendant is in
the constellation of a planet in LEO:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Your thirst for personal glory is
unquenchable. Even though you are absolutely unfit to hold a very high
responsible position with authority, you are over-ambitious and it is
ridiculous. Can everybody expect to marry a Princess? You will attack your enemies
when unguarded and that too from behind. Even though such a tactics is good for
a Military Officer, it is not good in civil life. You should not pose yourself
like a lion and attack others. Cultivate to be modest and polite. Some authors
view that Lion is not a warrior but a fraud. You will show favouritism to some.
It means you deny the legitimate claim to the other. It is never honourable nor
agreeable. You do not consider both sides of the question. You do, as you
decide to do. Whenever you are crossed you become controvert. Just like SUN is
always in direct motion and never retrograde, so also you always go, on and on,
and never look back. You wrongly feel that those whom you had helped remain
ungrateful over liberal. So you will be ever in want. Cultivate to cut the coat
according to the cloth. You hate mean petty actions and you expect others also
to follow yours footsteps. Your type is ever in the minority in this world just
like the lions among all animals. You become bitter, suspicious and over critical
as you find that you had been deceived. Otherwise you are proud; you presume
much of self-importance and gradually become arrogant. Hence other reasonable
people view this with contempt. You are over-ambitious; you have your own fears
whether you would be over-looked; so, you forcibly make your presence felt. You
try to develop the mind to love one and all, universally and judge things
impartially. Avoid forcing conclusions at your own risk. Do not spend away all
that you have and all that you get. Manage to maintain a comfortable-sized bank
position. Try to have an attractive home. Then you are the KING, THE UNCROWNED
KING.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. If the sub-lord of your Ascendant is in
the constellation of a planet in VIRGO:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Your nature is to be chatty. You will be
analytical and during conversation, you generally give disgustingly lengthy
description, including all meticulous detail which will be boring to others.
You keenly observe others' faults and idiocyncrasies and you find pleasure in
passing your remarks. You cannot be at rest till such time the criticism is
passed by you. Members of your family will never relish. You should not have
nervousness and self-doubt. You are intelligent. You quickly perceive. Yet you
need steadiness in going after what you want. Remember, you can achieve your
goal only when you avoid change of tactics, now and then whenever needed. Try
to complete one work and then take up the other. Your bad habit of consulting
everybody and confusing yourself should be given up. Therefore, you should
consult only one doctor, only one Astrologer and so on. Otherwise you will be
confused. Develop true consistency of purpose. Forget and forgive other</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s faults. In married life, unless great care is taken to avoid the
failings of your type, there is always the danger of matrimonial ship - wreck.
You care more for money and hence you will be absorbed in your business. You
always think of it, work very hard and return home very late and go next
morning very early which creates an impression in your wife</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s mind that you are indifferent hence your partner looks outside for
sympathy and company. So if you continue to live a strongly personal life, it
will lead to selfishness and at the same time another walk of life will get
shattered. Do not neglect hygiene. You need much relaxation. Prefer walking or
swimming. If not, keep the company of books which you may relish. Do not waste
your energy. Try to encash the same. No man in this world is perfect. So you
congratulate yourself for your good qualities and note down your weaknesses.
Correct yourself by avoiding the undesirable qualities and your lot will
definitely improve.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. If the sub - lord of your Ascendant is
in the constellation of a planet in LIBRA: -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EMOTIONS IN CHECK.
You should not allow things to get out of your hands. You should not appoint
persons of opposite sex as your private secretaries. You will be wasting much
of your time. You generally mix business and your pleasure. This will prove to
be harmful in the long run. You have a fertile brain; many ideas will flash in
your mind and they spring up one after another quickly. Therefore, you should
try to take quick decision then and there and act. It is your habit to observe
how others dress; also you note the mannerisms of others. You try to copy them
and waste a lot; it is advisable to know your ability and so to have a limit.
You are generally unassuming and simple. Therefore, clever people will take
advantage of your innocence and try to fool you. So, you have to consider
carefully and make the best choices of the associates. You should deal with
them carefully because you have broad outlook and even when you find them to be
wrong, you forgive and forget the faults of such people; they may act against
your interest; you can come to know of it and forgive them; but don't forget
their action. You should know what harm is done by a person and how he had
misbehaved, understand that the individual cannot be relied upon. You also
believe that every new occasion demands a new dress and, therefore, you will
spend much more than what you can afford, on cosmetics and perfumes. You should
know that God has given you enough charm. A little of the makeup may do but you
do not require so much as you use. You waste money on that score. You have to
be very careful with the other sex as you are gentle, soft and weak with the
opposite sex; if you remain for a long period unmarried and if you live in a
hostel or away from your home for some length of time, then you will be tamed
by an unscrupulous person of opposite sex who has desire to dominate and
possess you. In case of a woman the peril is graver. Therefore, try to avoid
the company of the other sex. You may have appendicitis or uterus trouble;
kidney may be affected. To maintain good health it is necessary for you to take
rest and retire whenever you feel like that; have balanced diet; keep yourself
cheerful; be happy; enjoy life by listening to light music.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. If the sub - lord of your Ascendant is
in the constellation of a planet in SCORPIO: -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You generally over - estimate yourself and
thereby invite trouble. You do not care for others</span>’<span lang="EN-US">
opinion or how others would receive your criticism. So better have a control
and do not pass any sarcastic remark. You wrongly, expect that everybody should
be as intelligent as you are. And, therefore, there will be dissatisfaction and
irritation. So do not expect all your subordinates to be either as clever or as
hardworking as you are. Don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t be over critical; they
will feel dejected. So, whenever there are occasions for you to lose your
temper, try to overcome them. Whenever you move with ladies be a little
careful; try to avoid the secret enmity of the other sex. Don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t stoop to foul play or wrong accounting or any other unlawful
action. Even if you have to lose, allow the loss; if you wait for sometime you
can regain, all that lost by you. For that purpose, do not adopt any unfair
means. Do not cultivate the habit of drinking otherwise you would require a
swimming pool of the intoxicating drinks. As you do everything with energy and
might, if you are bad, you are really very bad and there is no mistaking about
it. Your courage never fails, your will is ever strong and your patience is
many - fold stronger than those of others. Don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t make
shipwreck of your life, developing into that of a reckless insatiable drinker
or heartless profligate. If you are a doctor, generally you give strong dose of
medicine weakening the patient</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s heart while dosing him
for rheumatism and also you ruin his digestion. So always try to give the
minimum dose to your patients. Whenever your health fails, you have to strictly
follow the instructions of your medical attendant. Whenever you suffer from
dysentry etc. you generally take hot stuff with much chilly, pickles etc. You
must avoid. In your office you must avoid mixing with people who advocate to go
on strike. If you take any part, in it then you will lead them. Naturally, you
will become a social fire - brand and a dangerous person in the eyes of the
community. When thorns are removed, what is it that remains? Roses. So also,
understand that if you exercise some care and if you are polite, you can enjoy
all the fruits of life in this world.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9. If the sub - lord of your Ascendant is
in the constellation of a planet in SAGITTARIUS: -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally you are inherently selfish and
inconsiderate. You may lack loyalty and sympathy. You easily forget the good
done to you in the past by others. You may do anything to please yourself which
may be undesirable and you do not care for your prestige or honour, yet, the
faults of your type are not serious. They are flimsy and hence easily
pardonable. You will be excused; you do not forget and leave it. You continue
to feel jealous and remain vindictive. You are absolutely incapable of uttering
a lie cogently and coherently or cheat anybody successfully. You will have no
face to meet them again, since you will be caught during your attempts.
Otherwise, whenever you talk, you go tangentially and also during the
conversation introduce needless extraneous matter which will bore others. Lack
of purpose, shallowness, lack of ability to concentrate are your weaknesses.
You waste a lot, not realising that it is a great sin. You ever waste your
energy, your money and also your materials. You go round a circle without
serving any purpose. You are very courageous and you act; you feel satisfied if
the result follows your own boasting. If you are unable to fulfil, if there is
opposition, you lose your temper. You have vanity. You do not accept failure.
You do not enjoy that much which you can because of your hasty actions. You do
not enjoy that much which you can because of your hasty actions. You may be
indifferent to your family life. You do not attend upon them properly. You
create such an impression that you forget to do your duty. It is also not
uncommon to commit a blunder while selecting a partner. You are in a haste
while settling the marriage and later in leisure and in solitude, you repent.
Why? You could have gone slow, have some persons in view, observe them before
taking a decision and then select the best out of the lot. You may say </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Hanging and wiving go by destiny</span>”<span lang="EN-US">. Let it
be, you try to improve and make your honest attempts to avoid troubles in
future. As regards health, you have to take care of your pulmonary system.
Bronchitis is your common disease. Do not expose to severe cold. Do not give
much of over - activity to your mind or body. There should be a limit in having
exercise also. Read the above carefully. Correct yourself properly. Never be in
a hurry. Then no more worry. Be ever merry.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10. If the sub - lord of your Ascendant is
in the constellation of a planet in CAPRICORN: -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You are over ambitious both to make money
and also to acquire power. You assert yourself in your work where you serve and
you always think of yourself alone. You are not unaware of your worth and your
capacity. You are efficient and realistic; you are very selfish especially in
search of power. You contemplate, dream and you make efforts entertaining
hopes. You live on hopes, you are mostly optimistic. But you become desperate
and broken - hearted whenever you meet with failure and when there is undue delay
in the realisation of your ambitions; so it leads you to overwork and exert too
much. Your health will not permit so much of strain. Further mentally also you
always contemplate, mediate and tax yourself very much. Due to overstrain you
will feel fatigued. You should develop dignity and diplomacy and avoid
nervousness and discontent. You have an intense desire to influence others, to
manage them direct them and also persuade them. You meddle with others in one
way or the other. This causes irritation in your friends and also in your close
relatives. You must learn to understand and control yourself. As regards the
sex, you are incorrigible. You should know that you will have best period
between your age of 56 and 70, therefore, you have to be working without much
expectation in your early days and ultimately you will find that your patience
has paid you amply in the end. You may become lazy, sluggish, due to the poor
results you have in earlier days; but cultivate activity. Never be worried and
be gloomy; otherwise digestive system will become weak and flatulence may be
caused. Your health is also so fragile and weak that very easily you are upset
by pulmonary affection also. It is also not uncommon that people working with
much of anxiety and over strain at last suffer from heart disease. None has
gained anything by merely worrying. Be active. Do not be selfish. You will have
Grand Success in your life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11. If the sub - lord of the Ascendant is
in the constellation of the planet in AQUARIUS:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You always prefer solitude; generally you
do not relish to be in the midst of a crowd nor work in the midst of a group of
workers where there is much noise. You try to be lonely but you should know
that you would become lazy and lethargic when you are left alone. You should
cultivate activity and promptness especially when things do not shape as you
expect. What is the use of getting worried of feeling gloomy. Do not be a
pessimist; but you have to repeat the process with greater earnestness when you
will surely be successful. You should never lack in the push nor in the
courage. Be alert, have confidence and work within pleasure. You may not follow
the tradition; you may act in a way which indicates that the laws are not
intended for you. You will not hesitate to do any unusual and irregular things.
Even in dress you are a peculiar person. You have your own individuality and
mannerism. You should know that we have to live in a world where we have to
keep with certain standard and we have to be one in the society. On some
occasions, you have the tendency to vacillate and thereby take long time to do
a thing since you cannot come to a decision before judging the advantages and
disadvantages of anything that you have to undertake or do. You may have
sluggish circulation of blood, manifesting in cold hands and feet. The best
remedy would be to have fresh air and good friendship. It is advisable to walk
amidst beautiful scenery with a pleasant companion. Do not be contemplating and
planning over and over again; give rest to the mind and to the body.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then pleasant life is promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12. If the sub - lord of the Ascendant is
in the constellation of the planet in PISCES: -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You have a very bad tendency of brooding
over things and becoming gloomy whenever matters don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t
come up as you expect. All can</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t have artesian wells.
You have to exert yourself, pump and get water. You also mistake that to
whomsoever you have rendered help, they have not reciprocated to you properly
in time. Therefore, whatever you want to do for the people, do it without any
thought of reward of gratitude. You are sensitive timid and afraid of any
trouble. There is also another defect in you; you approach friends, one after
another, for advice, but later, you do not make use of any of the advice
offered to you; you pay no attention to it. It is really, very bad. You try to
gain sympathy from others by narrating your series of troubles. This ultimately
weakness your position. You are aware that you are moody. So what is the use of
worrying for sometime and becoming normal again. Never be little yourself nor
be slow in your action; have confidence, be pushful; be generous; you need not
be over - liberal; don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t entertain hopes on other</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s promises, as some of them may be fulfilled, whereas others may be
found to take promises. Don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t be building castles in
the air. You should also realise that it is really very difficult for your
partner to understand you and equally difficult to cope up with you. Have a
control upon your romantic life. Otherwise like a rudderless boat, you will be
drifted on into the sea of sensual pleasures. Every wind which blows, will
bring you new experiences to spoil you more and more. You will be very
sensitive to the influence of alcohol. Your health will be weak and muscular
power deficient. Pay attention to cleanliness of your person, habitation and
clothing. Try to have plenty of fresh air and sunshine. There will react
favourably on the emotional and mental plan. A simple vegetarian diet is often
advisable, include cereals and fruit. You may develop your psychic power. You
will enjoy your life with good health having large number of friends. Peace and
pleasure be upon you.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.48_WHICH GEM CAN I USE.html">← WHICH GEM CAN I USE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.49_ROAD TO SUCCESS">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.50_VIMSHOTHARI DASA – UDU DASA.html">VIMSHOTHARI DASA–UDU DASA →</a></div></body>
