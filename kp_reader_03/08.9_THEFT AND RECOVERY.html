Vidya Bhavan, Madras Kendhra on 8 - 11 - 64.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some of my jewels, silver articles, silk
sarees and cash were stolen away from my house during the day time (between 8 -
15 a.m. and 12.30 p.m.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You took my horoscope and also asked me to
give a number within 108. I told you 16.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the class, you discussed and explained
and your students took notes also. You said "your property is intact. All
of them will be returned to you. One male and two females are involved in the
theft. You will be called to identify the property after 10 - 1 - '65. The
thief will be black in complexion. He is a youngman. He will be caught by the
police when he makes similar attempts. Be cheerful and thank God that you are
lucky to have them back. I suggest you to have a "Godrej" or "Allwyn"
or "Khira" Almirah in your house. Also, let me know in February or
March, what happened."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The thief was caught on 20 - 1 - 1965. He
is a young man black in colour. He is an ex - convict. Two women were also
involved. He is a dangerous K.D.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Except 3 articles worth about 3 sovereigns,
all the gold jewels, all silk sarees and all silver vessels etc., were
recovered from him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Articles worth about 6 sovereigns were
melted away by him and he made two pairs of bangles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I am glad to say that the thief was
convicted and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for four years. The stolen
property worth Rs. 3,000 was handed over to me.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I place on record my deep and sincere
appreciation of your correct prediction about the stolen property.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I thank you immensely because your uncanny
prediction, boldly declared in the presence of nearly 60 students, in such a
detail, gave me and my wife sufficient strength to withstand the shock when we
were worried about the loss of property and with that mental strength due to
the faith in your prediction, we were able to wait calmly till the thief was
caught.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yours faithfully,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(Sd) S. GOVINDAN</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On 8 - 11 - '64, the map of the heavens was
as follows.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="535" src="img/image027.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Bhavas</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1.

Jupiter - Retrograde.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The number given was 16. Therefore divide
16 by 9. Quotient is 1. Remainder is 7. Therefore 1st sign Aries is over: The
7th pada in Taurus is the Lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Because, the Zodiac is 360</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. It is divided by 12 spokes. Therefore each arc is 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in longitude. They are called Rasi: sign or solar mansion. The same
Zodiac is divided into 27 equal parts; each is 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20';
each is called an asterism, star, constellation or Nakshathra. Each star is
divided into 4 equal parts and each part called pada or quarter will be 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20'. Hence the Zodiac is divided into 108 equal parts. And, the
number mentioned by the querist is that pada counted from Aries 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> or Mesha 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> or Aswini Nakshathra, first
pada. Hence No. 16 is to be divided by 4 (four padas in each star): 16 can be
divided by 4 times and the remainder will be Zero, i.e., 4 full Stars, i.e.,
Aswini, Bharani, Karthika and Rohini. A doubt arises whether to take Rohini 4th
pada or Mrigasira first quarter. As 16th part of the 108 divisions is to be
taken, take Rohini 4th quarter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One should divide the number given by the
querist, in such a way, that there is some remainder, either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.
So 16 is to be divided by 4 only thrice and should have a remainder of 4.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore number 16 means Rohini 4th pada,
i.e. 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' in Taurus.
The Navamsa Lagna is Cancer, a movable sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lagna and the aspect to either the
ascendant or to the lord of the ascendant indicates whether one can have a
favourable answer from the astrologer or not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon and the aspect of Moon indicates the
nature of the query, the case of his worry etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Taurus rises. Its ruler is Venus. It
appears to be debilitated in the rasi but it is exalted in Navamsa. It is 108</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> away from the ascendant i.e., the aspect from the lord of the Lagna
to the Ascendant is favourable. Therefore, first tell the querist that No.16
promises him "Good Luck". This is the duty of the astrologer. Then
analyse, think loud, make him understand that you apply the science in full and
give your prediction without any doubt. Never use the words </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Likely</span>”<span lang="EN-US">, </span>“<span lang="EN-US">May</span>”<span lang="EN-US">, </span>“<span lang="EN-US">I think</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is in Sagittarius. No doubt, it is the
8th sign. But it is in Moolam second quarter. So it comes to 7th Bhava or house
as the Lagna is between 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon in the 7th house indicates litigation
or theft. Moon in Ketu</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Star Moolam and in conjunction
with Ketu shows that the querist is confused and is very much worried.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the querist has already informed that he
had lost his property, it is for the astrologer to find out (a) whether the
person will have the property back or not, (b) the description of the thief or
thieves and (c) the time when he can recover the stolen property.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s possessions
are indicated by the 2nd, 4th and 11th houses. Second house shows the movable
property, the 4th house signifies the immovable property, and the 11th house
denotes one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s profit and savings. Lord of 2 Mercury
should indicate his readily cashable possessions and other movable properties.
As the node Rahu is in Gemini (though in Lagna Bhava) Rahu, automatically
becomes the agent of Mercury. Hence Rahu indicates his movable property.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun, the lord of the 4th house, is in 6.
6th house is 12th to 7th. Hence it indicates loss to the thief: at least no
gains, no benefit to the thief by Sun who denotes permanent possession.
Actually the person has not lost any property-land or building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house is Pisces. No planet is in
Pisces. Jupiter rules the sign. It is in the 12th house. So his saving is lost,
but it is retrograde. So, the loss is only for a temporary period. If Jupiter
would have been in direct motion and if the 11th house is unoccupied, he can
never get the lost property. A planet, in direct motion, gives a result and
confirms it. A planet, in retrograde, will produce a result which will fall
through when it takes direct motion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter owns two houses, Sagittarius and
Pisces. Rahu or Ketu in either of the two, is stronger than Jupiter, Ketu is in
Sagittarius. Therefore Ketu is stronger than Jupiter. It is ever retrograde. It
is in the second sign to the seventh Cusp and is in the 7th house (i.e. Lagna
of the thief. Ketu who is to represent Jupiter as lord of 2 to the 7th house is
in the thief</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Lagna Bhava in retrograde). Hence Ketu
indicates that the thief cannot have the property as his own, for ever.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, the querist will get back the
stolen property, without fail. So, declare that the lost ones will surely be
recovered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly consider the 11th house (house of
profit) to the thief i.e. 11th to the 7th. Scorpio is the 7th house. Virgo is
the 11th to it. Mercury rules that sign. It is in direct motion and is in the
6th Bhava to Taurus </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> i.e., 12th to the 7th Cusp and
7th house. Therefore Mercury threatens that he cannot have them for ever.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The description of the thief or thieves is
judged from the seventh house. Scorpio is the seventh house. Its ruler is Mars.
According to the Hindus, Mars aspects Scorpio. Hence Mars, a masculine planet
owning the seventh house, strong in triplicity, aspecting the seventh house
indicates that the thief is a male, a young man and a bold culprit. Mars
aspected by Saturn, occupying Leo suggests that he will be dark in complexion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The seventh Bhava is occupied by Moon and
Ketu. Rahu and Ketu will give first, the result of the planets with which they
are conjoined and then only the results of the lord of the sign. As Moon is
feminine, Moon and Ketu indicate two ladies. Ketu which is to indicate the
results of Jupiter who owns the second house to the seventh, has actually done
his work. Because, the fact is that the two women were involved in disposing a
portion of the property (second house is to make money; convert into cash etc.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore a young blackman and two other
ladies should be the culprits.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When can he have the property?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To regain what one has lost is a fortune.
Such fortunate results can be given only by the lord of the 11th house. The
eleventh house is owned by Jupiter. So he must gain strength so that the person
can have his property. At the time of query, it was retrograde. So, he cannot
have them, during the period of Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s retrograde
motion. Jupiter becomes stationary and takes direct motion on 10th January
1965. Therefore, you cannot have it before 10 - 1 - '65, so, do not worry at
all. Wait. After 10 - 1 - '65, you must have it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati Jupiter
should transit in the star of the lord of the 12th house to the 7th i.e., 6th
house and the sub of the second or 11th house. Jupiter, after direct motion,
can transit only in the star of Venus (lord of the 12th house to the seventh)
and in the sub of Mercury in Bharani star. That is, according to Nirayana
system Jupiter should transit between 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 31</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> i.e. between 5th February 1965 and 19th
February 1965. Actually you have received them only then.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When Can I Commit theft successfully?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Conjoined period and Subperiod of the
Significators of 2, 6 and 11 and not connected with 5 or 8 or 12, show that one
can gain by theft successfully.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.8_FREE FROM DEBTS.html">← FREE FROM DEBTS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.9_THEFT AND RECOVERY">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.10_BROTHERS AND SISTERS.html">BROTHERS AND SISTERS →</a></div></body>
