<body><h2 id="heading_08.21_WILL STAMMERING DISAPPEAR_0"><span lang="EN-US">WILL STAMMERING DISAPPEAR</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The twelve signs of the Zodiac rule certain
parts of the body: One should not ignore that each sign has also subsidiary
dominion over the part of the body denoted by the sign 180 away, i.e. opposite
sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Max Heindel and Augusta Foss Heindel have
said Affliction of Gemini may cause Bronchitis or weaken the arms and
shoulders, but Sciatica, a Sagittarius disease, may also result. Taurus rules
the throat; it has great sympathy with Scorpio, the sign that rules the
generative organs, hence we note the change of voice in boys at the time of
puberty; also woman, when she forsakes the path of chastity and leads a life of
debauch, acquires a coarser voice. Taurus rules the larynx, but Mercury governs
the air which stirs the vocal cords to vibrations, There is similar relation
between Taurus (ruling the vocal organs) and Mercury (ruling the air which
passes through the larynx) as between instrument and player. If Taurus (and
Scorpio) are unafflicted, the vocal organ is in good condition, but an
afflicted Mercury my nevertheless cause a functional disorder of the speech.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the following two horoscopes let us see
how the speech is affected. There is no free flow of speech. There is the
impediment. It is a defect. It is not a disease. According to Krishnamurti
padhdhati one is to judge the sub-lord of the 2nd Cusp. (Because among twins,
one is an orator; the other stammers. Planets, Bhavas everything remain the
same position. Only the cusps of each house changes. Professor Krishnamurti has
discovered this truth which neither the Savants of Western Countries nor the
Saints of our India had so far thought of or taught to us.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Professor Krishnamurti says if the sublord
of the 2nd cusp is Mercury, one speaks a lot, best fitted for Insurance agent,
salesman, propagandist, etc. if the sub-lord is Mars, one will be blunt and
outspoken; it is Saturn, he speaks a little and he drags on; if Jupiter, wise
talk; if Venus, mostly the talk will be about the other sex or sexual life. If
it is Rahu or Ketu, defect in speech. If Rahu or Ketu is in 12, defect in
vision; if they are in 2, defect in speech.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.21_WILL STAMMERING DISAPPEAR_1"><span lang="EN-US">Horescope 1</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="514" src="img/image043.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus Dasa balance 15 years 1 month 24
days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second cusp is in the constellation of a
watery planet and sub of Ketu (Mute signs are watery sign, Voice signs are airy
signs).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence note where Ketu is. It is in the
second sign. It has to signify 2nd house result also. Rahu which is in the
opposite sign is in Ketu sub. Therefore, stammering must continue till Rahu
Dasa Ketu Bhukti is over.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the dasa lord receives beneficial aspect
from Jupiter, Rahu itself will start improving one's speech by reducing
stammering.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu Dasa Venus Bhukti Jupiter Anthra
onwards, stammering will disappear. i.e. November 1970, when Sun transits in
Venus sign, Rahu star.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.21_WILL STAMMERING DISAPPEAR_2"><span lang="EN-US">Horescope 2</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="523" src="img/image044.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2nd cusp is in Saturn sign Jupiter star and
Ketu sub. Further Rahu is to offer the 2nd house results also. Hence there is
stammering. Mars afflicting Ketu or 2nd house by conjunction or aspect, the
person takes much pain to speak out. If Jupiter conjoins or aspects, it is by
Divine Grace, one will have the cure.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.20_HEALTH AND HEART.html">← HEALTH AND HEART</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.21_WILL STAMMERING DISAPPEAR">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.22_TIME OF MARRIAGE _K.P.html">TIME OF MARRIAGE _K.P →</a></div></body>
