fountain from which springs events in one's life. What is promised in the
radical chart in accordance with one's karma will unfold itself in the form of
good or bad events at some time or other in one's life. Hindu sages have
devised several methods to predict the time of events, of which the Udu
(Nakshathra) Dasa system propounded by Maharishi Parasara is most widely
followed. In the west, however they resort to a system known as Progression or
Directions to find out when the events indicated by the natural horoscope will
crystallise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The planets are ever moving in the Zodiac,
each in its own orbit and are never stationary though at times they appear to
be standing or still, retrograde as viewed from the Earth. No two planets
perform a revolution in the Zodiac in the same period. Speed being varied.
Thus, when we observe from the Earth a planet sometimes appears to overtake and
pass another planet, then stop and later beginning to move forward. After
birth, the planets move away, each at a different rate, from the original
positions occupied by them at the time of birth. In this process, they take up
new places in the signs (Zodiac) and in the houses wherefrom they form certain
aspects not only among themselves producing certain events in the mundane
sphere but to their own radical positions, the positions of other planets at
birth and to other sensitive points in the radical horoscope such as the
Fortuna and the cusps of the houses. The movement of the planets after birth
measures the time when the events denoted by the birth chart will culminate.
This motion of the planets after birth is called </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Progression</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The birth horoscope is all important. The
progressed horoscope is only a projection of the birth chart and indicates the
changes taking place in the individual within the imposed limits at birth. As
Sepharlimits says </span>“<span lang="EN-US">It is the root in the soil which the
tree of life grows</span>”<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Progression is one of the useful methods to
time events. In India we mainly follow the Vimshodhari Dasa system which offer
astoundingly accurate results when Krishnamurti Padhdhati is employed.
Progression can help supplement the Udu Dasa system. Transits also serve a very
useful purpose in finding out the actual month and date when a certain event
will crystallize.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Separate book on progression is being
published shortly.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.51_KENDRA ADHIPATHYANA.html">← KENDRA ADHIPATHYANA</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.52_PROGRESSION">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.53_ANNUAL HOROSCOPE.html">ANNUAL HOROSCOPE →</a></div></body>
