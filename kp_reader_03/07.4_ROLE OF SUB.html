<body><h2 id="heading_07.4_ROLE OF SUB_0"><span lang="EN-US">ROLE OF SUB</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sign : A sign is one of the 12 equal
divisions of the zodiac. Each sign has its own characteristics and, the planets
occupying such signs offer results modified by the characteristics of that
sign. The strength of planets is judged by noting the sign occupied by it </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> whether it gets exalted or debilitated; whether it is Swakshethra
or vargothamamsa or in friendly quarters or enemy</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
camp, etc. The planet in a sign is the source of the result which it bestows
according to the lord of the constellation in which the planet was tenanted.
The nature of the results which the planet gives includes whether the planet is
in a positive or negative sign; in a fiery or earthy or airy or watery sign; in
a movable or fixed or common sign, in a fruitful or a barren sign; in mute or
voice sign; in violent or human sign; in a bestial or dual sign etc. All these
must be taken into consideration before judging what a planet can do. The Rasi
occupied by a planet indicates the strength of the planet.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Star: In every sign, eventhough there are
only 2 1/4 constellation, yet the lords will be three in number. A planet in
any of the constellations will be under the sway of the lord of the
constellation. Therefore, a sign is divided into 3 major divisions. If a sign
were to indicate many results it is classified into 3 groups by the 3
constellations. For example, Taurus is ruled by Venus and all the results
indicated by Venus coupled with an earthy, fixed and negative sign are
attributed to Taurus. But in the same sign, there are 3 constellations called
karthik, Rohini and Mrigasira. Kartik is ruled by Sun, Rohini by Moon and
Mrigasira by Mars. Therefore the result indicated by Taurus are classified into
3 groups; a part of it is governed by Venus and Sun (Karthik Star; if a planet
were to be between 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
of Taurus at the time of the birth or at the time of the query or when a planet
transits between 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> of
Taurus, its results are modified by Venus and Sun). The second part is under
the influence of both Venus and Moon. (Rohini Star 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
Taurus to 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20 Taurus). The results indicated by the
planets in this area are under the influence of Venus and Moon. And the third
part is governed by Venus and Mars; those matters signified by both of them are
grouped together and the planets occupying 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> -20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> to 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. Taurus will be influenced by Venus
and Mars. The matters signified jointly by them will be offered by the planet
occupying the star or transiting in this area. Therefore, instead of giving
many probabilities according to the sign, the three constellations divide them
into three groups.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub : As regards the sub, it is the 9
divisions of each constellation in the proportion in which they are allotted
total number of years in Vimshottari dasa. What results the lord of the sign
and the lord of the constellation jointly indicate are again divided into 9
groups. Therefore the sign Lord, the star Lord and the Sub Lord reduce the
number of probabilities to be chosen for prediction. Such subdivision is found
necessary not only to differentiate the results indicated by two planets but
also the cusps in the same constellation. For example, twins are born; one
having its meridian in Venus sign Taurus in Moon Star - Rohini and in the sub
of Saturn. This person deals in Petrol. But, the next born will have his
Meridian in Venus sign Taurus in Moon star - rohini and in the sub of Mercury.
This brother deals in Cotton and Silk products. Let us take another example.
One of the twins born with Meridian in 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Leo is an
educationist and an advocate. Because the Meridian has fallen in Leo ruled by
Sun in Poorvapalguni Star governed by Venus and in the sub of Jupiter who
indicates Law and Education. But the other twin whose Meridian was in 27</span>°<span lang="EN-US">is a Medical gentleman because this point in the zodiac in Leo is
owned by Sun, in Uttrapalguni Star governed by Sun and also in the sub of Sun.
Thus twins born at an interval of a few minutes having the lagna in the same
sign at different degrees, the position of the planets in the same degree,
experience different results. While joining the College, one gets admission in
the Law college whereas the other studies in Medical College and later their
profession also is entirely different. Third example: Twins were born, one in 7</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 41</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> in Moon sign cancer, Saturn Star Pushya
and in the sub of Kethu, the other twin was born in 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
-20</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> in Moon sign Cancer, Saturn Star Pushya and in the
sub of Mars. The earlier born in Kethu sub died immediately after birth whereas
the 2nd born lived long. No doubt, the second born had a fragile constitution
in youth and later he picked up. Therefore, even though a constellation may
indicate many results, it is the sub which decides which of them applies to an
individual. A constellation extends to 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> -20</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> whereas a sub extends between 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> -40</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> to 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 13</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> -20</span>”<span lang="EN-US">. Therefore the broad prediction indicated by a constellation is
specifically defined by the sub. A person may have his Meridian in 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. If we take only the sign for the prediction for their processing
we consider the sign Aries and its Lord Mars, the navamsa lord, etc. But if we
include the constellation, then we take into our judgement both the planets
Mars and the Lord of the Constellation Venus who rules between 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> -20</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> and 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> -40</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> Aries. But if one uses this sub, then one finds, that a person has
his Meridian in Mars sign, Venus Star and Jupiter sub whereas the other person
has meridian in mars, sign, Venus Star, Saturn sub. Both are Sanitary
Inspectors. One works in Animal Husbandry Department who has his meridian in
Mars sign, Venus Star, Jupiter Sub, as Jupiter is the chief governor for production
and progeny whereas the other is working in the slaughter house where animals
are killed, as Saturn the sub - lord is the Karaka for </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Death</span>”<span lang="EN-US">. So, a person causes production of
animals whereas the other causes destruction of them. Hence health, disease,
longevity, education, profession etc., can be clearly and correctly predicted
only when the sub is included.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is not taken into consideration, an
astrologer is to predict that a person may deal with quadrupeds. He cannot say
as to whom of the two is in animal husbandry and who in the slaughter house. A
third person having his Meridian in 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> -50</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> of Aries thus having it in Mars sign, Venus star, sun sub works as
Veterinary Surgeon. To clearly indicate the profession, one can find that the
sub serves useful purpose and gives correct and clear prediction. This alone is
needed.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose planets A, B, C and D are in
Sagittarius (Dhanus) between 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> -40</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> to 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US">.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dhanus is ruled by Jupiter.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Longitude 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> -40</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> to 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> is governed by Sun. The star is
Uthrashada.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Both rasi and Navamsa are Dhanus.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The modification to the planet A, B, C and
D is the same according to our ancient science. But according to Krishnamurti
Padhdhati Planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> which is

according to the sign. Dhanus ruled by Jupiter, the planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> instead of giving results according to
its nature and lordship, offers the results indicated by the lord of the
constellation Sun. The lord of the constellation may indicate many matters. But
the lord of the sub, eliminates many of them and specifies a particular matter.

</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore one can note that hundreds of
professions are indicated by the sign - Sagittarius - Dhanus. But if we take
constellations, each represents a few dozens of them. Sub exactly fixes the
profession.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, he who has the planets, A, B, C
and D and if he runs </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">A</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> dasa,
he will then be magnanimous, reliable, honest, serve in Education Department or
bank or be a physician.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But when he runs the period of the planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">B</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> he may be a politician or benefitted by a

Department, or an orator or a mayor or a minister.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Planet </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">D</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> may authorize him as one of the visitors of jails.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus the planet within these 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> - 20</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> has to indicate many varieties. When
the sub is applied, one can eliminate most of them and pinpoint on very few
items which alone is helpful to the querist.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If one gives a list of appointments
assigned to a sign just like the server presents a large number of items in a </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Menu</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> card in a hotel, what a task it is to
make further selection. Specific ones are needed in those days, just like one
wants to know the special dish of the day.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose there is a planet in a sign. Then,
the planet is the source of light. It indicates the source of a result which a
native enjoys by its nature, ownership etc.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the planet is significator of 1, he
gains by his own efforts and influence. If it is significator of 3, through
brother or publication, he gains or loses, depending on the sub. If it is
significator of 4, through mother or the matters signified by the 4th house, he
has that result. If it is significator of 5, through speculation, music or
children he enjoys the result. Thus the planet who transits or the planet whose
period is running, shows how one gets the result, how a result is brought
about, etc.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sign indicates the extent to which one
can enjoy as it shows whether the planet is strong or weak in that Sign.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The lord of the constellation is that which
shows the nature of the RESULT, i.e. in which house, the lord of the
constellation is deposited and the house or houses it owns. Then the matters
signified by those houses will manifest.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose the lord of the constellation owns
the houses 3 and 10, i.e. Mars to Aquarius - borns or Venus to Leo - borns and
they are occupying 3rd house from Aquarius or Leo respectively, then the planet
in Mars constellation to Aquarius - borns or that in Venus constellation for
Leo - borns shows that one corresponds, interviews or makes a short journey for
a job. Then the favourable or unfavourable sub denotes whether he is successful
or not. When? It will be during the conjoined period of the planet, star lord
and sub - lord.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a planet transits in a sign, e.g.
take Jupiter.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to the principles available one
cannot definitely state when one can have its beneficial results and also what
result one can expect at a particular time. But by studying this book one can
give correct prediction.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose in a small post office, one posts,
say, 44 letters, All the 44 are put in one bag. So the contents indicate 44
places. If these are distributed into 3 bags, one may contain 19, the other 19
and the third 6. If there are 22 bags each for different places, these 44 will
be distributed to the 22 bags on an average at two per bag. If one bag is
missing, only now, it is easy for one to mention from the missing bag, to which
places the letters belong. If all are thrown in one bag, one can say, that two
of the 44 are missing and it is not possible to specify. If they are
distributed in 3 bags, even then, it cannot be specified. But if it is
distributed to 22 bags, (22 subs in one sign) it is easy to pitch up.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, a planet in the sub of an evil
planet, indicates loss, difficulty or failure whereas the same planet, in the
same star, but in the sub of a benefic, promises success, gain and pleasure.
The lord of the constellation may indicate the matters of the 7th house. The
planet in the sub of a malefic causes enmity whereas that in the sub of a
benefic brings in harmony and happiness. Also, the planet in the sub of an evil
one threatens loss in litigation whereas that in the sub of a benefic indicates
victory eventhough the constellation lord denotes litigation. If a planet
indicates business, the stars governed by this planet show business and the
planet in beneficial sub promises profit whereas that in the sub of an evil one
threatens loss. The lord of the constellation may show any one walk of life to
the native. It is the sub which decides whether that area is advantageous or
not and thereby indicates whether the planet occupying or transiting therein
will offer desirable results or adverse ones.  </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="07.3_WHAT EACH STAR SIGNIFIES TO EACH LAGNA OR RASI BORNS.html">← WHAT EACH STAR SIGNIFIES TO EACH LAGNA OR RASI BORNS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_07.4_ROLE OF SUB">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="07.5_SIGNIFICANCE OF EACH SUB.html">SIGNIFICANCE OF EACH SUB →</a></div></body>
