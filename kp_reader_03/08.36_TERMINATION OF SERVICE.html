5, 9 &amp; 12 are to be judged. The 1st house is negation of 2nd
(self-acquisition). The 5th is negation of 6th (service). The 9th is negation
of 10th (status). The 12th is the general house of loss. Termination of service
takes place under the conjoined period of the planets connected with these
houses. The following Scientific Method is to be pursued uniformly to judge
such a problem. Let us take up one by one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 1st house is unoccupied. Its lord is
Sun. In its constellation Saturn is posited. Therefore, Saturn is a strong
significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 5th house is also unoccupied by any
planet. Its lord is Jupiter. Sun is in Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star,
but it happens to be in the 11th house - the house of gains. Jupiter being in
the constellation of the Moon, lord of 12 and occupant of 9th is stronger than
the Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 9th house is occupied by the Moon. Rahu
and Jupiter are in the constellation of the Moon. Mars, the lord of 9th, in the
constellation and sub of Mercury - lord of 2 and 11, is in 4 and so only a
feeble significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 12th house is occupied by Venus. Saturn
is posited in the Sub of Venus. The Moon rules the 12th and is placed in the
9th. Rahu and Jupiter, in the constellation of the Moon are stronger than the
Moon, to give the effects of the 9th and 12th houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The readers will be surprised to note that
the significators discussed above conjointly brought about Termination of
Service during Rahu Dasa, Jupiter Bhukti, Saturn Anthra, i.e., from 18-3-1969
to 5-8-1969. The houses 1, 5, 9 &amp; 12, fully played their role. It is a
sufficient proof of the efficacy of K.P.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.35_TRANSFER.html">← TRANSFER</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.36_TERMINATION OF SERVICE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.37_WHEN WILL I RETIRE.html">WHEN WILL I RETIRE →</a></div></body>
