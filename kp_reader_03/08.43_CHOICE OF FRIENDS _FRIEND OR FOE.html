<body><h2 id="heading_08.43_CHOICE OF FRIENDS _FRIEND OR FOE_0"><span lang="EN-US">CHOICE OF FRIENDS _FRIEND OR FOE</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By friendship, it does not mean that
everyone can expect something or other from the friend; either by his physical
labour or correct advice or by assisting at the time when one needs. But a
person is to be considered as a friend -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) if he never thinks evil, never does
harm, or is observing the mischievous action of the evil-doers, though he may
not connive at it,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) if he gives moral support and acts as
an intelligent minister;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) if possible, lend assistance when one
demands or needs it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One is a real and useful friend if he
understands the situation of a person and helps the person to fulfil his
desire.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrologically, 11th house indicates
realisation of one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s ambition. It also denotes elder
brother, real friends, permanent friends, one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s gains
or the assistance received by one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) If lord of 11 is in the constellation
and sublord of 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 or 11, that person will have friendship with one
who will be helpful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) If lord of 11 is in the constellation
and sub of planets signifying the matters of houses 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 or 12, the
person will be a loser through his friend. Lord of 11 or planet signifying 11th
house matters in the sub of 1 denotes sincere and permanent friend who will
materially help. Lord of 11 or planet signifying 11th house matters in the
constellation of lord of 2 or sub of 2 indicate that one can make money and
gain through friends. Some will give encouragement by offering mental solace
while the person is depressed and in many words give the person confidence.
Lord of 11 or planet connected with 11th house matters in the constellation of
lord of 3 or sub of 3 give chance to make friends during short journey or by
correspondence and it may be for a short time. If lord of 3 is also lord of 12,
then this person, on a later date will prove to be a scoundrel, cheat and
secret enemy. Never talk to such rogues. In weak moment if you hint anything
they will build up, give shape to it and either write anonymous letters or
betray the person.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A person born in Cancer Lagna had his Venus
in Revathi constellation ruled by lord of 3 and 12. He had a friend born in
Virgo owned by Mercury. The friend knowing every secret of the person gave
information at such a time that the person was arrested a couple of hours
before his daughter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s wedding, when there was a large
gathering. This scoundrel did not attend the marriage. Hence those who are born
in Cancer or Capricorn should never make friendship with those whose ruling
planets are Mercury and Jupiter, respectively. If lord of 11 or significator of
11th house matters were to be in the constellation of lord of 4 and 9, do not
make friendship with those whose ruling planets are the lords of 4 and 9. Such
friends are for taking money and material and never remaining grateful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it were to be in the constellation of
lord of 5, you will always lose, the so-called friend will ever gain. It is
very true if lord of 5 is also lord of 8 or 12. This is invariably true for
Gemini borns who will ever lose through friends born in Venus constellation, so
also Sagittarius-born through those born in Mars constellation; similarly
Aquarius-born lose through those whose ruling planet is Mercury; Leo borns lose
through Jupiterians. If it were to be in the constellation of lord of 6, he
never loses: the native gains. The friend gives and the native receives.
Suppose you are weak minded and you want to play cards. You play with such
people who are born in that constellation, lord of which is the lord of either
1 or 2 or 3 or 6 or 10 or 11. You will win. But if you play with those born in
that star (Nakshathre) lord of which rules the houses 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, or 12 in
your chart you have to lose.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the lord of 11, or planet signifying
11th house is in the constellation of lord of 7 or 8 or 9, you cannot rely on
him. He will be time-serving.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 11 in the constellation of lord of
10, most helpful and faithful friends. Reputation, honour, and prestige will be
on the increase. Such persons born in the constellation of lord of 10 will be a
good propagandist to make the person popular.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 11 in its own constellation brings
permanent friends who are very useful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 11 in the constellation of lord of
12 is dangerous. Never rely on persons born in the constellation of lord of 12.
They are your secret enemies. They cannot but be silly towards you. They will
behave as though they are low-born and ill-bred. They will talk pleasantly but
be planning to do harm. Never allow them inside. Stop them near the gate. Talk
and send them away. They do not deserve a better treatment from you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally one can have good friends if lord
of Lagna and lord of 11 form good aspects. Planets forming adverse aspects with
lord of Lagna show that people born with those planets as their ruling planets
cannot be good friends.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Malefics in the constellation of lord of 12
threaten that those born in their constellation can never be a faithful friend.
Ketu in 11 is also not auspicious. Cheating will be the motto.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Benefics in the constellation of lord of 12
indicate expenses with pleasure or purchases or investment. Planets in the
constellation of lord of 12 (benefics) show pleasant expenses, buying materials
or investing on lands, building, business, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if lord of 12 is a malefic and a planet
is in its constellation whichever house the planet may own or occupy, the
ultimate result is loss.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lord of 3 is in the constellation of
lord of 12, the loss or waste or anxiety or secret inimical activity will be
through neighbours or cousins or while making a short journey or by editing
publishing, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lord of 4 is in the constellation of
lord of 12, the loss may be through mother, conveyance, change of residence,
building, failure in education etc. If it is lord of 5, loss may be through
visitors, companions, music or musicians or children or through speculation or
pleasurable pursuits.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6th house lord denotes loss due to disease;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7th house lord denotes loss through
litigation, partner, wife or husband;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8th house lord denotes loss by repaying
prohibitive interest on the money borrowed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 9 indicates expenses through
strangers, father, long journey, high studies, etc. Father himself may prove to
be untrue to the person especially when lord of 9 is also lord of 12. A friend
of mine is born in Libra. Lord of 9 Mercury owns the 12th house also. Saturn
was in Ashlesha ruled by Mercury. During Saturn dasa, Mercury Bhukti, his
father gave away his possessions to another son and did not give anything to my
friend.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 10 shows change in service: illegal
gratification given for promotion. Lord of 11 in the constellation of lord of
12 indicates loss through elder brother or friend or son-in-law or
daughter-in-law.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lord of 12 is stronger than lord of 1 or
11, the secret enemy is more powerful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lord of 7 is stronger than lord of
Lagna, opponent is powerful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If lords of 1, 2, 6 and 11 are stronger
than lords of 7, 8, 12 and 5, the native ever gains, wins the litigation, comes
out victorious in election, passes through competitive examination, wins in
competition, etc.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.42_WILL I BE SELECTED AS A MINISTER.html">← WILL I BE SELECTED AS A MINISTER</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.43_CHOICE OF FRIENDS _FRIEND OR FOE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.44_GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS.html">GIVING OR RECEIVING GIFTS →</a></div></body>
