<body><h2 id="heading_08.47_ABOUT DRESS_0"><span lang="EN-US">ABOUT DRESS</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dress helps you to retain air of
distinction in a party or gathering. You can eat to please yourself; but you
have to please others by dress. You may be a great orator. Yet if you do not
dress properly people will laugh at you than to admire at your eloquence. For
that reason, one should not be the first for fashion nor the last. But one
should use comfortable, cheap and tasteful dress. Only fools will have the
variety of loving fine clothes and new fashions and value themselves by such a
dress. Avoid all things extravagant. Exquisite neatness is required. Outsiders
can see only how we dress but they can't see how we live or what we eat.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, you should be clever in making
selection of perfume, cosmetic, dress, etc. Your dress should be much pleasing
and also attracting the attention of others. You should have the knack for
choosing clothes which are not only attractive but also serving you long;
others should try to copy you. To enhance the personality, buy the diamonds,
jewellery, flower, etc. Your appearance will be stately if you put on such
colour which suits your birth sign. Dignity is to be maintained.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The colour of the dress varies with the
birth sign so also the perfumery, jewels, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is not only the attractive colour that
is to be chosen but one should find out, astrologically such a colour which
will bring fortune and which will be helpful to enjoy life with peace and
pleasure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further each sign-born should know which
day is the best to put on new dress. You should know that one should observe
the day when a new thing is used for the first time. One can buy on any day but
choice of the day to use it alone should be strictly observed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. If one puts on a new cloth when Moon is
in Aswini, one will have the fortune to get more and more dress.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. If Moon is in Bharani and one uses a new
