<body><h1 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_0"><span lang="EN-US">KRISHNAMURTI PADHADHATI PRACTICAL</span></h1><h2 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_1"><span lang="EN-US">PHYSICAL FEATURES</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally, the sign occupied by the lord of
the constellation in which Sublord of the Lagna at birth is, indicates whether
one is tall or short, stout or thin - build, etc. These Details are given under
each sign, in vol.1.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If we classify the 12 signs into 3 groups,
then the signs Gemini, Leo, Sagittarius and Aquarius contribute for good
height.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Aries, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio indicate
average height.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Taurus, Cancer, Capricorn and Pisces denote
shortness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of Lagna, in the beginning of a sign,
indicates tallness. As it proceeds to the middle of a sign, the person is above
average height; between the middle of the sign, and the end of the sign, one
becomes shorter. If it is in the fag end of a sign, one is short.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Robson says that the lord of the Ascendant
and Moon without latitude, posited in the end of a sign produce short persons.
Ptolemy mentions that lord of the ascendant with greater latitude causes stout
persons. The greater the latitude the more stout one will be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also, in practice, it will be observed that
the physical description varies from the normal in many respects especially in
twin births. According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, one's height, weight, etc.;
depends on the sign occupied by the lord of the star in which sublord of Lagna
is deposited. The sign denotes the physical feature in general. The
constellation modifies it. The lord of the sub decides whether one is tall or
short, plumpy or wiry and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further one should include the aspects from
other planets to the cusp of the ascendant and judge according to the nature of
the planet. Good aspect from Jupiter to the cusp of Lagna inclines to
overweight whereas Saturn to emaciation. Mars and Sun offer muscular and robust
body. Venus contributes for grace, charm and beauty. Mercury denotes plumpy
with pale appearance. Moon gives prominent features, long nose, piercing and
wandering eyes. Uranus inclines to long limbs. Rahu produces tall people. Ketu
causes shortness. Saturn and Sun contribute for bushy growth of hair. One's
physical feature is governed mainly by the sub lord and the Sign occupied by
the lord of the constellation in which the Sublord is situated. Hindu
astrologers judge the beauty of a person from the lord of the Navamsa Lagna.
The complexion is ascertained from the lord of the Navamsa sign occupied by
Moon. The conduct and character is judged from the lord of Trimsamsa.
Varahamihira advocates this method of judgement. Mahadeva in Jataka Tatva says
that one's appearance will be like that of the planet which is the strongest in
the horoscope: the hue depends on the lord of the Navamsa sign occupied by Moon
and the behaviour and character depends on the Trimsamsa position of Sun.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_2"><span lang="EN-US">Marks_ Scars or Moles on The Body</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mahadeva has mentioned that Mars and Sun
cause red mark; Rahu and Saturn black scar, Moon, Mars and Venus produce on the
head; Venus in Lagna and Rahu in 8 cause a mole in the head or right ear. Mars
in Lagna and Saturn in trine indicate mole or mark in generative system.
Jupiter in 8 produces mole in the belly. Royal mark or mole on the palm or on
the foot will be found in persons who have to enjoy Rajayoga.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Westerners, one will have a
mark or a scar in that part of the body indicated by the sign - (Aries - head;
Taurus - ears, neck, throat; Gemini - arms, hands, shoulders; Cancer - breast,
Leo - heart, sides, back; Virgo - belly; Libra - reins and loins; Scorpio -
secret parts; Sagittarius - hips and thighs; Capricorn - knees; Aquarius - legs
and ankles; Pisces - feet and toes.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) in which Lagna falls</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) in which lord of Lagna is deposited</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) in which Moon is situated</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) in which Saturn, Mars or Uranus are
posited and at the same time afflicted by evil aspects, and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) the sign where the 6th cusp falls.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to me, mole is found from birth
and scars and marks are formed due to disease, cuts, operation, boils, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A male will have a mole on the right side
if the Lagna and lord of Lagna occupy a masculine sign. If the Lagna is
masculine and the lord of Lagna is in feminine sign, the mole in that part of
the body signified by the Lagna sign will be on the right side, whereas the
sign tenanted by lord of Lagna shows the part of the body and the mole will be
on the left side. But if a male member is born in a feminine sign and its lord
is also in a feminine sign the mole will be on the left side. If the lord is in
a masculine sign, the mole will be on the right. For ladies, the reverse is the
order.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If in that sign, the cusp or the lord of
the Ascendant is in the first ten degrees, the mark will be in the upper one
third portion of the part indicated by the sign: if it is in the middle 10
degrees, the mark will be in the centre of that part of the body: if it is
between 20 and 30 degrees, it will be in the lower part of that portion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards scars, one is to note which
planets will cause disease or danger; which sign they occupy and afflict; which
part of the body will be affected; and also judge when it is to happen. For
example, If Venus and Jupiter are in Visaka Nakshathra - constellation 21
degree Libra in the 6th house to Taurus born, one expects appendicitis or
hernia during the conjoined period of Jupiter and Venus. As the surgery is to
be done in the lower abdomen, one is to predict scar in the lower abdomen,
Similarly one is to offer a precise and correct prediction.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_3"><span lang="EN-US">Longevity</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Western system: -</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) By progression, if a malefic comes to
the cusp of any angular house</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) if a malefic forms evil aspect with
Ascendant</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) if a malefic progresses in the 6th
house and afflicts the 4th cusp</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) if a malefic progresses in the 8th
house and adversely aspects 7th cusp</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) if a malefic throws evil aspect from
the 12th house to the meridian</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) if Jupiter, though a benefic, forms
evil aspect with Neptune (MOKSHA)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) if Neptune forms evil aspect with
malefics</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(h) if Uranus, Saturn or Mars receive
strong unfavourable aspect from other evil planets</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) if they afflict the Lord of the
Ascendant or the Ascendant: danger for longevity is to be protended.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So also, during transit, such aspects are
to be taken to fix the exact time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Hindus: the span of life of a
person may be classified into 3 groups.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) short life (0 to 33</span>½<span lang="EN-US"> years)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) middle life (33½ to 66⅔ years)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) long life (66⅔ to 100 years)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Our sages have grouped the following
combinations: -</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_4"><span lang="EN-US">Short Life</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Moon conjoined with a malefic - not
mitigated by the aspect from a benefic and malefic in Lagna and 7th Bhava.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Moon in a Kendra (either in 1 or 4 or 7
or 10) and malefics in other Kendra Sthana.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Weak Moon in 12; evil planets in 8 and
1 - no benefic in Kendra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Benefits in 3 and 8 afflicted by
malefics</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) Moon in Lagna and malefic in 7</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(6) Moon, Sun and Saturn in 8</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(7) Mutual exchange between lords of 1 and
8</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(8) Lord of Lagna in 3 or 6 or 12 -
malefics in 6 or 8 - no favourable aspect from benefits.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(9) Moon, Sun and Mars in 5th house -
devoid of beneficial aspects and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(The above is a general principle. It needs
further consideration. One should not declare hastily the results applying the
above rules alone.)</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_5"><span lang="EN-US">Middle Life</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Saturn in Lagna, Moon in 4, Mars in 7,
Sun in 10, benefits in evil houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Jupiter in Lagna in Sagittarius, Mars
and Node in 8</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Saturn in Lagna, Moon in 8 or 12</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Venus in Lagna, Saturn in Kendra, most
of the other planets in 3 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) Sun in 7, Mars in 5 and Saturn in
Aries.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_6"><span lang="EN-US">Long Life</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) No evil planet in Kendra: Jupiter in a
Kendra position counted from lord of Lagna</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Moon in 9, no evil in 8, benefits in
Kendra</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Benefits in between first and 6th
houses and malefics above horizon</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Leo Lagna - majority of planets in Kona
- Trine houses</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) Cancer or Taurus Lagna: Jupiter
deposited in Lagna. Three more planets exalted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(6) Cancer Lagna occupied by Jupiter. Two
planets in exaltation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(7) Leo Lagna with Jupiter. Venus in Cancer
- Mercury in Virgo malefics in Upachaya Sthana 3 or 6 or 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(8) Moon in Pisces, Sun in Cancer, Aries
Lagna, Saturn in Capricorn, Mars in Libra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus various combinations are given. To my
knowledge there are 284 such rules. Readers cannot remember all these
combinations. Each rule can be applied only to a few births. These are general.
They fail miserably in case of Twins.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But our sages have propounded various
methods to calculate the age of a person. They involve so much of calculations
that a person needs hours and days to arrive at one figure. Those who would
have gone through a few magazines, would be knowing many methods as a symposium
is given. This is the theory. It has confused many to know which one is correct
and follow. God alone has to help the reader. Publishers do not advocate any
one of the various calculations, giving reasons.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following examples and explanations
will be useful. This method is applicable to all births including twins.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Note the correct time of birth and the
time of query</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Erect horoscope using Raphael Ephemeris
and Table of houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Deduct Krishnamurti Ayanamsa</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) Note the Ascendant - Nirayana position
- referring to the table given in the first volume, ascertain the lord of
lagna, the lord of the constellation and the lord of the sub. Dase lord is the
lord of the constellation: Bhukti lord is the lord of the sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If any person has to run the conjoined
periods of these three planets, what would be the result? Will he lead a
healthy life or will he suffer? If the sub belongs to a benefic, he lives long.
When the sub is governed by a malefic, his life is short. This is very clear in
the case of twin births where one lives and the other dies. The sub lord is the
deciding factor.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord is a benefic then it is
necessary to calculate and find the span of life. Lords of 1, 5, 9 and 10 are
benefics. Lords of 6, 8 and 12 are malefics. If lords of 1, 5, 9 and 10 also
rule 5 or 8 or 12 consider the planet as mostly a benefic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The planets owning other houses are
considered as a benefics or a malefic, by noting the other house which they
own. How to judge the longevity is explained with 2 examples. Bhadakasthana,
Kendraadhipathya and Marakasthanas are explained.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_7"><span lang="EN-US">Ex. 1. Chart is as follows</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="547" src="img/image009.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars, lord of Lagna rules the sub of the
Ascendant. Health, vitality, resistance against infectious diseases, immunity,
activity are judged from the strength of the Ascendant, planets in the Lagna
Bhava, those occupying their constellation, the good or bad aspects to the
Ascendant and to the lord of the Ascendant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Benefics in the Ascendant contribute for
long span of life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of the Ascendant forming favourable
aspect with the ascendant and receiving harmonious aspect from benefics
promises long life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ascendant is Scorpio.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Its lord is Mars. As per Hindu System it is
aspecting the Lagna and fortifying it. Therefore health and longevity are
assured by Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Disease is indicated by the 6th Cusp, 6th
house, planets in the constellation of the occupants of the 6th house, the
occupants of the 6th house, the planets in the constellation of lord of 6, the
owner of the 6th house, planets conjoined with them or aspected by them affect
the health and cause such diseases signified by them when they operate their
dasa or bhukti or anthra and there is aspect to them by progression and by
transit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this case (so also for Taurus borns)
lord of 1 is also the lord of the 6th house. So the same planet owns both the
ascendant indicating health and also the 6th house threatening disease. Then
when Mars (lord of 1 and 6) dasa or bhukti or anthra is on, how to say whether
one will maintain robust health or one will fall ill as Mars has to offer
health and cause disease also? Note down which planets form favourable aspects
with Mars and the ascendant and which form (a) adverse aspects with Mars, (b)
good aspect with the 6th house and (c) adverse with ascendant. He will maintain
good health during the dasa or the conjoined period of Mars and the benefic who
form harmonious aspects with the Ascendant and the lord of the Ascendant. He
ought to have fallen ill and he will have ailment during the dasa of the planet
forming evil aspect with Ascendant or good aspect with 6th cusp or lord of 6 or
planet in 6. According to K.P., Significators of 6th house ruling the Sub
period in Mars dasa will cause disease and significators of 11 give cure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8th house is called the house of
"Longevity". Therefore planets in the constellation of evil planets
in the 8th house, except Saturn, occupants of the 8th house, planets in the
Constellation or in the sub of lord of 8, lord of the 8th Cusp and planets in
any manner connected with them indicate (a) danger to one's life (b) the cause
of death and (c) the place of death.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But houses 2 and 7 are Maraka houses and
the 12th house indicates Moksha. The reason is as follows. Houses 1, 8 and 3
are judged for longevity and benefics in these houses contribute for long life.
12th house to any BHAVA is the negation of the Bhava. Therefore the 12th house
to 1, 8 and 3 are 12, 7 and 2 and they are evil for one's longevity. That is
why, houses 2 and 7 are said to be Marakasthanas and 12 is called the Moksha
Sthana. So one is to judge the houses 1, 8 and 3 and then 2, 7 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First of all one is to judge whether a
person is promised "Poorna Ayush </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> i.e., full
course of life running between 66 and 100 or Madyama or Middle life (age
between 33 and 66) or short life between 0 and 33.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then one is to work out, calculate and
ascertain (a) which planet will rule the dasa in that age and the area covered
by the maraka planets; (b) according to progression, the time when the Lagna,
the lord of the Lagna and the very slow moving planets Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune receive evil aspects; (c) according to transit (Gocharæm) when evil
aspects are formed to the ascendant, its lord etc. as per K.P, when
Significators transit in such sensitive points ruled by the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also, erect a chart for the moment at which
there is the urge for one to answer the query and note the evil planets for
that moment. Ruling planets for that moment reveal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Finally ask the person to mention a number
within 249, consider the position of the planets and judge. These are for
confirmation and confidence.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_8"><span lang="EN-US">Bhadhaka Sthana</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to the Hindus, Bhadhaka Sthana
Adhipathis are the worst malefics who will never hesitate to put an end to
one's life. Of the twelve signs, Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn are movable
- chara - signs, and the 11th house counted thereform are Bhadhaka - Sthanas
i.e., to Aries born, Aquarius is the Bhadhakasthana and the lord of Aquarius,
Saturn is the Bhadhakasthana Adhipathi. To Cancer - born, Taurus, is the
Bhadhakasthana and the lord of Taurus, Venus is the Bhadhakasthana Adhipathi.
Similarly to Libra, the sign Leo and the Luminary Sun and to Capricorn, the
sign Scorpio and its lord, Mars are Bhadhakasthanas and Bhadhakasthana
adhipathis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For people born in fixed signs Taurus, Leo,
Scorpio and Aquarius, the 9th sign from those houses are Bhadhakasthanas and
their lords are Bhadhakasthana adhipathis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For people born in common signs Gemini,
Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces, the 7th house thereform and the lords of those
houses are Bhadhakasthana and Bhadhakasthana adhipathis.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_9"><span lang="EN-US">How to Judge</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Of all the planets, those which occupy
the constellation of the occupants of the Bhadhaka Sthana are the most evil.
Next, the occupants of Bhadhakasthana; the planets occupying the constellation
of the lord of the Bhadhakasthana, and the lord of that evil sign. The planets
conjoined with them or being aspected by them also acquire unfavourable
effects.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_10"><span lang="EN-US">Kendrasthana</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Next, the Hindus consider Kendra
adhipathyam as harmful. Waxing Moon, unafflicted Mercury, Venus and Jupiter
owning the houses 1, 4, 7 or 10 counted from Lagna are regarded as Kendra
adhipathis and a few astrologers are terribly afraid of them, as they have not
collected materials and studied from the facts and figures.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There are hundreds of people, born in the
years 1909 &amp; 1923, in the Ascendant Virgo with Moon in Hastham star, having
Jupiter in the marakasthana, 2, owning the Kendra houses 4 and 7 who are now
living having enjoyed their lives for 16 years of Jupiter dasa and are now
running Saturn dasa. Therefore to decide one's longevity, taking
Kendraadhipathyam is not correct. Many other methods are to be included.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_11"><span lang="EN-US">Marakasthana</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Next consider the planets in the
constellation of those in Maraka sthanas, the occupants of Maraka sthanas,
those in the constellation of Maraka sthana adhipathis, the lords of Maraka
Sthanas, and those conjoined with or aspected by them. Thus one is to analyse
and judge.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The lagna of the example horoscope is
Vrischika. It is a fixed sign. The 9th house is the Bhadhakasthana. Moon is the
lord of the 9th house. No planet in the Bhadhakasthana. Hence one is to
consider its lord Moon after judging the strength of the planets in the
constellation of Moon i.e., Rohini or Hastham or Sravanam. Only Mars is in
Rohini star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is a Kendradhipathi owning the 7th
house. Venus alone is in Bharani governed by Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But there is a node Rahu in one of the
signs of Venus and Ketu in the sign of Mars. Rahu represents Venus; Kethu
represents Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore Rahu and Kethu are definitely
evil. Tenant is stronger than owner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As purna Ayush is promised by the aspect of
Mars on Lagna, Jupiter's aspect to lord of Lagna etc, and as it is, he is now
running 63 years of age, consider which dasa will prove to be evil. Mercury
dasa, Venus Bhukti from 4 - 6 - 1962 will operate upto 4 - 4 - 1965.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus in the 6th Bhava, in the dasa of lord
of 8 can cause cataract in the eye. It will be developing in this period and in
the bhukti of sun, who is in the constellation of the lord of Lagna Mars, will
give vision with the aid of a surgeon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Later Moon Bhukti will be pleasant which
will be continuously enjoyed during Mars sub period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu Bhukti begins on 7 - 7 - 1968. Rahu is
undoubtedly evil. Dasanatha Mercury, lord of 8, in the constellation of Rahu,
in Mokshasthana, representing Kendradhipathi Venus, is also undesirable. Kethu
in the constellation of Mars is not favourable. Kethu is in the 6th sign, but
in the 5th Bhava, it is said that Kethu in the 5th house conjoined with
Marakasthana - adhipathi will inflict death.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore Budha dasa, Rahu bhukti, Ketu
anthra will be the end.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Budha dasa Rahu bhukti commences on 7 - 7 -
68: Ketu anthra will be between 2 - 1 - 70 and 25 - 2 - 70.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As per transit on 18 - 2 - 70, Saturn will
be in Ketu star Saturn sub and conjoins exactly Kethu (the anthranatha)
opposing Rahu the Bhukti natha.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore longevity upto 18 - 2 - 1970 is
promised. (Actually this native passed away at 7.30 a.m. on 18 - 2 - 70).</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.1_PHYSICAL FEATURES_12"><span lang="EN-US">Example II. Mars Rajayogadhipathi rules the sub.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="554" src="img/image010.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sublord of the Ascendant shows one's
health, vitality, immunity and longevity: Planets, benefic, by lordship,
occupying Lagna, do not guarantee for long span of life so also Malefics to
affect health. Though Cancer-natives are considered to be fragile in their
youth, they pick up health later and lead a healthy life, yet longevity depends
upon the exact position of the Lagna, the sublord and the lord of the
constellation in which the sublord is deposited.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6th house shows disease. Planets occupying
or owning the house are weaker in strength than the planets in the
constellation of the occupants and owner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8th house shows unexpected and minor or
serious incidents affecting one's health and causing anxiety to life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th house threatens with danger,

negation to that house. Hence, houses 1, 8 and 3 are the houses of longevity
whereas house 12, 7 and 2 are the "Maraka Houses".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The planets, in the constellation of the

Bhadhakasthana; next those in the constellation of the lords of the

house to Cancer is the Bhadhaka Sthana, i.e., Taurus. Neptune alone is in
Taurus. As Neptune is not allotted any star, no planet is in the constellation
of the planet in Bhadhaka Sthana.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is the lord of the sign Taurus.
Bharani, Poorvapalguni and Poorvashada are ruled by Venus. No planet occupies
the constellation of Venus. So Venus itself is a significator. It is in the
constellation of Rahu which occupies Maraka Sthana. Therefore Venus is a very
strong evil planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Leo is the 2nd house, and its Lord is Sun.
it is the Maraka Sthanadhipathi to Cancer-borns. No planet is found in the
second house. Rahu is in Sun's star. Sun is in the constellation of Saturn.
Saturn is Maraka Sthana-adhipathi. Sun is another significator. Capricorn is
the 7th house, another Maraka Sthana. Its lord is Saturn. It is in its own
constellation. Therefore it is evil.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn's stars are Pushya, Anuradha and
Utharattadi (Uthrapathrapada). Majority of the planets are under the sway of
Saturn. Ketu is in Pushyam star. But all the planets in Scorpio, i.e. Sun,
Mars, Mercury, Saturn and the Uranus are in Anuradha star. None is in
Uthrapathrapada. When the majority of the planets are in the same star find out
in which sub according to Krishnamurti Padhhati they are. Those planets in the
star of Saturn and the sub of the other significators for death, are definitely
EVILS. Mars is the strongest malefic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) as it is in its own sigh;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) as it occupies the constellation of
