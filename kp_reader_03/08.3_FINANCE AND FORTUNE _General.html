    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. According to Westerners the fortune of a
            male is judged from (a) the strength of Moon (b) its position (c) the aspects
            received by Moon and (d) the applying aspect of Moon immediately after birth.
            For ladies, one is to consider the above in relation to Sun.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Planets owning and occupying the house 2
            and 10.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Harmonious aspect between Sun and Moon:
            advantageous disposition of Jupiter and Venus in the Ascendant or in elevation:
            beneficial aspect from any planet to the second cusp; favourable aspect to
            Fortune in a beneficial house are promising factors for one to make fortune.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Evil aspects to the Meridian and to the
            lord of the Ascendant threaten difficulties and throw obstacles in inheriting
            the patrimony.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Benefics by nature, occupying the
            houses, 1, 4, 7 or 10, evil planets in 3 or 6 or 12 promises and if none is
            afflicted one can have a pleasant and prosperous life.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. If slow moving planets form mutual
            favourable aspects and the luminaries also are strong and receive harmonious
            aspects, smooth and successful career throughout life is assured.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. Planets close to second cusp with
            beneficial aspects from other, make one rich, planets close to meridian
            receiving good aspects improve one's status and luck.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. Strong planets in the 8th house promise
            legacy, inheritance and sudden windfall.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9. Benefics in movable signs give sudden
            and substantial wealth; if they are in fixed signs, the income is steady; but
            if they are in common signs, it is difficult to hoard up money.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury increases liquid cash, share
            certificates and documents, Jupiter indicates all varieties of property;
            palacial building, gold etc. Venus offers jewels, vehicles, furniture, garden;
            Saturn shows landed property; mine and antiques; Mars gives land and building;
            Sun for authority, power and gold; Moon for liquid cash and wet lands.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10. Uranus or Neptune in 5 gives the
            tendency to speculate, Good aspect to lord of 1, 2 and 11 promise unexpected
            gains by betting, race etc.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11. Fortuna causes fortune through the
            source indicated by the house occupied by it. The lord of the sign containing
            Fortune will make one rich if it receives beneficial aspect.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12. Note which planets forms favourable
            aspect with Fortuna. One becomes rich, through the matters signified by those
            planets. Uranus gives high position, covetable posts, honour etc. Also one may
            float big companies or follow novel and uncommon enterprises. If Neptune forms
            good aspect with Fortuna one will deal in big trade, smuggling, cheating,
            fraud, deception, swindling etc.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">13. Pearce says that planets rising before
            Sun and setting after Moon promise one's income.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">14. Planets above the horizon, strong by
            sign give determination and opportunity to come to the front of the public, be
            popular and be prosperous.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">15. If Saturn or Jupiter rule the 8th house
            and if there is good aspect with Uranus, they produce gifts, legacies; if they
            rule the 4th or 10th house, they give inheritance (to majority of people
            nowadays, it can be taken as provident Fund; Gratuity, Compulsory savings etc.)</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">16. If Moon aspects adversely Mars or
            Saturn or Uranus in the second house, there will always be the financial
            trouble, endless and life long. Jupiter and Moon in adverse aspect threatens
            loss by imprudence and over liberal actions; Mars makes one extravagant and
            impulsive; though one may earn more and more, yet one will spend away
            everything.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Hindus, one becomes rich or
            poor depending on the various Rajayogas and Avayogas propounded by them. In
            practice it is not at all true in all cases. For example Hindus declare that
            one born with Gajakesari yoga or Lakshmi yoga will be popular, prosperous and
            rich. A few rich people may have this combination. But majority of the people,
            suffer from penury difficulties and lead an obscure life. These rajayogas are
            pleasant combinations for a few Traditional astrologers to encourage the consultant
            by giving false hopes and not appraising him of its advantages, the extent to
            which it can help and when. A cook has both Chandramangala yoga and Gajakesari
            yoga. They exist in his chart from his birth time. He could not study due to
            financial trouble; lost what little property he had; he took up this profession
            in a tea-stall; slowly he qualified himself to be a cook. His grievance is that
            he is a cook in a labour canteen and these yogas have not helped him to be at
            least a cook in any officers mess or quarters whereby he can gain some
            influence. If one studies these hundreds of yogas and applies practically, one
            will endorse as follows.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Existence of Rajayoga in a horoscope is
            not a guarantee that one will enjoy one's life. It is not universally
            applicable; it fails miserably and hence it is meaningless.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. There are people rolling in wealth,
            holding responsible position without any yoga-as is said by Hindus;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. It is not clearly stated by the authors,
            when such a yoga will be fruitful and how long: the extent to which it can give
            a lift; how far it is capable of mitigating other afflictions; can it
            completely ward off other evils; when one considers the horoscope of Lord Rama,
            one finds many yogas. Can such yogas get him separated from wife, be passing
            anxious time, have irregular food, taking those which are available, etc? If a
            soothsayer were to meet him, prior to the time when Hanuman was introduced, and
            if the soothsayer were to narrate all the Rajayogas in His Horoscope, what will
            be the reply of the person to whom the horoscope belongs?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Bombay, I met an industrialist. He pays
            lakhs and lakhs as income tax and saves equally. In his horoscope there are 3
            debilitated planets and no Rajayoga. When I came out of his room his clerk
            showed his horoscope. Four planets are found in yogas. Look at his fate? He
            asks the astrologer to recommend to his officer for a petty increment. If both
            the horoscopes are given to some one, following these Rajayogas, he will
            promote the clerk as the proprietor of the Industry and revert the proprietor
            as the clerk. Let me not write volumes on this Unscientific method of examining
            a horoscope.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following is the general method
            followed by Hindus to ascertain whether one can earn and save or lose and
            suffer: -</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. One commands money if the second house
            is strong; If lord of 2 is exalted; or if is in a Kendra or Kona; but if it is
            weak, afflicted and ill posited one loses money, prestige and position;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Lord of 2 conjoined with or aspected by
            Jupiter, Mercury or Venus, makes one rich or intelligent orator or popular
            wealthy person;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Mutual exchange between the lords of 1,
            2 and 11.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Lords of 2 and 9 in a Kendra;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Lords of 9 and 10 in any manner
            connected with each other;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Lords of 2, 6 and 11 in a Kendra or a
            Kona;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. Lords of 2, 10 and 11 in similar
            position;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. Jupiter and Venus in angle, lord of 2 in
            Gopuramsha or Simhasanamsa; or</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9. Benefics in 3 or 6 or 10 or 11 counted
            from Moon sign make one rich;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10. 4 planets in their own quarters make
            the person wealthy;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11. Conjunction of Moon and Mars produces
            rich person;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12. If the owner of the Navamsa sign
            occupied by the lord of the 10th house, is in Vaiseshikamsa, and if it is
            aspected by benefics one becomes rich;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">13. If benefics are posited in all the four
            angular houses, one amasses wealth;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">14. Mercury in cancer and Saturn in 11 make
            one very rich;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">15. Sun in 5 in Leo, Jupiter in Aquarius
            make one rich.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, says, Mahadeva in Jataka Tatva. How
            general it is? How can such rules apply to all. Between 17th August and 17th
            September every year Sun will be in Leo. Once in 12 years, Jupiter will be in
            Aquarius. So, in that year, in this period of one month, both in the poor and
            the pleasant family many children will be born. Do they all become rich? Not at
            all. Not everybody. That is why, I stop here from giving further rules and
            dicta which are too general and not be helpful to the readers.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Krishnamurthi Padhdhati, one
            is to judge one's finance and fortune as follows:-</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Planets posited in the constellation of
            the occupants in the houses 2, 6, 10 or 11 are the strongest to give wealth to
            a person. These planets may be debilitated or may be in enemy's house. Still
            one's status will improve in their periods and sub-periods, if they are in the
            sub of the Significators of 2 or 6 or 11.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The planets tenanted in the above said
            houses and occupying the sub of the singificators of 2, 6 or 11. These planets
            should not be afflicted by the lord of the constellations in which they are.
            They indicated increase in income and savings.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The planets in the constellation of the
            lords of the houses 2 or 6 or 10 or 11 and is in the Sub of Significators of 2,
            6. or 11.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) The lords of these houses in the Sub of
            the significators of 2, 6 or 11.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) Those which are conjoined with the
            significators or aspected by them.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Planets contribute to one's riches:-</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Provided the sub occupied by them are
            governed by the Significators of 2 or 6 or 11.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Provided they are not adversely
            aspected.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord is evil, one loses or one
            is unable to make money during the conjoined period of the planet and the
            sublord. The planet adversely aspecting, robs away the beneficial result during
            their conjoined periods.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further, majority of planets either posited
            in the constellation of lord of 8 or 12 or in their subs in other
            constellations, threaten loss and poverty. They also indicate issue of cheques
            to repay loan or give away the share of profit.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a planet owns 8 and 11, or 12 or 11
            houses, then one can expect beneficial results during its period, in the sub
            period of other benefics being the Significactiors of 2, 6 and 11; in the sub
            period of evil planets one will lose. The ownership of an evil house and that
            of a favorable one by the same planet does not cancel one another and becomes
            neutral, but actually one will gain during its period, in the sub period of
            benefic and one will incur loss during other sub periods. Ultimately the profit
            and loss may be adjusted and the balance sheet may show 'NIL'. Yet there should
            be both the entries in the ledger; pleasure and profit as well as pain and
            loss.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One is fortunate, if majority of planets
            are strong, occupy beneficial constellation in movable sign and are in angular
            houses. Also the mutual aspects should be hornonious.</span></p>

            Sun and Venus, he will be fortunate. (Actually he took up service only in Sun
            Dasa, Venus Bhukti).</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury rules the second house. Its stars
            are Ashlesha, Jyeshta and Revathi. Sun alone was in Ashlesha star. Sun in
            Cancer, in the 12th house in Mercury's star, indicates that he will have
            security of service, permanency, mostly service under Government in a place,
            far away from his native place. It is in a movable sign. Therefore there will
            be change in the department and in the nature of work during the periods and
            sub periods of Sun, from one institution to another. He will be transferred
            with lien in the previous department or completely severing connection with the
            previous job. Also, Sun indicates that it will end his educational career and

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During Sun Dasa, Venus Bhukti, Jupiter
            Anthra in the end of December 1941, when Sun transited in Poorvashada star

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun also causes changes: on 1-5-1942 during

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again during Moon Dasa, Mars Bhukti, Sun

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During Moon Dasa, Sun Bhukti he was

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus Sun had been uniformly doing good in

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again, when he will run Rahu Dasa, Sun
            Bhukti, Jupiter Anthra, in the middle of March 1974, he can expect a higher

            status.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take the 6th house. As Leo is the
            ascendant, 6th house is Capricorn. Its lord is Saturn. Pushyam, Anuradha and
            Utharapadrapadha are the three stars governed by Saturn. Mercury is the only
            planet occupying Pushya. Hence Mercury indicates that</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) he will be inspecting the accounts
            submitted by others or carrying out the instructions of other officials;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) he may have to serve in international
            trade or foreign exchange or in exports and imports.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn, as lord of 6, in the ascendant in
            the sign owned by Sun, in the constellation of lord of 10 Venus, and in the sub
            of Rahu who is an agent of Venus, indicates that he will be holding a position
            of trust and that he has to keep secrets. He will work in a department where
            the official matters are to be kept in strict confidence and should not be
            disclosed. Therefore, during the period of Saturn, he will be entrusted with
            such a work. He may be asked to unearth some facts which were unaccounted, but
            possessed by the parties. As Saturn was in the constellation of Venus, lord of
            10, he will be crowned with success. Not only will he be able to do the job
            most satisfactorily, but it will also be recognised and he will have an
            outstanding confidential report during Saturn's sub periods. When he was
            running Rahu dasa, Jupiter bhukti, Saturn anthra in May 1962, he came to this
            department. Saturn Bhukti commenced on 13-6-1964. Thereafter, he had been doing
            such a work and it is sure that he will be establishing a good name.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(Generally 10th house is termed as
            Karmasthana: it includes doing the last rites to father and mother, to do
            religious functions, yagnas, etc., and to work and make money. That is why,
            those who enjoy promotion during the period of lord of 10, also lose either of
            the elders. 10th house is the second to the 9th (denoting father) and the
            seventh to the 4th (indicating mother) 2 and 7 are Maraka Sthanas. Hence death
            of either of the parents and promotion in services come together. It is worthy
            to note that his father passed away immediately after Saturn Bhukti started, as
            it was in the constellation of lord of 10. Since 9th house indicates father,
            and birth was in Leo, Aries is the 9th house and Saturn is the Bhadhaka
            Sthanadhipathi to Aries. Hence, Saturn affected the longevity of father, on
            27-6-'64 on Saturday in Uthrashada star when Moon transited in Saturn's sign
            and in the constellation of the chief governor for father-Sun. Also Saturn
            transited in Sathabhisha star in Saturn's sign and Rahu's star. When one is
            running Rahu dasa Saturn bhukti, one will realise those results which are
            indicated by the planets in birth-chart, when they transit in the star of Rahu
            in Saturn's sign, i.e., Sathabhisha. This is an important ruling of the editor.
            (If the Bhukti is ruled by Mercury, the significator is to transit in Mercury's
            sign and Rahu's star Arudhra. If the sub period is ruled by Venus, the
            significators have to transit in Rahu's star Swathi in Venus sign-Libra.)</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 10th house is Taurus. It is ruled by
            Venus. No planet occupies Taurus. Therefore consider Venus and planets
            occupying Venus star-Bharani, Poorvapalguni and Poorvashada are the three stars
            under the reign of Venus.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon and Ketu are in the star Bharani;
            Saturn is in Poorvapalguni. No planet in Poorvashada star. Hence Saturn, Moon
            and Ketu are under the sway of Venus and whatever Venus is to offer, would be
            given during the periods of Moon, Ketu and Saturn.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon indicates changes, transfers and life
            in a far-off place. Ketu shows a thorough change. Saturn offers responsible
            position.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus owns two houses, Taurus and Libra.
            Taurus is the 10th house. As Venus owns it, find out whether Rahu or Ketu
            occupies either Taurus or Libra. Then the node is stronger than Venus. As Rahu
            was in Libra, at the time of birth, Rahu will prove to be fortunate. Actually,
            he had a good lift on 15th July, 1959, when Rahu Dasa, Rahu Bhukti, Rahu Anthra
            was operating; Swathi was the Nakshathra on that day.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter, the chief governor for finance, is
            conjoined with Venus. So Jupiter will be favourable. As it was in Ketu's star
            Makam and Ketu was in the 9th house, during Jupiter sub period, he was
            transferred to the north-east. Actually he was transferred to the
            administrative head office, in a town north-east of the place where he was, and
            became popular. The officials, the colleagues and all those with whom he came
            in contact, speak highly of his straightforward, honest and fair dealings.
            Integrity and sincerity stand to his credit. Thus it will be seen that:</span></p>
