<body><h2 id="heading_08.20_HEALTH AND HEART_0"><span lang="EN-US">HEALTH AND HEART</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Heart means the organ of the body which
receives both the pure and impure blood and circulates throughout the body to
carry the food and to bring back the waste in the system. It is both a sump
well getting filled with pure and wholesome/liquid and cesspool receiving the
deoxidised blood. Also it is the pumping set. Heart means affection also.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.20_HEALTH AND HEART_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hindu system</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mr. Podumanai Chomadri in Jatakadesa marga
refers to each part of the body and advises which part we have to judge to note
the disease or defect of an organ.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Divide each sign into three equal parts so
that each extends to 10 dec.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Always count from the Lagna sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First decanate: i.e. first ten degrees
indicate from the Lagna sign 1. Head; 2. Right eye; 3. Right ear; 4. Right
nostril; 5. Right cheek; 6. Right jaw; 7. Mouth; 8. Left jaw; 9. Left cheek;
10. Left nostril; 11. Left ear; 12. Left eye.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second decanate: i.e. 10th to 20 degree in
each sign counted from the Lagna sign. 1. Neck; 2. Right shoulder; 3. Right
arm; 4. Right portion of body; 5. Right side of heart; 6. Right side of the
chest; 7. Navel portion; 8. Left chest; 9. Left side of the heart; 10. Left
side of the body; 11. Left arm; 12. Left shoulder.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Third decanate: i.e. when counted from the
lagna sign in each sign 20 degrees to 30 degrees represent in order, Pelvis,
generative system, Right testicle, Right thigh, Right knee, Right leg calf
muscle, both the legs, left calf muscle, left patella, left thigh, left
testicle and at last the Anus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The above is the same given by Sri
Ramadayalu in Sankedanidhi; in Chapter 4. Slokas 124 and 125.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kalidas in Uttarakalamritha says that Moon
denotes Heart whereas Sun and Mars denote blood.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Prithuyasa in Horasara states that Moon in
Aquarius will cause heart disease and also that when it is in Aquarius at birth
and when its dasa is running one will develop heart disease.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mantraeswara in Paladeepika says that Rahu
causes the palpitation of the heart. He says that the character of one's heart,
meaning affection, etc., is to be judged from Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus there are various statements and
before one takes a decision to follow any, his next birth will approach.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All westerners are of the same opinion that
the 5th house represents heart and Sun indicates heart. Other planets connected
with Sun and afflicting Sun denotes the various types of the disease.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mr. Parimal Purkayastha in his book
"Indian Astrology and Diseases" appears to have a compromise. He says
"Heart diseases are disordered action of heart </span>……<span lang="EN-US">
Karkataka rasi is the sea of heart in natural zodiac. Fourth house governs the
same. Moon is Karaka for heart and sun rules the heart diseases." He adds
"So the affliction of Sun, Moon, Mars, Karkat rasi, fourth house, lord of
4th house etc., and any relation to any of them with 6th house, lord of the 6th
house, Kanya rasi or with disease inflicting house or planet, give rise to the
disease of the heart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What does Krishnamurti Padhdhati say?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Lagna shows health. It does not mean
that it guarantees good health. It depends on the sub-lord of the Ascendant.
i.e., If the sub-lord of the Ascendant is in the constellation of the
significator of 6 or 8 or 12 then one suffers from disease or faces danger or
is hospitalised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. 6th house indicates disease. It affects
one's health.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. 8th house threatens danger.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. 12th house is for hospitalisation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of the 6th indicate disease
in their conjoined periods or sub-periods.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this chart given below the Lagna is in
25 deg. 6 minutes in Leo. It is in Venus constellation and Mercury sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="523" src="img/image042.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What does Mercury indicate and what he will
give in his time. He is the significator of the houses 12, 1, 2 and 11. Hence
Mercury shows that one will be in bed as it is the significator of 12 and since
it is in Leo due to heart disease. As it is Mercury, it may be
neuro-circulatory Asthenia or nervous disease of the heart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn aspecting Mercury denotes that it
will be a chronic one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sixth house is unoccupied. It is owned by
Saturn and Saturn alone is in its constellation. During its period there will
be difficulty in the pulmonary system.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8th house is occupied by Moon and Ketu.
Sun, Moon and Mars are all in Ketu star and no planet is in Moon's star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th house is occupied by Sun and Mars and
owned by Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore this native is to run according
to his chart dasas of Venus, Sun, Moon and Mars. All these are to cause disease
and danger.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.20_HEALTH AND HEART_2"><span lang="EN-US">Cure any_ When_ What Treatment</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cure is to be seen from the 5th and the
11th houses. Jupiter, Mercury (5th &amp; 11th house owner respectively) and
Venus conjoined with Jupiter alone can cause the cure and it will be during
Venus Dasa, Mercury Bhukti, Jupiter Anthra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It will be in July 1976 when Sun transits
in Punarvasu in the 11th house. Sun, Mars and Mercury in the same sign indicate
that he will be cured by a surgeon (Sun Dhanvantry; Mars Surgery).</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.19_ON BLINDNESS.html">← ON BLINDNESS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.20_HEALTH AND HEART">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.21_WILL STAMMERING DISAPPEAR.html">WILL STAMMERING DISAPPEAR →</a></div></body>
