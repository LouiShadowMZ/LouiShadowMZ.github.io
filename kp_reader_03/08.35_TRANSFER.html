May, 1968.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For transfer we have to consider houses 3,
9 and 12th. Therefore for husband</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s transfer, consider
houses 3, 9 and 12 from 7th house, i.e. 9th, 3rd and 6th.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9th house: It is vacant. Lord of 9th is
Mars. No planet in any of the three stars of Mars. So take Mars. But Rahu is
conjoined with Mars. So take Rahu and Ketu in the constellation Sathabisha of
Rahu. Therefore Rahu and Ketu are significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3rd house: It is vacant. Lord of 3rd is
Venus. Mars is in Venus star. We have already discussed Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6th house: It is vacant. Lord of 6th is
Saturn. No planet in any of the three stars of Saturn. Take Saturn. Saturn</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign is occupied by Ketu who is aspected by Saturn and in the sub
of Saturn. Therefore take Ketu and Rahu, Moon and Mercury are in Magha ruled by
Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Planet showing transfer are Rahu, Ketu,
Saturn, Moon and Mercury. As Moon and Mercury are conjoined with Rahu, reject
them and take Rahu. Therefore, Rahu, Saturn and Ketu are very strong
significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun Dasa (Sun is with Venus in the same
sign) and Saturn Bhukti is on. Select Rahu Anthra and Ketu Shookshma. Ketu
Anthra cannot be taken as Ketu is in Saturn</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign and
aspected by Saturn, a planet of delay.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="379" src="img/image064.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu Anthra operates from 23rd January 1969
to 14th March 1969. Ketu Shookshma rules between 23rd Feb. 1969 to 27th
February, 1969. Look at Sun</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s transit. Sun enters
Saturn</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign Rahu star. Select Ketu sub, i.e. on 27
February, 1969. Sun will be in Saturn</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign, Rahu
star, Ketu sub. Moon will be in Mercury</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign Rahu
star. Mars in Mar</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign, Saturn star. Saturn will
travel in Mercury star, Saturn sub. Rahu will transit in Saturn star. So he
will be transferred on 27th February 1969. As Rahu operating as Anthra lord, is
conjoined with Mars, lord of 9th house which happens to be 3rd from 7th
(husband</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s) he will be transferred to a place not far
off. A short travel is shown.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For promotion take houses 2, 6, 10 and 11
from 7th house i.e., 8th, 12th, 4th and 5th from lagna of the lady.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8th house: It is vacant, Lord of 8th is
Jupiter. Jupiter and Venus are in Punarvasu ruled by Jupiter. Jupiter is in its
own sub and so gains strength. Take Jupiter and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th house: Occupied by Sun. No planet in
Sun</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star. Sun in Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
sub. So take Sun: Sun</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s sign is occupied by Rahu: Take
Rahu and Ketu in Rahu star: Rahu and Ketu, Sun are significators;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4th house: Owned by Mars. We have already
discussed Mars;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5th house: Owned by Jupiter; We have
discussed Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So significators are Jupiter, Venus, Rahu,
Ketu, Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun Dasa Saturn Bhukti is going on. Saturn
Bhukti lord is in constellation Rohini ruled by Moon owner of 12th house. So
Saturn Bhukti will give promotion. We would have selected Jupiter</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Anthra as Jupiter in its own constellation and sub and aspecting
5th bhava. But Rahu a node is transiting in Pisces a sign ruled by Jupiter and
hence whatever Jupiter has to give Rahu will give in his period. Therefore the
period of transfer and promotion coincides and he will be promoted at the same
time. As Rahu is in lagna, i.e. 7th house from 7th his immediate boss will be
helping him in transfer</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.35_TRANSFER_4"><span lang="EN-US">EXAMPLE - 2</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Horoscope is given in the next Page.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Budha Dasa Balance 16 years 2 months 9
days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon Dasa started on 18-12-68.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For transfer judge houses 3, 9 and 12 which
includes change of residence also. They should be connected with house 6 or 10.
If connected with 11th house, it shows increase in income and improvement in
status.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="514" src="img/image065.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Third house is vacant. It is owned by
Saturn; Pushya, Anuradha and Uthrapadra are governed by Saturn</span>—<span lang="EN-US">Rahu is in Anuradha.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ninth house is occupied by Jupiter, Mars,
Saturn and Venus. No planet is in Jupiter star. Mercury is in Mars star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is in Saturn star; Saturn and Venus
are in Venus star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is in 12. No planet is in Rahu star.
Rahu is the strongest.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When majority of planets denote a
particular matter, how to eliminate many and select those which will act. A
matter may be indicated by any number of planets. That particular affair may be
one which repeats now and then in one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s life, just like
birth of child, purchase of jewel, transfer, change of residence, journeys,
etc. Then the significators at the moment of judgement clearly shows the
immediate next repetition of the matter. In one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s life
birth and death alone happen only once. Other affairs repeat themselves
according to one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s horoscope.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Today it is Tuesday, ruled by Mars. Lagna
is in Cancer, owned by Moon, Star is Poorvapadra governed by Jupiter in whose
sign, at the time of judgment, Rahu is deposited who represents Jupiter. Rasi
is owned by Saturn. Hence Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter and Saturn are the
significators. Lord of lagna is the strongest and his dasa is on. Lord of star
represented by Rahu. So take Rahu Bhukti. Next select Jupiter, lord of the
star, i.e., Jupiter Anthra, Saturn Shookshma is the last sub sub period (that
it will be around 17th August, 1970.)</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.34_PHOTOGRAPHY.html">← PHOTOGRAPHY</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.35_TRANSFER">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.36_TERMINATION OF SERVICE.html">TERMINATION OF SERVICE →</a></div></body>
