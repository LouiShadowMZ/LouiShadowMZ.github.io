<body><h2 id="heading_08.11_MOTHER_0"><span lang="EN-US">MOTHER</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For people born during day time, Sun
represents the father and Venus indicates the mother; but for those born during
night time Saturn governs the father and Moon rules the mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Hindus the 4th house denotes
mother; but Westerners say that the 10th house represents mother. But if one
consider the ruling planets of one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s mother and the
significators of 4th house, one will find that they invariably agree; whereas
if one finds the significators of the 10th house and judges the ruling planets
of one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s mother, it fails. Hence one is to take the 4th
house alone as that which indicates mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The longevity, health, finance, etc. are to
be judged, taking the 4th house as the Ascendant of the mother and how, each
aspect is considered to the native by counting from Lagna, so also it should be
done for the mother, from the 4th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The beneficial aspect to the 4th house and
Moon promises her health and longevity whereas evil aspect to them will tell
upon her ill health.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Bhadhakasthana, Kendhradipatya, and
Makarasthanas from the 4th house indicate the evil planets affecting her
longevity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Houses 2, 10 and 11 counted from the 4th
house i.e. 5, 1 and 2 counted from the Lagna of the native indicate her
possessions income, pleasure and profit; 6th from the 4th i.e., 9th house shows
her disease, debts and difficulty. Thus results to mother are judged taking 4th
house as her Lagna. The position of the planets are to be counted from the 4th.
The dasa, Bhukti, and anthra ever remain the same.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.11_MOTHER_1"><span lang="EN-US">Mother abandons her child if</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Moon in 7 is in trine to Mars and
Saturn and is devoid of beneficial aspect from Jupiter. This applies to such
children who are left in nursing home or who are taken away from mother and
brought up by other relatives.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) If Mars and Saturn are conjoined
together and if Moon is in 5 or 7 or 9 to them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) If Sun is similarly posited.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Moon in Lagna, Mars in 7 and another
malefic afflicting Moon threatens that mother abandons the child-which dies
later.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) Moon in the second house and Mars as
well as Saturn in 11 offers above results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) If benefics aspect, then good relative
as is indicated by the benefic takes away the child from mother; Malefics
forming good aspect shows, bad people take away the child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) The mother dies along with the child,
if Moon is hemmed in between malefics, occupies 1st or 7th house and 8th house
and is not aspected by benefics.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(h) Saturn in cancer is unfavourable to
mother's health and longevity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) Moon, in Leo indicates that one will
ever be obedient to his mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(j) Moon conjoined with Mars shows that one
will disobey his mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(k) Moon in the tenth house indicates gains
through mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(l) Saturn in 2, Jupiter in 1 and Rahu in
3, is danger to mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(m) Saturn in Taurus, Rahu in Gemini, Venus
in Virgo and Mars in Leo, is danger to mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(n) Saturn in 10, aspected by Moon in 4
will prove destructive to mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(o) Malefic in 11 and Venus and Moon in 5
shows that the mother will be unhappy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(p) Moon in 4, strong and full, Venus in 7
and Mercury in 10 show that one will have happiness through mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(q) One derives the qualities of mother if
Moon is stronger than Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(r) Lord of 12 in 2 or 4 shows unhappy
mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(s) Saturn in 12 is danger to mother.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.11_MOTHER_2"><span lang="EN-US">HINDU</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(t) The fateful degrees of Moon from Aries
to Pisces are as follows: 26, 12, 13, 25, 24, 11, 26, 14, 13, 25, 5 and 12. If
Moon is in the fateful degree, conjoined with malefics, devoid of beneficial
aspect, or if it is in 8 or in a Kendra position, both mother and child will
die together.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.11_MOTHER_3"><span lang="EN-US">K.P.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the 4th Cusp and Moon occupy the
constellation of the Significators of the 9th, 11th, or 3rd house, and if the
sub belongs to Bhadhakasthanadhipati or Marakasthanadhipati, to the 4th house,
the mother will be unhealthy and unhappy; she will not live long after the
birth of the child. Death of mother and her longevity is to be ascertained
taking the 4th cusps as the Lagna of mother and confirm from her chart, if
available.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.10_BROTHERS AND SISTERS.html">← BROTHERS AND SISTERS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.11_MOTHER">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.12_HOUSE TO DWELL IN.html">HOUSE TO DWELL IN →</a></div></body>
