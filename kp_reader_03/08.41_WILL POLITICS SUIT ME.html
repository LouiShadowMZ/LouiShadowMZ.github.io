politics wants to know if he would be successful in political ventures. The
number furnished by him for analysis is 206.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The question is taken up for analysis at
Lat. 16</span>°<span lang="EN-US">31' N and Long. 80</span>°<span lang="EN-US">39'
E on 13-9-1969, 8.30 A.M. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since the querist has given number 206, the
nirayana horary ascendant is the commencement of 206th sub of Krishnamurti
Padhdhati. Hence the lagna is Capricorn 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">6'40".
Adding 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' being Krishnamurti ayanamsa for 1969, we
find that the sayana ascendant is Aquarius 19</span>°<span lang="EN-US">26'40".
The other cusps are obtained from Raphael's Table of Houses as usual. The
values given by Raphael are tropical. But, we work with sidereal (nirayana)
values. Hence, from each of the sayana cusps, we must deduct Krishnamurti
ayanamsa (23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' for 1969). The following chart shows
the different cusps and planetary positions at the moment of analysis.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.41_WILL POLITICS SUIT ME_1"><span lang="EN-US">Nirayana Horary Chart</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="550" src="img/image073.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Balance of Moon Dasa: 8 years; 6 months 5

successful politician are:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) He must be a good orator,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) He must be able to tactfully win over
masses by meticulously placing before them facts and figures and explaining in
detail,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) He must win public confidence;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) He should have an element of fortune to
bless him with popularity and prosperity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Well-placed Jupiter, Mercury and Mars give
oratory capabilities and Saturn gives positions of trust.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For politics, the most auspicious houses
are 1, 6, 9, 10 and 11. Why?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Winning over rivals is indicated by house 6
because it is the 12th to 7th (the rivals).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Popularity and prosperity are to be read
from houses 10 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">An element of fortune and benefits are
shown in houses 1 and 9.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, if Jupiter, Mercury, Mars and
Saturn are strong and signify houses 1, 6, 9, 10 and 11, either jointly or
independently, then the querist will be a successful politician.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the present chart, Jupiter and Mercury
are in conjunction, Jupiter owns 11 and Mercury owns 6. Both are in the
constellation of Moon, lord of 7 in 8. This indicates victory of opponents.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 10 Mars is in 11 and in the star of
Ketu who is in 7. This shows popularity that gains.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 1, Saturn is in the star and sub of
Venus, who owns 9 and is in 6. By this, the querist will win over his rivals by
luck and will be benefitted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 9, Venus is in the star of Mercury
in 6 and sub of Rahu in 1 indicating gains to opponents.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We therefore find that Mars and Saturn are
well placed for politics, Jupiter and Mercury, though apparently well placed,
do not promise success.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn signifies 1 (by lordship), 3 (by
occupation), 6 and 9 (by position in Venus's star, who owns 9 and is in 6). So,
houses 1, 6 and 9 are brought out by Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars signifies 10 (by lordship), 11 (by
occupation), 7 (by occupation of Ketu's star), 6 and 9 (by a position in the
star of Venus, who owns 9 and is in 6).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, Mars signifies houses 6, 9, 10 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars and Saturn will bless the querist with
success in politics. He can, therefore, go ahead confidently. But look! What is
the dasa now running? It is Moon Dasa, Rahu Bhukti. Moon Dasa runs upto 18th
March, 1978. Therefore, the querist should not be in haste. He should wait till
that date in 1981.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whenever Mars and Saturn offer a result, it
will be at a time when Sun transits Anuradha or Dhanishta star.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.40_POLITICS.html">← POLITICS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.41_WILL POLITICS SUIT ME">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.42_WILL I BE SELECTED AS A MINISTER.html">WILL I BE SELECTED AS A MINISTER →</a></div></body>
