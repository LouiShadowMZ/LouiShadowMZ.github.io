note which planets occupy the tenth house. One can acquire wealth through
father, if Sun is in the 10th house. Moon in 10 indicates wealth through
mother: Mars shows that which he gains through foe.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly Mercury through friend. Jupiter
through brother; Venus through wife; Saturn through servants.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Find out the lords of the 10th house
counted from Lagna, Moon and Sun. judge the strongest of the lords. Note in
which navamsa sign, the strongest of the lords of the 10th house is counted
from Lagna, Sun or Moon. Then find out who rules the Navamsa sign. This lord is
the indicator of the profession."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But Bhattotpala is of opinion that one
should not make a selection among the lords of the 10th house counted from
Lagna, Sun and Moon and among the occupants of the 10th house counted from
Lagna and Moon sign. All must be taken for consideration. Sage Garga holds this
view and Bhattotpala supports this.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the navamsa sign is owned by</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Sun: medicine, wool, grass, water,
grain, gold, pearls, respectable post under the government including ministers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Moon: dealing in things derived from
water, agriculture, earth, indulging in controversial matters, apparel etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Mars: metallurgy, war, robber, using
fire, daring action etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Mercury: arts, poetry, astrology, vedas

cattle, jaggery, cooked rice, salt, curdled milk, female, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) Saturn: woodcutter; carpenter,
servants, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Beneficial planets owning the Navamsa sign
occupied by the lord of the 10th house in the Navamsa chart shows that the
person will be beneficial to others. He will have authority. But malefic
planets owning the Navamsa sign, indicates that the person is evil minded or a
hard task - master and he has to serve another.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the tenth house from Moon is occupied by</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Sun: the person is successful in his
enterprises.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Mars: he will be wicked and rash.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Mercury: he will be learned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Jupiter: he will be royal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) Venus: he will be voluptuous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) Saturn: he will be pessimistic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun in conjunction with Mars</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He will be addicted to wine and women.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun in conjunction with Mercury</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrology, valuable articles obtained from
liquids, ladies and jewels.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun in conjunction with Jupiter</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Respected by Government.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun in conjunction with Venus</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Favour from Government, wife with good
wealth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun in conjunction with Saturn</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He will be depressed and dejected.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars in conjunction with Mercury</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He will be a scientist.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars in conjunction with Jupiter</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He will dominate over others.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars in conjunction with Venus</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Foreign trade.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars in conjunction with Saturn</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Bold action.

cosmetics, will practise medicine and do business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Mars and lord of the 4th house are in 1,
4, 5, 7, 9, 10 or 11th house and if the lord of the tenth house is conjoined
with or aspected by, Venus and Moon, the person will have cattle and will
attend to agriculture.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, an idea is given by Vaidyanatha
Dikshita in Jataka Parijata.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us refer Mantraeswara's Phala Deepika.
He also advocates to note the lord of the navamsa occupied by the strongest of
the planets owning the 10th house counted from Lagna, Moon and Sun. if the lord
were to be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun: Fruit trees, Mantras, by fraudulent
action or by gambling, by speaking untruth, dealing in wool, medicine, metals,
Government service or service under some noble person.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon: Business, pearls, corals,
agriculture, cattle, farming, pilgrimage, serving a damsel, textiles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars: Metals, Military service, cooking,
agriculture, gold, troubling or black - Mailing others, weapons, bold actions,
wicket company, spy, theif.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury: poet, reader, clerk, magician,
astrologer, vedanthi, priest etc,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter: Favour from good people,
Government service, reciting mantras and Puranas, studying sastras, money -
lending, Law.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus: Women, cows, buffaloes, elephants,
horse, dance, silver, scents, silk, milk, jewels, Aid de - Camp, Kavi.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn: fruits, labour, serving with low
morality, bad grains, cooly, dirty jobs, sculpture, carpenter, butcher, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Place of acquiring wealth is indicated
by the sign representing the tenth house or the navamsa sign occupied by the
ruler of the 10th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A person can make money in his own place if
the 10th sign is occupied by its owner or at least aspected by him. If the lord
of the 10th rasi occupies in Navamsa, a fixed sign he earns in his own place.
If this navamsa sign receives aspect from planets other than the owner, the
native will earn money in a foreign place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If we take a twin birth, we find one looks
after agriculture and remains in the village, whereas the other roams about and
like a rolling stone does a variety of service and never stays in one place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Take another twin birth were the Lagna, the
position of Sun and Moon should be the same for both. The lord of the 10th
house would also be the same. The Navamsa sign occupied by it would also be the
same. Yet, one is a very famous medical practitioner remaining in his own
residence and making money, whereas the other twin brother is an advocate, an
orator, a vice chancellor, an educationist and an industrialist moving from one
place to another and earning in all places which he visits and wherever he
stays.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take another twins birth at Delhi.
One is a Government official and the other is a speculative businessman.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose the parents of the twins show both
the horoscopes, how will you predict:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) in which college-medical, engineering,
arts or technical, they will get admission?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) which profession they will have?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mind you, there is no choice for the
individual. Planets portray. They promise whatever they presage. That alone
will happen. When one is doubtful because he himself is not sure of anything,
one may offer advice and say that he may study medicine. But if the boy is
keen; he may join engineering; if he does not like either, put him in arts
college. But if you follow the principles propounded by Krishnamurti, you can
predict only that which is to happen. Elimination is easy. Fixation is simple.
Rules are very clear. Result is correct. No laborious calculation for days is
needed on one horoscope. It is after all a matter of a few minutes.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.27_PROFESSION_2"><span lang="EN-US">Krishnamurti Padhdhati</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let me state very very briefly the
combinations etc., to fix a profession. It will give the readers an idea about
the method.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Study what each sign indicates e.g.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Aries: Police, Defence, Military, Industry,
Land Brick kiln, Soldiers, Surgeons, Chemists, those who deal in metals, iron,
steel, etc., butchers, barbers, cooks, those who use sharp instruments, etc.,
(These details are available to the student in the first Reader).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Understand what each planet denotes, as
for instance </span>–</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter: Law, administration, religion,
finance, education, physician, judge, political career, production, expansion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus: Music, art, paint, poet, actor,
union, flower, scent, silk, milk, embroidery, fancy articles, costly ones,
jewels, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn: Land, property, mine, coal, lead,
jail, cremation, burial ground, digger, watchman, cooly, etc. (The details are
available to the students in the first Reader).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Now combine the Rasi and the planet.
Aries-Mesha is ruled by Mars. In it there are 2 </span>¼<span lang="EN-US">
stars. First is Aswini, ruled by Ketu. The second is Bharani governed by Venus.
The third is Karthikai, lord of which is Sun. Hence, according to Krishnamurti
Padhdhati suppose the meridian falls between 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> 40</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> and 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 53</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> then this area is in the sign Aries
owned by Mars, in the star Bharani governed by Venus and the sub ruled by
Jupiter. Therefore Mars, Venus and Jupiter indicate his profession. Suppose one
is born with the meridian between 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 53</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> and 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 0</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Aries, then Mars rules the sign, Venus the star and Saturn the
sub. To note the position of meridian and the lords of the sign, star and sub
will not take even a minute. You can invariably find that people working in
Animal Husbandry or as a Judge will have some connection between Mars, Venus
and Jupiter. Why? Venus and Mars indicate kama and strength and will to unite.
Jupiter is the chief governor for progeny. So he will have something to do with
Animal Husbandry or work as a veterinary doctor also. Mars indicates authority
and power; Jupiter, law and Venus, assessment, Judgement, balancing the merits
and demerits of the case. So he can be a Judge. But if the meridian is in the
sub of Saturn, Mars-Venus-Saturn show that he works in a slaughter house or
deals in skins and hides or manufactures shoes, etc., Why? Mars and Venus
indicate </span>“<span lang="EN-US">animals</span>”<span lang="EN-US">. Saturn is
called </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">yama</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> the chief
governor for slaughter. So he may work in a slaughter-house. Or Venus is for </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Thejas</span>’<span lang="EN-US">-skin (beauty), Saturn denotes the
dead, Mars shows industry; an industry dealing in skins and hides.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence every point in the zodiac indicates a
profession. 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in Mesha-Aries shows Animal Husbandry.
22 in Mesha-Aries indicates slaughter house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When a twin is born, having their meridian
in this manner it may appear funny when one is told that one of the twins would
breed cattle while the other destroy them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Consider well! For both, the Lagna is the
same. The positions of planets etc., do not change in the interval of 5 minutes
between the time of birth of one child and the other. But look at the results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">After fixing the meridian, consider in
which position the significator of profession is. Suppose Sun is in 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Aries, then he serves in a place where there is security of service
as Sun is to give a steady life; it indicates maximum labour and minimum wages.
He may be a Veterinary Surgeon, If Moon is in 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
Aries, then the light of Moon is modified by Mars, Venus and Jupiter. Therefore
he may be a captain of a ship, as Moon indicates ocean, Venus the vehicle,
Mars, to handle with authority and power, Jupiter to manage and administer. Or
one who supplies water to animals. If Mercury is in 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US">,
Aries, the combination is Mercury, Mars, Venus and Jupiter, when he may be a
building contractor, Sanitary Engineer or an Accountant or Clerk in Animal
Husbandary or a Law Court-Selection of any of these depends on the strength of
a planet. Thus one is to take into consideration.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Which planet signifies one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s profession;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) in which sign, star and sub it is;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) with which planet it is conjoined; or</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) by which planet it is aspected.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Above all, note the dasa and Bhukti
running.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Never miss to find the position of the Dasa
lord and Bhukti lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A person may be a teacher to start with,
during Jupiter Bhukti. Then he may be a legal adviser in a company dealing with
labour during Saturn, Mercury and Ketu, sub periods. Later he can be taken as a
Public Prosecutor in Venus sub period. Therefore, the sub periods indicate the
changes and one should be careful while passing a judgement.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further one should apply the mind and
select the correct profession. As Aries represents the profession of a surgeon,
a barber, butcher etc. can any one be merely following the tradition, simply
repeat and recite the Sloka? Every one should know that a barber removes the
hair (indicated by Saturn) bring back beauty (by Venus) using sharp instrument
(Mars). A butcher is to kill (Saturn stronger than Venus) an animal (Venus)
using a sharp instrument (Mars). A surgeon who is allowed to cut open the body,
is expected not to kill the patient, but try to end his troubles and not his
life. So a Surgeon should have Sun (for medical-Dhanvantry), and Mars (to use a
sharp instrument). Therefore the area of Sun in Aswini star or Bharani star and
Karthik star in Aries indicates surgeons. The sub of Saturn in Aswini or
Bharani indicates butcher. The sub of Venus denotes a barber. See, how clear
and convincing it is.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.27_PROFESSION_3"><span lang="EN-US">PROFESSION _Combination of planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The nature of profession has to be judged
by taking into consideration, the strongest significator which promises entry
into service or indicate independent business or adding something more to the
existing business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Extensive research has been conducted by
the intelligent students of the Modern Astrological Research Institute, Madras
and it has been found possible for us to lay down certain grouping or

on 19th March 1937 at 6.14 P.M. at Madras:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="597" src="img/image052.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="576" src="img/image053.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He is a surgeon practising in Bombay.
Normally, when one tries to find out the profession of a person, he has to note
(1) the planet occupying the 10th house and also the lord of the 10th house (2)
the Navamsa signs occupied by them, (3) the lords of the Navamsa signs in which
the occupant of the 10th house and the lord of the 10th house were, and (4)
judge the profession signified by the lords of the Navamsa signs occupied by
the occupant of the 10th house and the lord of the 10th house. This is the principle
which is being generally followed but requiring correction by the application
of Krishnamurti Padhdhati.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to K.P method </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> (a) one should note where exactly the meridian falls: (b) the lord
of the sign the star and sub. Also take into account the planet very close to
the meridian. The profession is indicated by the combination of these planets
and the dasa lord in progress.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Applying Krishnamurti Padhdhati, the
meridian in Gemini 5 degrees, means that the sign is ruled by Mercury, the star
by Mars and sub by Sun. Therefore his main profession will be indicated by
Mercury, Mars and Sun. sun and Mercury give him the intelligence, quick
understanding, grasp and because both of them were in a watery sign, correct
intuition is indicated. One of the main occupations indicated by Sun is
medicine. Mars is for Surgery and Mercury for quick action and also correct
diagnosis. Hence from the position of the meridian, one can say that he is a
Surgeon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The other alternative would be that Mars
and Mercury indicate mechanical engineering, and Sun for service in the
Government.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also one can predict that he may be serving
in a Government Press, as Sun indicates Government, Mercury paper as
communication and Mars Machinery. Thus a few avocations may be indicated by the
combination of the lord of the sign, star and sub, where he had his meridian
(10th Bhava). By applying Krishnamurti Padhdhati one can minimise the
alternatives and determine the exact nature as disclosed by Sub lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10th house is occupied by Moon. Moon
governs the stars Rohini, Hastham and Sravanam. No planet is found occupying
any of the three stars. Therefore, Moon must be taken as one of the
significators of profession. Consider what Moon can do. It is in the constellation
of Mars and aspected by Mars and Jupiter (both are in their own signs and
strong). Therefore, Moon is to offer the results of Mars and Jupiter. Mars and
Scorpio suggest chemical or medical and Jupiter in Sun's constellation suggests
medical. Mars in the constellation of Saturn and in Scorpio indicates that he
will carry out post-mortem also as Saturn denotes the dead. Hence, the occupant
Moon also promises that he will be Surgeon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if we were to apply the general
principle, the lord of the 10th house is Mercury. It occupies Cancer in Navamsa
which is owned by Moon. Moon is posited in the 10th house and it is in Scorpio
Navamsa. Therefore, the lords of Cancer and Scorpio (Moon and Mars) indicate
the profession. Normally, one cannot expect Medical profession for the
combination of Moon and Mars as the rule is to find the lord of the navamsa
sign and read out the profession in the traditional way.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.27_PROFESSION_6"><span lang="EN-US">LENGTH OF SERVICE</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us examine the following chart to
determine the length of service.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="606" src="img/image054.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the above horoscope, it will be seen
that the second house extends from 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">56</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Cancer to 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US">56</span>′<span lang="EN-US">
in Leo and the second house is owned by Moon. The sixth Cusp commences from 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US">56</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Sagittarius and extends up to 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in Capricorn and the 6th house is governed by Jupiter. The
Meridian, i.e., the Cusp of the 10th house falls at 27</span>°<span lang="EN-US">56</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Pisces, extends all the 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> of Aries and
ends at 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US">56</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Taurus and the
lord of the tenth house is Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">No planet occupies any of the three houses
2, 6 or 10. Hence there is no need to note the constellation ruled by the
occupants and also the planets occupying those constellations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore take the planets in the
constellation of the lords of 2, 6 or 10. Moon rules the second house. Jupiter
governs 6 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon's stars are Rohini, Hastha and
Sravana. Moon and Jupiter alone occupy Hastha.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The stars of Jupiter are Punarvasu, Visaka
and Poorvapathra. There is no planet in any of the three stars. Therefore, Moon
and Jupiter are the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Nodes are stronger than the planets. Hence
find out whether Rahu or Ketu occupies their houses or conjoin with them or
receive aspects from either Moon or Jupiter. Then, they also will be the
significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu is in Cancer in Moon's sign. So Ketu
is stronger than Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu receives the beneficial 5th aspect
from Jupiter. Hence Rahu acquires the strength of Jupiter, other than what it
has to offer, as an agent of Saturn, by occupying Capricorn owned by Saturn and
also by receiving aspect (3rd) from Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon and Jupiter, the significators, are in
the third house, in a common sign showing that you will be having a
transferable post.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon and Jupiter indicate Departments of
Finance, Education or Politics. The third house does not show Education.
Generally the fifth house indicates Politics. Third house occupied by Moon and
Jupiter in Mercury's sign indicate short tour, transfer, inspection of
accounts, auditing etc. Further, the Meridian was in Jupiter's sign, Mercury
star, and Saturn sub. It is clear that the native will be a journalist,
correspondent or working in the department of Finance.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When was the first appointment?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Find out the dasa that runs between the age
of 16 and 30 to all persons, as, generally people enter service only then.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This native was running Rahu Dasa from the
age of 13 years 2 months and 26 days, till 31 years, 2 months and 26 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is found that Rahu and Ketu are the
strongest significators. Hence the native ought to have entered service during
Rahu Dasa, Ketu Bhukti, Ketu Anthra, or Rahu Anthra on the day when Moon was
transiting in one of the 3 stars governed by Rahu, viz., Arudhra, Swathi and
Sathabhisa. Actually the native joined the Finance Department during Rahu Dasa,
Ketu Bhukti, Ketu Anthra on Swathi star day. Viz., 6-9-1921.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When he was running Jupiter Dasa, Saturn
Bhukti, Mercury Anthra, he was selected and from Ketu Anthra promoted in 1932.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For 9 months during the Bhukti ruled by
Ketu in Jupiter Dasa, the native had a transfer with an additional allowance in
1936.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again during Jupiter Dasa, Venus Bhukti,
Ketu Anthra the native was offered a special duty in the Central Board. During
Jupiter Dasa, Sun Bhukti, Ketu Anthra, he was posted to a far off place. In
1955, the native retired once for all during Saturn Dasa, Sun Bhukti. In Saturn
Dasa, Moon Bhukti, Ketu Anthra he set up practice.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What next?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This native was running Mercury Dasa from
16-2-64. Mercury Bhukti ended on 13-7-66 when the very favourable Ketu Bhukti
started. Popular and prosperous Venus Bhukti followed Ketu's period for 34
months from 10-7-67. Only from 10-5-70 Sun Bhukti commences. It is Sun which
will give the native the mind to take rest and give up private practice.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.26_CHANGE IN JOB_ 9TH HOUSE EXPLAINS.html">← CHANGE IN JOB_ 9TH HOUSE EXPLAINS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.27_PROFESSION">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.28_BUSINESS.html">BUSINESS →</a></div></body>
