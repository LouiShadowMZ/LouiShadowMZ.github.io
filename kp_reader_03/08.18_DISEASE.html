<body><h2 id="heading_08.18_DISEASE_0"><span lang="EN-US">DISEASE</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Various books written by western authors
are referred, especially, "The message of the stars" written by Max
Heindel and Augusta Foss Heindel, published by L N Fowler &amp; Co, Lilly's
Astrology Zadkiel, Sepahriel, Llewlyn George, Alan Leo, etc. How the
information collected there in, is to be made use of while applying
Krishnamurti Padhdhati is given below:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He says</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Never tell a patient a discouraging fact</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Never tell him when impending crisis are
due</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Never predict sickness at a certain time</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Never, never predict death”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He adds that it is a grave mistake, almost
a crime to tell sick persons anything discouraging, for it robs them of
strength that should be husbanded with, the utmost care to facilitate recovery.
He is of opinion that it is a well-known fact that many students of the medical
colleges, feel the symptoms of every disease they study and suffer greatly in
consequence of auto-suggestion, but the ideas of impending disease implanted by
one in whom the victim has faith is much more dangerous. Therefore it behooves the
medical astrologer to be very cautious. If you cannot say any thing
encouraging, be silent.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Planets: Which part of the body and disease
do they indicate?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun: Governs the vital fluid in the body,
the heart, the pons varolii, etc. Radiant health is given by Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon: Rules the stomach, the uterus, the
ovaris, the lymphatics, the sympathetic nervous system, the synovial fluid. It
indicates whether one can have menstrual troubles, uterine and ovarian
afflictions, dyspepsia, eye trouble, lunacy, and diseases connected with
breast.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars: governs the red bone - marrow,
haemoglobin, red blood corpuscles which carry food to various parts of the body
and help in throwing out the waste. It also governs the genitals. Accidents,
burns, gunshot injuries, surgery, are shown by Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury: Pulmonary system, respiratory
diseases, motor segment of the spinal cord, vocal cord, locomotor functions,
ataxia, nervous disorders, deafness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter: Liver, glycogen, adrenals,
arterial circulation, fatty degeneration of the muscles, tumours, cancer,
morbid growths, enlargement of organs, waste of sugar, albumin in the urine,
blood poisoning, apoplexy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus: Throat, kidneys, lack of exercise,
sedentary habits. poor circulation of blood, tonsillitis, venereal diseases.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn: Obstrution, atrophy, gall bladder,
bones, painful rheumatism, teeth, mottled enamel, fluoride intoxication, stiff
bone, dullness in the peristaltic action thereby poor digestion bruises, colds,
chronic diseases, fear complex, never believes that he will be cured. Always
pessimistic, fracture.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus what each planet denotes is given. So,
one is to note which planet will cause the disease, in which sign it is, and in
which sign the lord of the constellation of the planet, which is the
significator of both the first and the sixth houses is. Considering all these,
one has to come to a decision and then predict the nature of the disease from
which one will suffer; then calculating the period when the significators of
one and six operate, one is to give the time when one will fall ill. Similarly
one has to note down when the eleventh house significators will operate. If the
11th house significator is also the significator of the fifth house, one will
surely have the cure for the disease from which one suffers. Unless the sub sub
period of the significator of the 11th house operates, following the period of
the disease, immediate cure is denied, and one is to wait till the significator
of the 5th and 11th begin to operate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Nature of the diseases: The ascendant and
the significators of the ascendant will indicate whether one can maintain good
health or suffer from any disease or will have rapid or slow recovery from the
ailment or succumb to it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sixth house denotes the upset of the
health, the disease from which one will suffer, its nature and duration of the
disease. It is not necessary that one should suffer from any one variety of the
disease in his lifetime whenever he falls ill. The nature changes according to
the significator of the disease and the period running. Normally there will be
a few significators of the sixth house. All cannot cause diseases unless the
same significator of the sixth house is also significator of the first house.
6th house indicates not only disease but also debts, difficulties, separation
from the partner, etc. Hence to definitely predict that one will suffer from
some disease, one should note whether the significator of sixth house is also
connected with the ascendant. If it is connected with the second and not the
first, then it indicates either entering into service or borrowing money. If it
is connected with the second and also the 12th, it shows that he would have
lost what he borrowed or repaid the loan already taken, etc. But if the
significator of the sixth house is also the significator of 1 and also 12 one
will be confined to bed or isolated, i.e. hospitalised</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The fatal disease is shown by the
significator of the 8th house. One may suffer from various diseases during his
life time. But that which would be the last disease from which one suffer, is
indicated by the sub-lord of the 8th cusp. Twins may be born. The lagna and
also the 8th cusp may be in the same sign and star for both of them. But the
nature of the death differs. How? Which can explain the reason for this, except
the sub-lord of the 8th? One of them meet with accident. The other passes away
on another date after suffering from some other disease. The only method by
which one can decide is only by judging the sub-lord of the 8th cusp as the
cusps alone change within the few minutes interval in their birth time.
Therefore one should note the nature of the diseases as explained below.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note the sub-lord of the 6th cusp. This
need correct moment of birth. If it is not available, then if you want to know
the sub of the sixth, you take the ruling planets at the moment when you have
the urge to put the query. Mysteriously God will help you by eliminating the
previous and the next sub to the one which you have to select.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now a gentleman has entered my room in
Delhi. His question is whether there will be any relief from the disease from
which he is suffering. To day it is Saturday. The constellation in which Moon
is transiting is Poorvashada, governed by Venus in the sign Sagittarius, owned
by Jupiter. This shows that the body gets emaciated due to passing away off
sugar in the urine. Hence I decided that it should be diabetes. When I asked
the gentlemen whether he suffers from diabetes, he said 'yes'. His horoscope
also indicated the same disease. It is as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="554" src="img/image040.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now let us see the 6th cusp of the native.
It is in Venus sign, Moon star and Venus sub. Combination of Venus, Moon is
judged for profession as one who deals in milk, petrol or syrup. Hence for
disease we have to take that he passes not urine but syrup-like fluid. It
should be clearly stated as diabetes as Moon is connected with the 8th house by
owning it and 8th house shows micturition-passing urine. If I want to note the
sub from the ruling planets it can be seen that it may be Jupiter or Saturn or
Venus sub as today it is Saturday and the star is Poorvashada. The lord of the
star is stronger than the lord of the rasi which is stronger than the lord of
the day. Therefore the divine grace is ever there to fix correctly that which
you want by taking the ruling planets at the moment of judgment. Therefore
whenever you want to find out the disease of a person, note the sub-lord of the
sixth cusp; find out in whose constellation it is deposited. Find out the sign
where the lord of the star was at the moment of birth or at the time of query
and also the sub-lord of the sixth both put together to give the clue.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the above horoscope the sub-lord is
Venus. It is in Scorpio, the 8th sign of the zodiac and in a watery sign
indicating sexual organ and excretion from the body. Venus was in the
constellation of Jupiter in Libra. Libra is for kidney, bladder etc. How clear
it is, is to be judged by the readers themselves. The native of this chart
found out that he had unusual thirst in the night and when he sent his urine to
the clinical laboratory, he found that there was sugar in the urine. Thus every
reader of my magazine or the book should become a capable astrologer who could
diagnose the disease with least effort even without seeing the patient. It is
the chart erected for the moment of judgement which reveals. Where is the
necessity for the patient to visit the chamber of the astrologer. For a medical
officer, he should see patient, hear his case, do all the possible tests and
arrive at a correct diagnosis. For an astrologer it is easy to eliminate many
of the suspected ones and pitch upon the disease correctly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Pathogenic effects of the twelve signs of
