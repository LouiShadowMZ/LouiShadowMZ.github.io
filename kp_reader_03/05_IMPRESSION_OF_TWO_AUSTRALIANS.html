great ability. He is well versed in both occidental and Oriental Astrology.

astrologer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I have read his book. I am greatly
impressed by his simplicity of presentation and clarity in teaching the more
esoteric aspects of Astrology".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(BY) ALLICE,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(Sd) Perth, Australia.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">'My very first impression of Mr

known for many years. He combines religion and astrology and he expresses
himself so simply and very clearly. His books reflect the same simplicity and
understanding.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My best wishes for his work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(BY) HARRIS,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(Sd) H.W. Australia.</span></p>
