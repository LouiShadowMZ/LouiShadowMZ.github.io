have asked the querist to give a number within 249: Why? There are only 2
schools: one to have a number between 1 and 108 and the other to have a number
between 1 and 249. Since the number given is 203, it should be between 1 and
249.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But, if one consultant mentions 203 when he
is asked to give a number within 108, then one need not bother to calculate but
say at once that the answer is negative to the query which he puts: Look at his
worry. Absent mindedness!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Zodiac is divided into 249 divisions as
per Krishnamurti: There are 249 different combinations of sign lord, star lord
and sub lord. Therefore, cach number has a definite combination. One mumber
less or greater given has different combination of planets indicating different
results. Also each number shows the exact position in the Zodiac which is to be
taken as the ascendant 203 means Saturn sign Capricorn, Moon star Sravana, Sun
sub 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40' to 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20'
Nirayana. Latitude in 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 55'.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore we have to take that for this
horary map 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Capricorn is
the ascendant (the beginning of the sub). Add ayanamsa 25 20'. Then Sayana asc.
x-16</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Aquarius. Referring to Table of Houses for this
latitude, it will be seen that second cusp is 22 25 Pisces; third cusp is
27" 25 Aries; by calculation we will obtain that 4th cusp is 26 25 Taurus;
fifth cusp is 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 25 Gemini, and sixth cusp is 17</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 25' Cancer: The other 6 cusps are 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
opposite.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Position of planets for this moment is to
be inserted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is Monday. Time of judgment 11-30 A.M.
on 17-2-69. The horoscope is as follows:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">

</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Research is shown by 9th house and the
success in any walk of life is shown by 11th cusp and the time is to be judged
from the significators: failure and loss or success in a foreign land are to be
understood from 12th (it will be clarified subsequently). Number given shows
that the lagna is in Capricorn 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40</span>′<span lang="EN-US">. For 18.55 latitude 11th cusp is in 29 5 Scorpio. It is Mars sign,
Mercury star and Saturn sub. Neither the lord of the constellation nor the lord
of the sub is in retrograde motion. So one is to judge what the cusp promises
according to the sub lord and the significators. Mercury is in 12th Bhava:
Saturn, the sub lord and Venus, lord of 9 are in Mercury constellation. 12th
house shows failure and loss in the place of residence or fortune and success
in another foreign place. It depends on the lord of constellation in which the
planet in 12 is deposited. If the lord of the constellation of the planet in 12
were to be situated in 1 or 2 or 3 or 6 or 10 or 11, one gains with strangers,
foreigners, in another place, in foreign land, etc. Otherwise, one incurs loss,
wastes time and money.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The constellation lord is Mercury. It shows
that one spends time, money, etc. in a place other than his permanent place. As
Mercury is in the constellation of Sun in lagna bhava it is well spent and
success is promised. Any planet or cusp in Mercury constellation is also
auspicious indicating similar results. Saturn, the sub lord is lord of 1 and 2
in 2nd bhava in Mercury star and own sub. Hence Saturn is also good. Therefore,
11th cusp is under the sway of Mercury and Saturn: They promise luck in a foreign
place: Success in enterprises: fulfilment of one's desire and realisation of
one's ambition.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then note the significators of 11th house.
11th house extends from 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 5' Scorpio to 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 5' Sagittarius. No planet is in this area. Lord of the 11th bhava
is the lord of the sign where 11th cusp has fallen. It is in Scorpio. Hence
Mars is the lord of the 11th house. Sun alone is in Mars star. Therefore Sun
and Mars are the significators of 11th house matters: For research, take 9th
house. 9th cusp falls in Libra. It is owned by Venus and 9th house is occupied
by Mars. We have found that Sun alone is in Mars star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards the owner Venus, no planet is in
Venus star. Hence Venus indicates. In Mars, Sun or Venus sign there is neither
Rahu nor Kethu. But Venus is conjoined with Rahu. So Rahu will give Venus
results. Time of success will be Rahu Dasa Sukra Bhukti Sun Anthra Mars
Shookshma. At the time of judgment Rahu Dasa 7 years 11 months 1 day had
passed. 10 years and 29 days are left over. So, Saturn Bhukti continues till
27-2-69. Then Mercury and Kethu Bhukti must pass, i.e., 3 years 7 months 6 days
and then only successful. Sukra Bhukti comes, i.e., 4 years 2 months from today
i.e., middle of February 1970. During Mercury and Kethu Bhukties research will
go on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu is in Budha's sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2, 5 and 11th houses show child birth 2,
5, 6 and II to gain in speculation.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2, 7 and 11 houses for marriage: 6, 9, 11
and 12, for overseas and higher studies, 6, 9 and 11 scholarship for higher
studies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2, 6, 10, 11 for promotion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2, 4, 11 for house,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2, 4, 11 for car.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6 and 11 pet animals.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2 and 11 help through younger brother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9, 11 to submit thesis or do research and
come out successful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4, 11 for success in education.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6, 11 to win the litigation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6, 11 to be successful in election and so
on. Thus one is to note that the 11th is judged to find out success-In which,
one wants success. According to that query, one is to find out the other house
or houses to be considered,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here 9 and 11 houses promise success and
they also show that it will be in the middle of February 1973. In this query,
the bhukties which are to run before success are those of Mercury and Kethu. As
Kethu is in Mercury's sign it will continue to give what Mercury offers. If Mercury
has not connection with 9 or 11, then he will not do research. Mercury is the
lord of the constellation where 11th cusp is. So his attempts to do research
will be successful in Mercury sub period. As it is in 12, he will do it in a
foreign place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu in Mercury's sign promises
continuity. As dasa lord is connected with Saturn, there will be honest and
sincere attempts. The querist will be plodding, persevering and patiently
working. Thus this will go on till Sukra Bhukti come. During Venus sub period,
one is successful. Mars, lord of 10th cusp also promises name, fame and
reputation.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="14.5_Will I go Overseas.html">← Will I go Overseas</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_14.6_Research and Success">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="14.7_Can I expect a transfer_ when.html">Can I expect a transfer_ when →</a></div></body>
