not scientific. There are two methods:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Ask for a number within 108 and divide
by 12; take the remainder and counting from Aries depending on the reminder, we
fix a sign as lagna. We take the whole sign as lagna bhava, the next sign is
second bhava and so on. Hence the longitude of each bhava will be 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. Only when the number given happens to be 6 or 18 or 30 or 42 or 54
or 66 or 78 or 90 or 102, ascendant Virgo will rise for latitudes 14</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> N, the longitude of each house will
be more or less the same, each being 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. Otherwise,
the longitude of each house must be different.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) We ask for number within 108 and divide
it by 9 count from Aries, as many signs as the quotient is, then the remainder
indicates the Navamsa in the next sign. So the number given by the consultant
gives the navamsa, the longitude of which 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20</span>′<span lang="EN-US">. The house division is not suggested by the author in
Uthrakalamridha. So, one is to take, naturally, 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US">, 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> from that Navamsa or 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> behind and 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in advance according to the Hindu system of house division. The
author has not advocated as to which method is to be followed. But if we follow
cusp to cusp, just like Westerners, then also we have to take 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US">, as the longitude of each house. The longitude of each house will
be 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> only when the number given is 47, and that also,
will be nearing correctness only for 200 years to come as from 1st January,
1970, Ayanamsa is 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>′<span lang="EN-US">; one
may refer to Raphael's Tables of Houses. Then one can find that, for latitudes
14</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> N when Libra 0 rises
in the East, the other cusps are all in 0 in the next, next sign. (The sidereal
time will be 6 hrs. 0 mts. 0 secs.) Therefore only for the latitudes 14 to 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> N, when according to Sayana 0 Libra rises in the East, the houses
will be of 30. Otherwise, the longitude of each must vary.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But in Krishnamurti Padhdhati, the number
indicates the sign, the star and the sub. And the sub commences at a particular
position. This is taken as the ascendant and according to the latitude of the
locality, where the horoscope is judged, taking into account the Ayanamsa on
the day of judgment, the cusps of the other houses are calculated. Therefore,
Krishnamurti Padhdhati is alone scientific, whereas the Hindu system is, in
fact, unscientific.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Regarding Westerners they take the time of
judgment; they crect the horoscope, for that time taking into account, the
latitude of the place of judgment. So, it is very scientific. </span></p><h3 id="heading_04.2_HINDUS-UNSCIENTIFIC KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI-SCIENTIFIC_1"><span lang="EN-US">Number preferred</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But the defect in that system is that
certain questions can never be answered using the horoscope erected for a
particular moment of judgment. Suppose two people come and ask, within an
interval of a few minutes. The horoscope, the aspects between the planets and
the cusps of the houses, the mutual aspects among the planets themselves, will
remain more or less the same, and therefore one has to predict the same result
for both of them. (Time of event and the nature of the result). Supposing A and
B stand for election in the same locality and both of them visit the house of
an astrologer at an interval, of 5 minutes, the astrologer has to necessarily
offer the same prediction to both of them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if the astrologer were to ask for a
number and accordingly he erects the horoscope, certainly </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) the position of the ascendant and the
other cusps of the houses will vary, even though the planets may be in the same
sign, same star, and same sub: </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) the houses occupied by the planets will
vary: </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) the significators will vary and hence
one can correctly predict the diametrically opposite results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, Krishnamurti Padhdhati-Horary
Astrology- is most scientific and most useful for any question, and this gives
precisely the correct answer and also the accurate date of fruition.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="04.1_HORARY ASTROLOGY-KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI ADVANCED STELLAR
