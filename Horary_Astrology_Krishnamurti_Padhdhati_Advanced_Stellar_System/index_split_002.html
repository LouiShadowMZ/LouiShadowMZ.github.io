<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334357">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="block_4">Four decades are over; the fifth is on. Research is being carried upon the births of persons born
		in the same locality with an interval of 10 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. I concentrated the study upon the
		horoscopes of the twin births. I collected data regarding the time of birth of the twins, the various results
		enjoyed by them and the time of such events.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">While carrying out such a research, I found that the general principles enunciated by our
		ancients and also those given out by the scholars of other countries cannot be strictly adhered to and applied
		to one and all; it is evident and clear, especially in twin births, since the rate may come out correct in the
		case of one but fails miserably in that of the other as the result is diametrically opposite. With due respect
		to the learned authors and to the astrologers who strictly follow the principles, many consultants have
		complained to me that there is no coherence, no clarity, whereas confusion and contradiction do exist. They also
		have the same excuse, saying that planets show tendencies. A few twist the rules and astrology is thereby made
		useful only to the astrologers. Therefore, both the students of astrology and the astrologers themselves have to
		honestly confess that there is no simple, correct and convincing method which can be universally applied to one
		and all. This is a fact.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">By the grace of God, I evolved certain methods which are most convincing, very clear and
		pin-pointing to the time of event and explaining the nature of event to the entire satisfaction of the querist
		and the astrologer. It guides properly. So, this method is the best and is very useful to the querists, as the
		prediction comes out correctly; also, it brings name and fame to the astrologer.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore, I am publishing this book on Horary System of Astrology after praying to God that the
		Truth which dawned in my mind, may be well explained, properly illustrated and exhaustively dealt with in a
		lucid manner.</p>
<p class="block_4">R.A.V.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Let us first of all understand both the Hindu and the Western systems </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">ASTROLOGY: HINDU AND WESTERN: </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Some are under the wrong impression that the Westerners borrowed knowledge from the Hindus; some
		others say that the Hindus gained knowledge from the Chaldeans, Hebrews, Greeks and so on. Is the view correct?
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The sages and the scholars in each country gazed at the stars, thousands of years ago, and they
		discovered the relation between the celestial phenomena and the terrestrial incidents </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">They established some methods to fix the position of planets in the Zodiac and the consequem
		effect on the animate and inani- mate objects on the earth. Each followed certain methods to predict the events.
		If one has studied both the systems, one will declare that neither the Hindus borrowed from the Westerners, nor
		vice-versa. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Suppose some students appeared for mathematics examination: copies of the question paper were
		distributed to them. All were busy answering them. The superintendent caught hold of a student called him as one
		who had been copying the answers written by another student, seated in front of him. He took this student and
		complained to the Headmaster that he had been copying in the examination hall. On enquiry, the student
		repeatedly said that he had not copied at all. The headmaster called for the ans er papers of both the students
		and compared them. He declared that the student had not copied at all and the complaint was baseless. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The student, who was accused to have copied, had answered the questions 1.3. 5 and 7 in the
		question paper, whereas the other student had answered questions 2, 4, 6 and 8. Hence, the Headmaster who had
		gone through both the papers alone could know the truth. The superintendent who saw this student writing fast,
		and also, off and on, looking at the other student's table. had mistaken him, because both answered the same
		mathematics paper. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Similarly, only when one studies both the Western and Hindu systems, one will confirm that the
		method followed by either is absolutely different from the other. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">1. Zodiac: For both, the Zodiac is the pathway of the planets. But for the Westerners, the
		commencement of the Zodiac, i.c., Aries 0 retrogades at the rate of roughly 50.2388475 seconds every year,
		whereas for the Hindus, for astrological purposes the Zodiac commences always at a fixed point which is about
		180 from the Star Spica-Chithirai. The Zodiac of the Westerners is called Sayana Zodiac whereas that of the
		Hindus is called Nirayana Zodiac, Therefore, as years pass on, in about 480 years, it will be found that the
		Sign Aries-Mesha called by the Hindus will exactly coincide with Taurus-Rishaba by the Westerners. The portion
		of the Zodiac called by the Hindus as Taurus-Rishaba will be called by Westerners as Gemini-Mithuna and so on.
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">2. Mansions: Westerners have divided the Zodiac into 12 equal parts and call them as Solar
		Mansions or signs. So also, Hindus have divided it into 12 equal parts and call each division as a Rasi. But
		there is the difference in the commencement of the signs as explained above. Therefore, the area covered by the
		signs followed by the Westeners and the Hindus is not the same. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The Hindus have another method of dividing the Zodiac. They have divided it into 27 equal parts
		and call them as Lunar Mansions, Constellations, Asterism. Nakshathras or Stars. The Hindus give greater
		importance to this division. They have found that planets transitting in the same sign but in different
		Nakshthras cause different effects. Just like each rasi (or sign) is said to be ruled by a planet, so also the
		Hindus declare that each star is governed by a particular planet (e.g.) Aries sign (Mesha) is ruled by Mars
		(Sevyai): Taurus Sign (Rishaba) is governed by Venus (Sukra); and so on. This is common to both the Western and
		the Hindus systems. But, after discovering Uranus and Neptune, the Westerners have allotted Aquarius (Kumba) to
		Uranus and Pisces (Meena) to Neptune. The Hindus did not include this allocation. As regards the Nakshathras,
		the first division commencing from Aries (Mesha) 0 is Aswini ruled by Kethu; the second is called Bharani
		governed by Venus; the third star is Karthikai ruled by Sun: the fourth Rohini, lord of which is Moon and so on.
		(It is given in a tabulated form in the text Krishnamurti Padhdhati.) </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">3. Day: The Hindus consider that a day commences only from the moment of the Sunrise in that
		locality and that it extends till the next sunrise in the same locality. The Sun may rise at 4-30 AM or 5 A.M.
		or 7-40 A.M. If a child is born at 7-20 A.M. and the Sun rises only 7-40 A.M. to that locality on that day, then
		the child is said to have been bom on the previous day. Suppose the Sun rises at 4-50 A.M. and a child is born
		at 5-10 A.M. the Hindus consider that it is born on the next day. They take the lord of the next day for
		judgment and predict. This is very important when the Hindus elect certain auspicious day to undertake any
		project. As we follow civil date, date changes at 12 midnight. But for Hindus Sunrise to Sunrise is a day,
		though, date changes at 12 midnight. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">4. Horoscope: While erecting a horoscope and offering prediction the Hindus attach much
		importance to the signs, houses and Navamsa position of the planets. But, the Wester ners attach importance to
		the signs and houses They have no "Navamsa" chart at all. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">5. The Houses, ie. bhavas: Differ widely between Eastern and Western system of calculation.
		Westerners calculate the houses from cusp to cusp, whereas the Hindus take the cusp as the midpoint of the house
		and call the House as Bhava. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">6. Prediction-Ududasa: Vimshothari, Ashtothari, Kalachakra dasa, etc., are the various dasas
		advocated by the Hindu sages to predict events in one's life either to himself or to his relatives or others,
		with whom he or she has or has no transaction at all. The Westerners have no daut system at all </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">7. Progression: There is no clear and exhaustive method of “Progression”given by the Hindu sages
		though it is simply mentioned by only one sage. Westerners follow this method to predict events in one's life
		and have advanced much in Progression. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">8. Transit: Westerners take the position of Sun in the Sayana chart to offer transit results. The
		Sayana position of the transitting planets is referred to the position of Sun at birth. But the Hindus take the
		Nirayana position of the transitting planets and refer to the radical Narayana position of Moon in the
		horoscope. Further, the Hindus give the results according to the Sign occupied by the transitting planets and
		not the Houses (or Bhavas) transitted by them; but the Westerner's take into consideration both the signs and
		the houses transitted by the various planets and the exact longitudinal distance. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">9. Aspects: The Hindus are of opinion that all planets aspect the 7th house whereas Saturn has
		also special glance on the 3rd and 10th houses counted from the sign occupied by it; Jupiter aspects 5th and 9th
		houses from its position: Mar, aspects 4th and 8th houses, counted from the sign it occupieds other than the
		7th. But the aspects followed by the Westerners are calculated correctly. They call that the longtitude between
		one planet and another planet or one planet and the cusp of one house. if divisible by 221, the aspect is
		disharmonius, harmful and adverse. Also, they say "If the longitudinal distance among two plancts. or between
		one planet and the cusp of another house, is divisible by 18 or 30 (except 90° and 150°) is considered to be
		harmonious, favourable and advantageous. "They do not count sign to sign, as Hindus do; but they take the exact
		relative position. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">10. Parents: Westerners consider that the fourth house indicates father and the 10th house the
		mother. But the Hindus take the fourth house as the mother of the person and the 9th house as the father. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">11. Strength: Hindus estimate the strength of the planets by Shadbula, etc., after laborious work
		whereas the method adopted by the Westerners is very simple and they do not have any such calculation. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">12. Ashtaka varga: Is a method followed by the Hindus which is not known to the ancient
		astrologers of the West. This method is useless especially in Twin Birth Charts or to those born to different
		mothers within short interval. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Thus, many instances can be given to show that the Westerners and Hindus follow their own system
		which are absolutely different. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Why both the methods are considered to be incomplete, and the Hindu System is confusing and
		contradicting needs no explanation. But one has to understand. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(1) How to ascertain the favourable and the unfavour able disposition of planets. </p>
<p class="block_4">(2) What nature of results a planet indicates. </p>
<p class="block_4">(3) The exact time when they will be experienced. </p>
<p class="block_4">(4) To predict the different results enjoyed by twins born in the same locality, but with an
		interval of few minutes even though the ascendant (lagna) is in the same sign, the position of planets in the
		Zodiac in the sign and in Navamsa chart remains the same as well as the dasa and bhukti are more or less same.
		As per progression the aspect among the planets will also be similar in the horoscopes of people born within
		short interval </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">So, it would be a problem both For Hindus and Westerners (i) to estimate the longevity of cach,
		as in some cases, either of the twins passes away carly in infancy and the other lives along. (ii) one gets
		married, the other remains unmarried, (iii) one has sterling character whereas the other is always after the
		opposite sex, (iv) one has children, the other has to adopt, (V) one enters Government service, the other takes
		up business; (vi) one is a lawyer, the other is a surgeon, and so on. The common aspects are the same mother,
		father, uncle, aunt, etc. But the number of brothers and sisters will vary in those instances where one of the
		twins is a male and the other a female. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Astrology can be declared a science, only when these differences can be explained properly, at
		least after knowing the results. It will be considered to be a perfect science, if it is made easy and the
		students having the ardent desire, understand it thoroughly, apply it properly and offer correct predictions.
		Herein came the need for research. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">By the Divine Grace, research was successful. Some truths are discovered. Later, after convincing
		my own conscience, from 1951 I began to teach my technique to many students (who are already learned). I am
		happy that God has given me health to tour throughout India and coach up hundreds of students every year.
		Everybody knows that I am the only astrologer doing this service. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Also, a number of astrologers at Junnar, Poona, Kirkee, Kolhapur, Sholapur and Ahmednagar wanted
		me to deliver series of lectures, daily, for 15 days and I did. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">A few came from Bombay to Delhi, stayed for months and attended lectures at Delhi. A few from
		Singapore. Kasipet, Busawal and other places stayed in my residence and learnt. Most of the disciples unlearnt
		what all they learnt prior to my lectures, thoroughly understood my technique. Just like a number of parallel
		mirrors, reflect many images, and the images are seen to infinite distance, so also they make use of Krishna-
		murti Padhdhati, confirmed to be simple and supreme and spread this technique. They have declared that this is
		the best and correct method to foretell and satisfy the consultant as it enables one to offer precise
		predictions, even in the cases of twins born at an interval of only a few minutes. It is convincing, clear and
		very correct, that is what they say. There is no use for the word "Likely, Probably" etc. Tendency is used only
		by those people who cannot offer definite predictions. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If this book is studied, one will say after studying once "Aham Na Pandithaha". A second reading
		will give him courage and confidence to say "Aham Cha Pandithaha". If a third reading is given, people will say
		that the astrologer who had read thrice this book can declare himself "Aham Eva Pandithaha". </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">This book is an eye-opener, It is a corrective one. It does not accept incorrect dicta. The
		expression is lucid; idens are clear; arguments are convincing; the results are correct. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">All these are due to God's Grace whom I bow down again and again. [Uchchista Maha Ganapathi.]</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The authorities of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan realised the truth in my technique. They were fully
		convinced, as many uncanny predictions given during the lecture, came correct and they were happy to hear the
		scientific explanation and to see that it came true. That is why, Governor of Bombay Dr. P. V. Cherian conferred
		the title "Jyothish Marthand" and presented a Gold Medal in a convocation at Bombay to the author. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Next it is my duty to thank those who were helpful to me to improve the knowledge in this
		science, to assist in my research and to bring out this text-book. Let me first thank Kulapati Munshiji &amp; or
		having appointed me as a Visiting Professor of Astrology in India to deliver lectures at Delhi, Bombay and
		Madras regularly and occasionally in other kendhras. Improvement of knowledge is mainly due to the most
		intelligent students (aged between 25 and 65) who would be requiring me to answer varieties of questions, and to
		clarify various doubts left unsolved, so far. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Let me thank Sri K. Ganapathi, my eldest son, working in State Bank, Madras who had assisted me
		in every aspect, deserves appreciation and my heartfelt thanks. So also, I thank Mr. Bala, Delhi, for his
		co-operation and assistance. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Finally, I thank God so that this seience may be developed further by the readers to give
		amazing, astonishing, but accurate prediction. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">My final prayer to God is that this science may be used only to find auspicious time for
		celebration of marriage, admission in schools and colleges, construction of mansions, purchase of car, jewels,
		etc., admission of expectant mother in nursing home, opening account in a bank, etc., that all of us may be so
		happy and prosperous that astrology finds no necessity to offer mental solace, as I pray that everybody should
		be crowned with success. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Peace, Pleasure and Prosperity be to all of us.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">K. S. KRISHNAMURTI.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334358">About the author by various people</h2>
<p class="block_4"><span class="calibre3">(Extract of Introduction at Indo-German Society, Jaipur.) </span></p>
<p class="block_4">President &amp; Learned Members,</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Mr. Krishnamurti has studied thoroughly both the Western and the Hindu system, and he openly
		points out the failures. He has found out a method which is popularly known as Krishnamurti Padhdhati or
		Advanced Stellar Astrology. From the magazine published by him (Astrology and Athrishta), it is clear that
		hundreds of students in big cities throughout India are being educated by Mr. Krishnamurti, and he has
		systematized Astrology in scientific lines. He delivers lectures. So, it has been decided to have a study circle
		so that students and scholars of Astrology can assemble together and exchange their views, and also teach the
		new entrants to this field. The competent members will carry out the research study and students will assist
		them in collecting the data, erecting correct horoscopes, and furnishing full details. Mr. Krishnamurti will put
		us on the right path by frequently visiting Jaipur. Time is ever-changing, nothing is stationary, modern outlook
		and living are absolutely different from the time of our Maharishis. Therefore, we have to render this science
		useful to the present-day conditions, scholarship to go overseas, air travel, varieties of professions,
		education in various subjects, etc. With this view, we have started a branch of his Institute and the study
		circle titled as *Rajasthan Astrological Research Study Circle*, inaugurated by Mr. Krishnamurti. I take this
		opportunity to express our grateful thanks to the president and the Members of Indo-German Society for having
		extended the invitation to Mr. Krishnamurti to deliver the lectures here, whose real and valuable services are
		well recognized by all of us. When Mr. Krishnamurti visited Jaipur previously under the lucky Presidentship of
		Hon'ble Minister Mr. B. N. Joshi and Mr. Rameshwar Prasad Dhumani, they opened a branch and inaugurated this
		study circle at the auspicious time.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334359">ASTROLOGY—AN OCCULT SCIENCE</h2>
<p class="block_4">Astrology is a noble science. It is as old as the age of the Vedas. It depends on the position of
		the planets ascertained astronomically. It explains the celestial phenomena and the corresponding terrestrial
		events. The true meaning of Astrology is the “Message of the Stars.” By using the salient principles of
		Astrology depending on the position of the planets ascertained astronomically, one can forecast events for the
		benefit of all, and as such, it is a useful science for interpreting nature.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Astronomy is excellent but it must come</p>
<p class="block_4">Up into life to have its full value,</p>
<p class="block_4">And not remain there as Globes and Spaces"</p>
<p class="block_4">—Emerson</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The whole world is run according to a well-defined plan. Nothing happens by chance. Astrology
		does not permit one to classify anything as an accident, as it explains the cause and effect of events. The
		divine plan is well-arranged. It is timed with amazing precision.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Some say that astrology is an art. Some others reject it as an idle dream or an illusion. Still,
		others may speak of astrology as though it were an altogether contemptible superstition. They contemplate with
		pity those who believe it. Some of those who have no disappointment or other difficulties in life take pride in
		saying that they have no faith in astrology and ridicule both the astrologer and the science. Probably they may
		fear that they may lose their self-importance if they were to recognize astrology. A few others say, under wrong
		impression or with prejudiced ideas, that astrology is not a science. These people would not have mastered the
		data on which correct predictions are based. This science explains clearly that such opponents of astrology will
		have in their horoscopes evil aspects between Mars and Uranus or between Mars and Mercury. These planets, when
		afflicted, do not give quick grasp of this science, nor memory and reproductive ability, and they produce people
		who are either ignorant, arrogant, envious, or are always inclined to find fault with what they are not able to
		understand.Pretending to know everything, they display their ignorance. The antagonists often quote the opinions
		of such learned men, who do not want to admit that it is a useful science. Learning is the mechanical
		acquirement of facts and gaining knowledge in any subject. But wisdom is not so. Astrology can be correctly
		interpreted only by a genius endowed with divine grace and no one can call himself wise, without knowing
		astrology.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">I submit that astrology is a science and that it can render very useful service to one and all
		and create faith even in the sceptic, if one studies this book. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">A knowledge about the history of astrology and the illustrious and eminent sages and savants who
		practiced astrology would give a better appreciation of the science itself.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334360">HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY</h2>
<p class="block_4">The history of Astrology begins with Creation itself. Sage Garga says that the science was
		propounded by the Creator Himself and that Brahma handed it down to him at the time of creation. From Garga,
		other sages learnt it and it was spread all over. It appears to be co-<span class="calibre3">eval with that of
			the earth. </span></p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In western countries there is a certain belief that Seth (3,769 B.C.) was the world’s first
		astrologer. This can be inferred from the astrological books written later by Arabic, Egyptian, Jewish, and
		Persian writers. Westerners believe that Seth was the first person to study the planets, their motions and their
		pathway. It is he who divided the Zodiac into twelve equal parts, as he found that the Sun ever follows a
		particular path in the Heavens, year after year; and he also noticed that this circular route of the Sun was
		spaced out by twelve full moons. Full Moon occurs once a month. Therefore, the Sun's path is divided into 12
		equal parts called ‘Mazzaroth’ which <span class="calibre3">term we designate as “Signs” or solar mansions.
		</span></p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Around 2,600 years ago, the priests and the shepherds of Chaldea took this science for serious
		study and developed it. Their period was called the Golden Ages of Astrology, because <span class="calibre3">they connected the movements of the planets with all kinds of events in human life. </span>
</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Dr. Thompson says that the Akkadians and the Sumerians observed the heavens and heavenly bodies
		and tried to note their courses. The Babylonians and the Egyptians attributed some influence over the animate
		and the inanimate objects on the earth. Astrology was popular and it wielded great influence over the rich, the
		priests, the princes and the kings. Maspero said, that, in his time, the Mistress of the world was Astrology.
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Some are of the opinion that Astrology had its origin in Chaldea from time immemorial. They
		suggest that the very name Chaldean means ‘Astrologer’. The Pythagoreans further advanced the concepts of the
		Chaldeans. They applied higher mathematics. Later, astrology came into the hands of the Greeks. They
		concentrated more on Natal Astrology, as they had a deep-rooted religious nature and an enquiring mind. They
		always posed the questions: "Who am I? Why am I born? What for do I live? Why are there so much of inequalities
		in life?" They had the answers only through astrology.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Many of the records of the early astrologers of Nineveh and Babylon are found among the early
		tablets in the British <span class="calibre3">Museum, some of their findings are dated nearly 5,000 years ago.
		</span></p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The Greeks were also enthusiastic in following astrology. They erected the horoscope for the time
		of birth and presaged the finance, family, fate, fortune and future of the individuals. One of the Greek
		horoscopes written in Papyrus about 2,000 years ago is kept in the British Museum. The Chaldeans who practiced
		this art of Astrology were held in high esteem even at the time of Alexander the Great.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The Egyptians were equally interested in Astrology, which played an important role. They were
		also responsible for shaping the future of the nation. As can be seen from the monuments, the inscriptions, and
		modern investigations, this science dates back to 5,000 B.C. Pharaohs gave much respect to the astrologers of
		whom Babilus was the leader. He was always consulted and the duty of Babilus was to find out the charts of those
		who might per chance gain power, become a rival and create trouble to the emperor. Whenever Babilus foresaw any
		such native, he informed the king, who put such people to death. Pharaohs had faith in their astrologers. Often
		they were consuIted to interpret the dreams of the king. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In Persia, the kings honoured the astrologers for their sound knowledge of this science. It is
		only Gjamasp otherwise known as "Al Hakim" (meaning Learned), an astrologer in Persian court who precisely
		predicted the time of birth of the prophets.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The Saracens spread the Science in Spain in 711 A.D. and the North Africans, the Moors, in 1,237
		carried the science to Europe</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Dr. Brewster admits that in China about 2,752 B.C. from the days of King Fohi, they developed
		astronomy nobly for studying astrology and emperors were chosen according to the profound knowledge possessed by
		them in astrology. In 2,513 B.C. Cheuni was elected as the King in that manner.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Whenever Alexander the Great went out, he took with him the astronomer Calisthenis in all his
		campaigns. He spread the science in the east by giving out some of the rational methods adopted there and his
		visit to India had helped him to learn more and develop it further in his country.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Henry Cornelius Agrippa, born in 1486, was the astrologer to Francis I of France when he was 38
		years old, John Dee was the favourite astrologer of Queen Elizabeth. Albu Mezar of Bulah was the professor of
		Mundane Astrology at Bagdad. The Caliph Mammonarrasheed translated many ancient astrological works into Arabic
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Thus, every nation is to be credited with the knowledge of this Science. It is advisable to learn
		the experiences and findings of research workers who had contributed to the technique of correct prediction.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Let me mention the names of a few foreigners who have contributed to the development of this
		Science. They were not only scholars in Astrology but were renowned and reputed Astronomers, Historians,
		Philosophers, Physicians and Poets. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Astronomers: Ptolemy (67 A.D.) Galileo Newton Pythagoras Kepler (27-12-1571) Copernicus, </p>
<p class="block_4">Astrologers: Alan Leo (-11-1862) Sepharial Dr. W. J. Llewellyn Hayden George Agrippa (Simmonite
		Max Heindel Carter Parker Morirus Maurice Sibley Wemyss W. Lily Culpeter Boreham Robson Newton.</p>
<p class="block_4">Historians: Diodorus Coley Pabwal Maximus Josephus Plutarch Camden Heroditus</p>
<p class="block_4">Philosophers: Lilly Macrobius Aristote Bacon Thales Pliny Anasagoros Pliny Ptolemy</p>
<p class="block_4">Physicians: Hypocrates Foster John Dee Gilbert Partridge Agrippa Starkey</p>
<p class="block_4">Poets: Hypocrates Foster Galen John Dee Gilbert Partridge Agrippa. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In India, it is said that it was the sage Garga who handed down the Science to his disciples.
		Further there are recorded evidences that Yavanas were very learned astrologers and that they lived many
		centuries before Varahamihira, who admired, in his text-books, the progress made by the Yavanas in this Science.
		Yavanas have contributed much for the development of this Science in India. There are records to show that
		around 3,102 B.C. the Trivalore Tables were used solely for astrological purposes.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The following list furnishes the names of a few renowned Indian Scholars who expounded, explained
		and interpreted this Science: Garga: Viddha Garga: Asita; Aryabhatta; Bhrigu; Brihaspathi Badarayana Baradwaja:
		Bhadalla Devaswami;Devala Dravyavardhana; Garutman Jeevasamon: Kapila; Kanabuk: Kashyappa: Latacharya; Manu;
		Manitha; Maya; Parasara; Panlisa Pitamaha-Romaka; Rishiputa; Sidhasena; Simhacharya Saka; Sapatharishi:
		Saraswatha; Savitra: Satyacharya; Sidhasena; Yavanachara; Varahamihira: Bathothpala: Prithyuyasas; Vaidyanatha
		Dikshithar; and many others.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Thus it can be seen that astrology was held in great esteem in all ages by the leaders in other
		sciences also.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">As years passed by, for various reasons this science, which is to live long, and which will
		surely live long, has lost some of its charms. But science remains ever a science. In every age, a particular
		science alone receives much attention and is developed, even though every science has its own innate value and
		is useful to us. No country had ever passed quiet without any advancement in any branch of science. So in every
		age any one science may be very popular, whereas the other sciences may be ignored, though not totally
		forgotten. It is not unlikely that there are people even now those names would come as a great surprise to all;
		there will be very earnest and loyal student of astrology who will popularise astrology.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">This book is published with the sincere desire that Astrology should be made popular. Much of
		Research is done regularly and systematically. Furthermore it has to be carried out. There should be fool-proof
		methods to read accurate results. Students of astrology with half-baked knowledge should be educated and
		imparted higher knowledge. Their doubts should be cleared. Those who bring ridicule to this noble science should
		be silenced by producing able astrologers who will give correct knowledge to them. It is only with correct and
		clear understanding of the subject one can predict astoundingly accurate results, and establish that the noble
		legacy, astrology, given to us by our forefathers, is indeed a science which is as accurate as any other
		science. The present position of astrology, in the hands of a number of astrologers, is really deplorable, The
		excuse may be that there is no proper education to them and hence the result is unsatisfactory. Even when
		watches are manufactured by the same concern, no two watches agree. If they are manufactured by many, one can
		guess, how they will be. Similarly, astrologers and a few other professionals usually offer different opinions,
		confusing the already depressed consultant. So I suggest that coaching up of students is absolutely necessary to
		have the same school of thought. To say that it is not a fit subject cannot be said as a wise statement from the
		astrologers point of view.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In many other countries, astrology is included in the curriculum. It is understood that, in
		American University, Astrology is included. Also, there are schools of Astrology in Germany, Switzerland,
		Holland and France. Now in India in Jaipur astrology is included. KULAPATIJI Dr. MUNSHI is conducting course on
		Astrology in Delhi and Madras where I coach up students and in Bombay where learned scholars with vast
		experience teach. Scientific circles there, give serious attention to it. Astrologers are to-day thankful to the
		Astrological Research Association of New York which publish quarterly (Editor Charles Jayne), and all Research
		Scholars are allowed to contribute their articles. At present in India, Astrology is like a T. B. patient left
		uncared for, especially by those who alone can cure. It is handled by a few. Of them, some are avaricious, some
		others have commercialised it by fortune-telling without the desire to maintain the prestige and utility of
		astrology. Some alone sacrifice everything for this noble- science. The rash and worthless predictions of a few
		astrologers have debased astrology and these are received with sarcastic smile only to be dismissed.</p>
<h3 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334361">Nadis</h3>
<p class="block_4">Some people feel sorry that they consulted "Nadis" written on palmyra leaves claimed to be
		written by the ancient Rishis of India. It is a fact that the events in the lives of many persons born and yet
		to be born are found written already by Hindu genius. People who have consulted add that they are dumbfounded
		with the surprisingly accurate predictions about the past events, but feel upset when the future events fail
		miserably. This is a common complaint. Thousands of years ago, Rishis wrote these wonderful predictions. When
		they can be very correct in all the predictions from the time of birth of the native till the date of
		consultation, why they should fail in their future predictions cannot be explained. I also agree with those who
		say that this needs proper investigation because there are large number of genuine Nadis and it is likely that a
		few may be unauthentic ones. The solution can be found easily if the palm leaves are handed over to the
		consultants, by the owners, who hold the leaves and read out the results, as if from them. I am confident that
		if the palm leaves are given to the qureist and if the reading of the past and present should agree correctly.
		the future must also be invariably correct when alone the Nadi can claim to be one of the genuine documents. Our
		sages who had written Nadis can never fail in their predictions and they have never failed, because of their
		intuitive power and scientific knowledge. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">It is likely that a few readers of the palm leaves gain enough knowledge and experience in
		reciting verses, composed by themselves in no time. A few of them, when they read the past events, have to read
		very strictly the material as is found in the leaves, because the past has to be correct. Then only, the
		consultant will hear him further. But when the future is to be read, it is open to doubt as to whether he reads
		only those materials found on the leaves or he himself coins verses suiting to the taste of the querist. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In one case, a consultant and his friend caught hold of such a fraud, the Nadi reader, redhanded,
		because he had Maha- baratham on hand and read his life by having those leaves on hand, looking at them and
		turning over pages after pages every 5 minutes. Another experience at Benares was also published in the magazine
		Astrology and Athrishta. It is a pity that the existence of a very few of such people bring ridicule to this
		amazing Nadi. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Another investigation is also to be made to find out whether the documents are genuine and
		original. There is the doubt whether the authors, i.e., the sages, knew all languages including Tamil, etc., in
		South India, as they lived in the North having Sanskrit as the Mother Tongue and Nadis are found in all
		languages also whether they used paper and pen as some Nadis are found written in paper and claimed to be
		original. Whatever it is, there are records now, to prove that astrology was practised by many people, thousands
		of years ago who could predict even the birth time of a native in 20th century, the place of his birth, names of
		his parents, occupations, etc., and the events in his life marriage, profession, foreign journey, property,
		conveyance, etc. They had such profound knowledge. Now it has deteriorated to a very great extent, like a
		multimillionaire having a few hundreds in the bank. It is more or less in a pitiable condition in India.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In fact, there is probably not one science which is not properly understood, which so many
		pretend to know, and on which so many are prepared to express an opinion as in the case of astrology. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Westerners are always research-minded. If they had any truth in any statement and if they are
		convinced, they study it further, and develop it. It may be that there are failures. Yet they consider how it is
		possible to predict correctly in some cases, and why in other cases there is failure: and to find out the truth,
		they make research till something satisfactory is discovered. </p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334362">Astrology —— available data incomplete</h2>
<p class="block_4">Astrology today is incomplete and needs to be vastly supplemented. No one is in possession of all
		the findings of our sages; nor are we blessed with such a Guru who can impart correct scientific knowledge to
		us. Whatever we may have to day is only a part of what they have left behind. A subject taught by a Professor
		will be complete. We are not fortunate to I have such an advantage in our lifetime. So with what little
		literature we possess, we have to understand the fundamental principles and then, by regular and strenuous work,
		develop it. </p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334363">Astrology —— its Use and Limitations</h2>
<p class="block_4">Interpreted in all correctness, a knowledge of astrology does afford mental strength to the
		feeble and weak-minded, solace to the depressed, peace to the anxious and worried, and steadiness to those who
		are wavering and vacillating in mind. It is a common experience that when troubles come, they come in battalions
		and the afflicted person gets solace from this knowledge that the time is not far off when his or her troubles
		would cease to exist. A full-fledged astrologer, capable of handling the subject with meticulous care, helps in
		no small measure to dispel the fears in the querist's mind and braces him up to face the future with confidence
		and hope. The astrologer helps one to have a glimpse of the unknown future: the know- ledge of Destiny in store
		for one, stands one in good sted in surmounting difficulties that present themselves. This early knowledge
		renders it possible for one to reconcile himself to the situation one finds himself in, and any severe
		disappointment is unlikely since one is briefed as to when, one can cherish hopes and the extent one can do so.
		When Dame Fortune smiles and the world appears to be full of roses, few have any use for the science or for the
		saying Man proposes and God disposes. With the frowning of fortune, egoism mellows down, and becomes subdued.
		The knowledge gained through the Science helps one to be level-headed under any circum- stances whether affluent
		or adverse.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The knowledge of the future prompts one to render help to those who are in need, banish evil
		thoughts from the mind and make efforts to lead a simple, honest and pious life. The saying "Do your duty with
		sincerity and leave the result to God holds out a more forceful appeal. Astrology proves that success or failure
		depends on our previous Karma; suffer- ings are due to sins committed previously and this thought helps us to be
		good to society, repeatedly saying "It is probably because of some sin committed by me in the previous birth 1
		suffer now; let me not do harm in this life atleast to any body." </p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334364">Branches of Astrology</h2>
<p class="block_4">The various branches of astrology are:</p>
<p class="block_4">(a) Medical astrology or astro-pathology:</p>
<p class="block_4">(b) Astro-materiology:</p>
<p class="block_4">(c) Mundane astrology or Judicial astrology:</p>
<p class="block_4">(d) Natal astrology: Horary astrology:</p>
<p class="block_4">(f) Electional astrology:</p>
<p class="block_4">(g) Kabala astrology:</p>
<p class="block_4">(h) Kerala astrology:</p>
<p class="block_4">(i) Omens</p>
<p class="block_4">Let me explain what Natal astrology and Horary astrology mean?</p>
<h3 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334365">Natal Astrology</h3>
<p class="block_4">Natal astrology concerns largely with the life of human beings. A chart is made out for the
		moment of birth and for the particular place of birth (Latitude and Longitude being taken for calculation).</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">From such a chart, one can read all events about the native; his character, temperament and
		peculiarities, longevity, condition of health, accident, proneness, finance and fortune, marriage, birth of
		children and also his prosperity or adversity. Moreover, the actual date of any occurrence in his life can be
		calculated. Thus natal astrology is very useful for one and all, whether he is born a King, a Kubera, or a
		beggar: for health and longevity are precious to every individual. Fortune, prosperity, and above all, peace of
		mind and happiness are desired by all. Hence natal astrology is the most useful branch of this science and
		therefore, it behoves all of us to support and encourage genuine research, by trained workers and scholars, to
		bridge the incomplete phases in this, just as in every other branch of science.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">It is a fact that 100% correct predictions cannot be given with the literature available and with
		the knowledge that we may gain by studying them alone. It is only by plodding, persevering and patiently
		carrying out research that one will be able to fill up the gap, supplement, improve, and make it perfect. One of
		the sub-branches of Natal Astrology may be discussed for the consideration of the readers.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">There is a sub-branch called "Gochara Phalan" by the Hindus. Westerners call it "Transit." Let it
		be stated, with great humility, for the information of the readers, that the method of prediction adopted by
		research scholars is, in a way, an improvement over the application of the general principles of astrology
		handed down to us by our ancient sages and scholars.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In the Western System, the astrologers take the radical position of the Sun at the time of birth
		and consider the relative positions of the Planets transiting in the Zodiac and give their predictions. In India
		and in the Hindu System, the position of the Moon at the time of birth of the native is taken as the starting
		and determining point to which the transiting positions of the Planets are related, and according to their
		relative positions, we read the results and say whether the time is auspicious or not. Both the methods will be
		found to be incomplete and therefore the percentage of failures is bound to be large. This cannot be of much
		advantage to those who desire to know their future.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The Western and the Hindu systems of predictions based on the transits of planets fail in many
		cases whether referred either to the Sun or to the Moon alone.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">For transitory results. Fortuna deserves serious attention as it indicates certain results which
		are not shown by the aspects formed by the transiting planets to those in the natal chart </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">When it is found that the results enjoyed by people born within a few minutes of each other show
		diametrically opposite results, we should try and find out the factor which is so fast moving as to cause
		opposite aspects and bring about such different effects.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In those few minutes can planets move much? No! Then which will have a change in the position? Is
		it not lagna thereby the other II cusps and Fortuna.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">All research scholars will surely declare that the fast changing ascendant, the cusps of other
		houses and Fortuna cause different aspects and produce different results. If therefore the cusps and Fortuna are
		also included in all calculations and predictions offered, there can be no great room for disappointment.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Readers will do well at this stage to pause and ponder over the significant truths, placed before
		them in the preceding paragraphs. That Astrology, no doubt, is an accurate science can he proved by taking the
		following instances.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Identical results are enjoyed by people whose birth took place at the same minute, in the same
		Latitude and Longitude. Let me place before the readers in a tangible and systematic form my reasons:</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The first instance relates to two persons born at the same time and who both got married to two
		career girls who were earning. They had no children but both couples were very fond of domestic pets, cats and
		dogs. The two males were lecturers producing identical results, with equal interest in politics, philosophy and
		religion. Minor events in their lives were also strikingly similar; for example, both suffered from tooth-ache
		at the same time and on the same day. Yet, the two male partners were in no way related to each other and hailed
		from widely separated places.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Another instance is about two men born in the same village who narrated their experiences after
		they had lived there for a fairly long time. Their temperaments, behaviour and character were identical. Both
		had pleasing manners, were always cheerful and never rude to anyone. Both were robust in health and whenever one
		fell ill, the other also ailed from the same disease.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Each of them lost a child in the same month, and had the same number of children. One was a
		journalist, while the other was a writer of fiction. Mercury, Mars and Jupiter were the signs who ruled over
		their professions. The culmination in this extraordinary similarity was in the death of these two natives on the
		same day.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Yet another instance relates to a report. that appeared in a foreign journal in 1820. It
		mentioned that Samuel Hennings died at the age of 82. He was born on 4-6-1738 at a place situated in the same
		Latitude and Longitude, as King George III, who ascended the throne in October, 1760. Mr. Hennings was then an
		independent business-man. King George III got married on 8-9-1761 and on the same day Mr. Hennings took Elsie
		for his wife. Both had the same number of children of each sex. Both were long-lived and died at the same hour
		on 2-9-1820.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Instances can be multiplied for such remarkably coincident happenings. The principles governing
		such events will be explained in my magazine.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334366">Horary Astrology</h2>
<p class="block_4">This branch of science is mysterious, perfect, wonderful and most useful. After thoroughly
		undertsanding the principles, one can offer correct, clear and precise predictions without any confusion. This
		helps the astrologer to confirm what prediction he has to give by using other methods which, when explained,
		will convince and satisfy the consultant.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Generally, the astrologer asks the querist to give a number, at random, within 108. The number
		that is given forms the basis for the prediction. Some may scoff at this branch of science saying that the
		predictions given by Horary Astrology cannot be correct as the number given is, after all, a chance. They may
		suggest that the person could have given any other number or thought of one number and mentioned another. Such
		people do not realise that the querist cannot give any other number except the one which he had given
		occasionally, the lucky querist may mention a number, but the astrologer may mishear: Calculate on the misheard
		number. Here the divine force so works, that the number taken by the astrologer gives a clear and correct answer
		whereas the other number mentioned by the querist cannot offer such a clear clue to the astrologer. They have no
		personal experience that it is the divine force which works and enables the astrologer to predict. The number
		that he gives depends upon his past action or Karma as well as the future results he is to enjoy just as the
		moment of birth is the effect of his past Karma. None can convince that one's birth at the particular moment,
		whether normal or cessarian, is wonderful Divine Law. Has he or she the choice of parents or Divine Law, Has he
		or of the locality of birth?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Generally, this branch of science is resorted to, mostly by those who have no horoscopes or who
		doubt the correctness of them. This branch of science can answer all questions and clear all doubts. But on many
		occasions there are contradictory indications according to the birth charts when they try to predict using
		Traditional methods of prognostication; Krishnamurti's discovery is clear, convincing and correct.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">On those occasions, they can make the best use of Horary astrology for proper guidance and
		confirmation. Even when one decides to offer prediction using other branches of the science, Horary Astrology
		has to be used as a final safe method to declare with confidence the results already obtained.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">This method is as rational and as scientific as any other branch of astrology and it is the
		sublime art of fore-seeing events from the position of the planets at the moment when one propounds seriously a
		question about any important matter. By applying it, one can predict the longevity, health, success or failure
		in one's enterprise, one's stay in foreign land or his return, the time of marriage, the description of partner,
		re-union or divorce, birth and death of children, sex of the child, results of the examination, recovery of lost
		articles, gain by lottery or races or speculation, success in litigation, treasure, legacy and anything and
		everything on the earth.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">This branch of science is not a bluff. It is not to dupe the gullible throng. But at the same
		time, it is not easy for the students of astrology to make predictions infallibly unless they are thorough with
		the principles of astrology available now.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Not Numerology: Some mistake that the astrologer uses Numerology and predicts. They are ignorant.
		The number indicates the ascendant for that query and he calculates the position of planets for that moment of
		judgment and then judges the result.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334367">Why Horary Astrology is Preferred?</h2>
<p class="block_4">To find out the events in one's life or to know in advance the result of one's attempts or
		action, there are two methods, They are Natal Astrology and Horary Astrology.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">1. To erect a horoscope with 12 cusps and insert the planets at correct position, the time of
		birth should be accurate.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In India, the standard time was introduced on 1-1-1906 and any birth before this date was noted
		down according to the timing following by the postal authorities or railway authorities in that locality. Before
		standard time was introduced even when our watches show correct time, (agreeing with local time) yet the
		information given to the interested parties after the birth of the child by the attendants differ one from the
		other. Because, the medical attendants are anxious to do their job than to note the time. A few give the time of
		Siras-udhaya. A few note the time when the whole body of the child had been removed from that of a mother. There
		are instances wherein midwife gave a time, the nurse mentioned another, whereas the lady doctor differed from
		both of them. When such is the case which time can we take even though the clock shows the Indian Standard time
		correctly.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Hence, the time of the birth is in most of the cases are not correct at all.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">2. Whenever twins are born with a difference of few minutes and we erect horoscopes according to
		traditional system the picture remains the same for both except in the dasa balance. There also the difference
		is only by a few weeks. The position of the planets do not get changed, in the Bhava (House Division) nor they
		move at all even by a few minutes. So the horoscopes of both the twins appear for predictive side more or less
		same according to Hindu Traditional astrology: but Krishnamurti Padhdhati shows the difference. There are many
		instances wherein the results enjoyed by them are diametrically opposite. This shows that the moment of the
		birth of a child should be very correct, when only the prediction will come out accurately. If the time of birth
		differs by a few minutes then this horoscope refers to someone else and not to the consultant. So the reading
		fails.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">3. Any student of Astrology will not be able to carry out the research for decades and decades
		and have a satisfactory solution for the various problems within his lifetime. Honestly so many centuries will
		be needed to carry out the research on Natal horoscopes to find out the truth. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">4. But in Horary Astrology one takes the moment of the judgment, makes a chart and offers the
		result. This horoscope will be very correct and the result also will be amazingly accurate. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">5. One can understand the principles of Horary Astrology within a period of three months and he
		can apply the principles and in a year start carrying out the research on Horary Astrology and find out the
		truth within a couple of years. One can master this subject easily and offer useful predictions which come to
		pass. Horary Astrology is genuine and simple. It is most useful, as one can have the results or the solution for
		one's problem in a few minutes. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">6. In one's horoscope it may be found that the person will have an agricultural farm but one
		cannot say which variety of crop he will cultivate. But in Horary Astrology one can find out whether he will
		have oranges or grapes or lime fruit or sugarcane, etc. Therefore, to have exact and precise prediction Horary
		is useful. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">7. One may predict that the person will purchase a house in a particular period. But in which
		street and which house he will buy cannot be predicted from Natal chart. Horary Astrology is very useful to make
		the selection out of the many. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">8. Similarly, a young bridegroom may have to choose his wife from half a dozen brides suggested
		to him. Natal chart can show that he will get married but it is difficult to select any and declare that he
		would marry only a particular girl, whereas Horary Astrology is useful to make the selection and definitely
		declare whom he will surely marry. Thus it can be seen that Horary Astrology is most useful for one and all.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">9. Even in political Astrology when three or four people compete for election a few may have
		horoscopes; a few may not have at all. Even the horoscopes which they give may or may not be correct. Further,
		when four horoscopes are given it is very difficult, to pitch up one out of the four and declare that he alone
		will win. But in Horary Astrology after one takes one number for each candidate then he can correctly predict
		who would win in the election.</p>
