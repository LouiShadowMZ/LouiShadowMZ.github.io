don't have issue of their own.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 5th cusp is very important to see
whether one is capable of producing a child or not. The 11th house is the 5th
house of the partner. Therefore the 11th cusp shows whether the partner will be
able to produce children or not. If both 5th and 11th cusps are unfavourable,
both the husband and the wife will be sterile and if such a couple wants to
have a child, the only way out is to adopt somebody's child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To judge the time of birth of child, one
has to select the significators of houses 2, 5 and 11 predict the time during
the conjoined period of the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One will be able to produce children if the
following three conditions are simultaneously satisfied.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. The sub lord of the 5th cusp is not
retrograde,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. It is not posited in the constellation

satisfied one will not be able to produce a child at all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To assess the productivity of the
life-partner, judge the 11th cusp sub lord and find out whether the above three
conditions are simulataneously satisfied or not. If they are satisfied, the
partner can produce children. If any one of the three conditions is not
satisfied, productivity of the partner is not promised Let us see whether the
consultant (husband) can produce a child or not. Consider the 5th cusp. It is
Karkata 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 17', i.c. Moon sign Saturn star Jupiter
sub. Jupiter is retrograde. Therefore the husband cannot produce.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now let us see whether his wife can produce
a child. (If she can produce, then naturally, the child will not be due to the
husband). For this we have to judge the 11th cusp. It is 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 17' Makara i.e. Saturn sign Moon star and Jupiter sub. Jupiter
being retrograde, she too, is incapable of producing children.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore both the husband and the wife are
sterile and if at all they want to have a child the only way is to adopt
somebody's child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The consultant said that he wanted to adopt
the first child of his friend.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out whether a particular child will
go in adoption or not, one has to judge the 4th cusp of the child. If the sub
lord of the 4th cusp is deposited in a dual sign (or the sub lord itself is
Mercury) and if this sub lord is a significator of the 8th house (as it is the
house of legacy) the child goes in adoption.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8th house here plays a double role. One as
the house of legacy (the adopted child has a legal right on the property of the
adopted father), and another as the 12th house to father (indicated by 9th
house) showing separation from the father and going to the adopted father.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 4th house shows mother and the sub lord
of 4th cusp decides whether one goes in adoption or not. A doubt may arise in
somebody's mind as to why the 4th cusp be seen and why not the 9th. The answer
is very simple. Maternity is sure and paternity is not. (The mother may have
had pleasure with a person other than the husband and this child may be due to
him.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The consultant has no child of his own. He
wants to adopt the first child of his friend. Friend is shown by the 11th
house.. Therefore lagna of the child will be the 3rd house (5th to 11th.
counted from the consultant's lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The houses 4 and 8 of the child will be 6
and 10 counted from the consultant's lagna. Therefore we have to judge these
two houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 6th cusp is 17</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
17' Leo, i.e. Sun sign Venus star and Moon sub. The sub lord Moon is deposited
in Mithuna. It is a dual sign. Therefore the consultant can adopt his friend's
first child if the sub lord Moon is also a significator of 10th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is a significator of 10th house.
Therefore you will adopt your friend's first child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For the time of the event take out the
significators of the houses 6 and 10 from the above table. They are Sun, Moon,
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury is in the constellation of a
retrograde planet and Venus and Saturn are in the sub of retrograde planets.
Planets in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet appear to give
results but will ultimately fall through. Therefore exclude Mercury, Venus and
Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further Sun is conjoined with Rahu and
Jupiter is conjoined with Kethu. Therefore take Rahu in preference to Sun and
Kethu in preference to Jupiter because node firstly give the results of the
planet or planets with which it is conjoined, then the results of the planets
in whose constellation it is deposited, then the results of the planets
aspecting it and lastly the results of the owner of the sign in which the node
is deposited.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore finally the significators are
Moon, Rahu and Kethu. They will give the results during their conjoined period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to dasa-bhukti, Rahu Dasa Moon
Bhukti Kethu Antra will run from 11-8-1970 to 12-9-1970. You will adopt in this
period:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The exact date of adoption will be decided
by transit. Sun transits Moon sub in Kethu star Makha in the sign Leo owned by
Sun (represented by Rahu in dasa-bhukti) on 22-8-1970. Therefore you will adopt
on this date.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="10.11_When is the Child Birth.html">← When is the Child Birth</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_10.12_Am I to adopt">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="10.13_Can I gain in lottery_ When.html">Can I gain in lottery_ When →</a></div></body>
