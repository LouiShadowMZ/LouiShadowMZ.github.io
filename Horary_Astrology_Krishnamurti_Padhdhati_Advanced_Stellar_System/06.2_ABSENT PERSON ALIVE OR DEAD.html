<body><h2 id="heading_06.2_ABSENT PERSON ALIVE OR DEAD_0"><span lang="EN-US">ABSENT PERSON ALIVE OR DEAD</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Western system: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">One is interested to know whether the person who is absent, is alive
or dead, generally if one happens to be related to the absence. If he is a
brother, take the third house to represent him. If it is father as per Western
theory take the fourth as his ascendant; if it is a son take the fifth; if it
is wife take the 7th. If there is no relationship take the first house itself
to represent him (1 do not agree. Because according to me all people not
related to the native should be judged from the 9th house.) They take lord of 1
and also Moon to represent him. If the lord of lagna and Moon apply conjunction
or any adverse aspect to the lord of the 8th, he will shortly die. If these two
are forming separation aspect with lord of 8, and if there is no favourable
aspect he is already dead. The number of degrees between the significators give
the number of months, days etc. (Calculation Cumbersome). If lord of 1 is in 5
and it is squared by Moon there is the danger of death. If lord of 1 is conjoined
with lord of 8 and is in 8 or 4, he is already dead. This fails when lord of 1
is also lord of 8 and it is in 4 in good constellation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Krishnamurti Padhdhati: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Take that house which represents the relationship. For father and
for strangers take only the 9th house. Find out where the cusp falls. If the
sub- lord of the cusp is in the constellation of the planet who is the
significator of Bhadhaka and Maraka sthanas, boldly declare that he is dead. It
will prove to be very correct. If this significator is in a watery sign, he is
drowned; if it is in fiery sign he had received injuries and died. If it is an
earthy sign, he had natural end. If the sub-lord of the cusp of the house
representing the relative is in the constellation of the lord of that house or
the significators of the house representing that relation he is alive; if that
lord is also the significator of the sixth house counted from that house
representing him, then he is ill.</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.2_ABSENT PERSON ALIVE OR DEAD_1"><span lang="EN-US">News about the person When</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord of the cusp of the third
house counted from the ascendant of the horary chart (to get news) is in the
constellation of the planet who is the significator of 3 and 11, on the day
Moon transits that (1) position of the zodiac (sign, star and sub) which is
governed by the significators of 3 counted from the ascendant, (2) 3rd counted
from the house representing the relative and the 11th from the ascendant the
querist will receive the letter. The exact time, will be the moment when the
ascendant on that day to the place of residence on that day (Latitude and
Longitude) governed by the significators just above mentioned, rises in the
cast. Because a consultant may be wandering here and there in search of the
absentee. At the time, he hears the news or receives a letter or phone or wire
the locality may be different. The position of the ascendant varies according
to latitude and the time according to longitude even though for a particular
moment Sun, Moon and the other planets may be in the same position in the
zodiac. Position of Moon and the ascendant alone is to be judged. In case if
the significator is connected with Saturn, find out in which month Sun will
reach that position of the zodiac.</span></p><span lang="EN-US"><br clear="all"/>
