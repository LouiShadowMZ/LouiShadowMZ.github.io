<body><h2 id="heading_01.8_Horary Astrology_0"><span lang="EN-US">Horary Astrology</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This branch of science is mysterious,
perfect, wonderful and most useful. After thoroughly undertsanding the
principles, one can offer correct, clear and precise predictions without any
confusion. This helps the astrologer to confirm what prediction he has to give
by using other methods which, when explained, will convince and satisfy the
consultant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally, the astrologer asks the querist
to give a number, at random, within 108. The number that is given forms the
basis for the prediction. Some may scoff at this branch of science saying that
the predictions given by Horary Astrology cannot be correct as the number given
is, after all, a chance. They may suggest that the person could have given any
other number or thought of one number and mentioned another. Such people do not
realise that the querist cannot give any other number except the one which he
had given occasionally, the lucky querist may mention a number, but the
astrologer may mishear: Calculate on the misheard number. Here the divine force
so works, that the number taken by the astrologer gives a clear and correct
answer whereas the other number mentioned by the querist cannot offer such a
clear clue to the astrologer. They have no personal experience that it is the
divine force which works and enables the astrologer to predict. The number that
he gives depends upon his past action or Karma as well as the future results he
is to enjoy just as the moment of birth is the effect of his past Karma. None
can convince that one's birth at the particular moment, whether normal or
cessarian, is wonderful Divine Law. Has he or she the choice of parents or
Divine Law, Has he or of the locality of birth?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally, this branch of science is
resorted to, mostly by those who have no horoscopes or who doubt the
correctness of them. This branch of science can answer all questions and clear
all doubts. But on many occasions there are contradictory indications according
to the birth charts when they try to predict using Traditional methods of
prognostication; Krishnamurti's discovery is clear, convincing and correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On those occasions, they can make the best
use of Horary astrology for proper guidance and confirmation. Even when one
decides to offer prediction using other branches of the science, Horary
Astrology has to be used as a final safe method to declare with confidence the
results already obtained.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This method is as rational and as
scientific as any other branch of astrology and it is the sublime art of
fore-seeing events from the position of the planets at the moment when one
propounds seriously a question about any important matter. By applying it, one
can predict the longevity, health, success or failure in one's enterprise,
one's stay in foreign land or his return, the time of marriage, the description
of partner, re-union or divorce, birth and death of children, sex of the child,
results of the examination, recovery of lost articles, gain by lottery or races
or speculation, success in litigation, treasure, legacy and anything and
everything on the earth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This branch of science is not a bluff. It
is not to dupe the gullible throng. But at the same time, it is not easy for
the students of astrology to make predictions infallibly unless they are
thorough with the principles of astrology available now.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Not Numerology: Some mistake that the
astrologer uses Numerology and predicts. They are ignorant. The number
indicates the ascendant for that query and he calculates the position of
planets for that moment of judgment and then judges the result.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="01.7_Branches of Astrology.html">← Branches of Astrology</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_01.8_Horary Astrology">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="01.9_Why Horary Astrology is Preferred.html">Why Horary Astrology is Preferred →</a></div></body>
