divided into twelve equal parts; each division is called a Solar mansion (or
rasi, or sign.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">They are Aries Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius. Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Hindus have another division also. The
Zodiac is divided into twenty-seven equal parts: each measures 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20' They commence from Aries 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and end by
Pisces 30. The 27 divisions are called Lunar Mansions (Nakshatras, Asterisms,
Stars Constellations). They are called Aswini, Bharani. Karthikai, Rohini. ...
Uthrapathrapada and Revathi,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The explanation that I can offer why they
have taken 9 planets and divided the Zodiac into 27 Nakshatras is as follows:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Zodiac is 360</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
in longitude. What is the sanctity in the number 360. Probably, Sun moves in
between the stars, in its path the Ecliptic-daily on an average, about of the
circle. So, every day, in 24 hours, Sun moves 1. Further, 360 is divisible by
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 10. 12, etc. when it will be easy for other
calculations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is first divided into 3 equal parts of
120</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> each. The four signs Aries. Taurus, Gemini and
Cancer make up 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> The next four signs Leo, Virgo,
Libra and Scorpio form 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US">, Sagittarius, Capricorn,
Aquarius and Pisces are the last 4 signs measuring 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US">.
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All planets moving from Vernal Equinox
Aries-Mesha O according to Nirayana System-get their results modified as they
move in the Zodiac. In the first 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>′<span lang="EN-US">. i.e., 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> any planet transitting in Mesha (Aries) will be influenced by
Kethu, and the constellation is called Aswini. Then when it passes on, between
13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20' and 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40', Venus
influences it; this area is called Bharani. Between 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
40' and 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> of Aries and from 0 Taurus to 10 Taurus,
the planet's results will be modified by Sun, Karthikai is the name of the
star, or constellation which I call as Zone. Then from 10 Taurus to 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20' Moon modifies the results of the planet occupying this Zone or
Lunar Mansion called Rohini. Between 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20' in Taurus
and 30 Taurus. as well as 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Gemini to 6" 40</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Gemini, the Zone or mansion called Mrigasirisha is ruled by Mars
and the planet in this Zone will be under the control of Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The next 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, called Arudra, is governed by Rahu: next Punarvasu is ruled by
Jupiter (Guru). It is followed by Pushya and Ashlesha governed by Saturn and
Mercury respectively.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, from Simha 0 (Leo) upto the end
of Scorpio, the four signs are divided into 9 lunar mansions (called Nakshatra,
Stars or Constellations). They are called Makam, Poorvapalguni, Uthrapalguni,
Hastham, Chithrai, Swathi, Visakam, Anuradha and Jyeshta which are ruled by 9
planets in the same order, viz., Kethu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars (Sevvai, Mangal,
Angaraka, Kuja). Rahu. Jupiter (Guru) Saturn (Sani), and Mercury (Budha).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The remaining 1/3 of the Zodiac contains
the 4 signs Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces; and the nine
constellations in it are Moolam, Poorvashada, Uthrashada, Sravana, Dhanishta,
Sathabisha, Poorvapathrapada, Uthrapathrapada and Revathi. The planets Kethu,
Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu. Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury rule the stars in the
same. order.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, planets in between 0 and 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' in Aries (Aswini), 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' in Leo (Makam), and 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' in Sagittarius (Moolam) will be under the sway of Kethu; 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' in Aries to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">40' Bharani. 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">40 (Leo) Poorvapalguni; 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">40</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in
Sagittarius (Poorvashada), these three zones are ruled by Venus and planets
transitting in these zones are under the influence of Venus and the results of
Venus will be offered by the planet, transitting in this Zone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, each planet governs three zones in
the Zodiac.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a planet were to be in Aswini, another
in Makam and the third in Moolam, all are under the influence of Kethu and in
Kethu's zone. If the astrologer says that a planet is modified by the lord of
the constellation Kethu, then the statement is not complete and clear. He has
to add, whether it is in Aries, or Leo. or Sagittarius, otherwise one cannot
locate the position of the planet correctly. That is why 27 different names are
given to the 27 constellations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Aswini - Arietus - Stars 3<br/>

<br/>
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, these 27 stars are to guide us,
so that we can calculate and ascertain the position of the 27 zones in the
Zodiac, each measuring 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20'.<br/>
<br/>
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These 27 constellations are governed by the
9 planets. Hence, each planet rules over three zones at an interval of 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> (e.g.) KETHU-Aswini, Makam, Moolam, VENUS (Sukra) -Bharani, Pooram,
Pooradam and so on.<br/>
<br/>
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These zones modify the results of the
planets transitting the Zodiac and not the stars, scattered in the Heavens
which are far, far away. Planets are the immediate neighbours of our mother
Earth and these belong to one family. Probably this is the reason why they have
selected only 27 groups of stars even though there are numberless stars in the
sky which can influence the earth as much as these 27 groups.<br/>
<br/>
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose (a) there is a light in the centre
of a circular room provided with 12 glass panes of different colours, (b)
around the room there is a verandah and outside it, there are 27 glass panes of
which the colour 1, 10 and 19, is the same; 2, 11 and 20 differ from 1, 10, 19
but these three are of the same colour: 3, 12 and 21 differ from others but
these three are of the same colour as they belong to one group. Similarly, all
the 27 panes are of 9 different colours<br/>
<br/>
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a person walks outside the circular
verandah looking at the light inside, he will find the colour of the light
getting changed according to the colour of the coloured panes. Similarly, the
results of the planets are modified by the lord of the sign and indicated by
the lord of the Nakshathra or constellation.<br/>
<br/>
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a planet is compared to a torch light,
then the influence of the sign-Solar Mansion occupied by it and the influence
of the Zones of 13°20' called stars, change the colour of the light. Suppose a
railway guard shows the light. It may be plain, or green or red according to
the background mirror.<br/>
<br/>
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, imagine that the mirror used
behind the bulb is the lord of the sign. It may be clear and it may illuminate
to a maximum or it may be dull rendering the light, weak. The strength and
modification of the colour depends on the mirror behind the bulb (which is the
reflector) which denotes whether a planet is exalted and strong or debilitated
and weak.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also suppose one coloured slide is inserted
between the torch light and the observer. This colour depends on the lord of
the constellation when the planet is the bulb.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, the results of a planet in
different positions in the Zodiac, in different signs and different
constellations is similar to the light from the torch getting modified and the
resultant becoming absolutely different from the original light, unless all the
colours are similar to that of the planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In my research I found that one should not
satisfy himself with the modification of the lord of the constellation alone.
But. one has to find out further sub-divisions, which should be: scientific, so
that one can explain the differences between twin births.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, I have divided each star in a manner
which will be explained shortly. Suppose, we do not sub-divide, then we offer
prediction taking into consideration the situation of a planet in a particular
sign and star. It will be similar to saying that a particular dasa of a person
will be brilliant. The dasa lord may be Venus. It will run for 20 years. Even
though, in general, these 20 years might have proved to be beneficial, yet
there would have been occasions when we could have had difficulties, trials and
tribulations also, but these difficulties when compared to the beneficial
results, may not be much. It may be similar to a person being foretold that he
would gain in a race on a particular day. No doubt he may lose in the first
race, lose in the second, gain in the third, again lose in the fourth and gain
in the last few races. When we calculate, we may find that he had gained on
that particular day. But consider his anxiety whenever he lost, especially in
the first two races. It is similar to taking a planet, the sign and the star in
which it was and passing judgment. But according to Krishnamurti
Padhdhati" it will be possible to say that he will gain at a particular
time and also conclude, that it is a day of profit. This method of forecast is
not merely advantageous but correct and convincing as well.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a person is told that during Venus
Dasa, he will be fortunate, no doubt, during Venus Dasa, Venus Bhukthi he gets
married; Venus Dasa, Sun Bhukthi he starts business; Venus Dasa, Moon Bhukthi
he goes overseas, Venus Dasa, Mars bhukthi he has a son. Venus Dasa Rahu
Bhukthi some elder member in the family passes away: Venus Dasa Jupiter Bhukthi
there is expansion in the business and he has another child. During Venus Dasa,
Saturn Bhukti there is some labour trouble and minor losses. In Venus Dasa, Mercury
Bhukti be opens branches, takes up agencies and during Venus Dasa Kethu Bhukthi
he visits various pilgrim centres. On the whole, no doubt, the person got
married, started business, went overseas, expanded business and stabilised it.
Also one should not forget that he had lost a member of the family, had labour
trouble, suffered some loss and had worries for some time. If a person is
informed that in these 20 years, Venus will cause Rajayoga it will not help him
much. But indeed, it would be useful only when he is informed both the time of
event and also the nature of event, both good and bad. So, the dasa of 20 years
is sub- divided into sub-periods otherwise called bhukti.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the same analogy, I established that the
division of a constellation was necessary if correct results are to be
forecast.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a person is informed that he will
have very good business and profit on a particular day. He feels depressed till
2 p.m., as there was no business till then and in these hours he loses his
faith in astrology: but the planets so adjust that a few marriage parties enter
his shop and make purchases from him for an amount much greater than what he
had been normally collecting daily. If the same astrologer could tell him that
only between 2 and 4 pm, on that day he would do excellent business, it would have
been advantageous for both. Then the method is scientific so the sub-divisions
of the constellation are an imperative necessity to predict exact time of
event.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again, as a result of intensive research it
has been possible to find out why a person receiving a few letters on a day in
a particular moment, feels very happy when he goes through the contents of a
letter, next feels dejected and depressed when he reads the other, gets
irritated when he goes through the third and so on. It was found that the
ascendant and the cusp of the houses move faster than the planets and it is the
ascendant and the cusp of the houses which explain such rapid changes due to
occupation of the star and sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ascendant can move in a sign for about
2 hours; but in a constellation, it can only be for about 50 to 58 minutes. But
certain events may happen within an interval of 10 or 15. minutes. Therefore,
there should be some other minute factor which brings about varying results in
a very short time. So, it was found that the ascendant in that constellation
(star) showed that he would receive letters. But to indicate which moment he
would read a pleasant letter, which moment he would read that letter which would
irritate him and so on, further divisions of the constellation was necessary.
This method was found in 1951 and it is convincing, and most scientific.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take another example. Suppose, we
judge the results according to the transit of the planets. It is generally
stated that Saturn while transiting the 11th house will produce most desirable
results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn will be passing through the 11th
house, roughly for a period of two and a half years. Saturn signifies certain
matters to the person according to his chart and only such of those matters
alone will be expected by him. It is not uncommon (1) that for a long time
after the entry of Saturn into the 11th house, the person continues to suffer
and is not able to reconcile, (2) some actually suffer all the time whereas
they enjoy when Saturn transits in the 12th sign. When Saturn is in 11, what
actually one will enjoy, or experience depends on the lord of the constellation
and the lord of the sub, according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati and this would
explain why the Traditional system fails miserably.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First of all, I would like to say emphatically
that all persons having Saturn in 11 can never expect favourable results
because the ascendant may be different and the lords of the constellations in
the 11th house may be ruling evil houses to that lagna-born. Thereby the person
will and must experience difficulties through the source indicated by Saturn
(the transiting planet), But, according to my technique, when Saturn is passing
in a constellation, throughout that period, he neither enjoys nor suffers
uniformly, but during certain periods he finds beneficial results compensating
for the difficulties. The method which I advocate is very correct and it will
never fail: because, take the sub-division of the constellation. The
constellation indicates the matters signified by its lords: the planet
transiting influence such results denoted by the lord of the star through the
source denoted by the transiting planet (by nature, lordship and occupation
etc.) and it is the sub-lord which decides whether the result is favourable or
unfavourable. The lord of the constellation is similar to the lord of a dasa of
the Vimshothari system, whereas the sub is the lord of the sub- period or
Bhukti. So, I have evolved a method to divide the constellation based upon the
sound principles of astrology, which will appeal to one and all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose, Moon enters a particular
constellation, say Bharani (the second star of the 27 stars), the longitude of
which extends from 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US">40</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> of Aries (Mesha) and a child is born at
that moment. What do we say? Is it not that the child is to run Venus Dasa and
it will have 20 years of Venus Dasa left over at the time of the birth? The
child is having Venus Dasa, Venus Bhukti at the time of the birth. If Moon
moves a little further, say 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> (ie. 14</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' in Aries-Mesha), we say that the child has a balance of 18 years
6 months and also that the child will have Venus Dasa. Venus Bhukti at the time
of the birth. But, when Moon has moved 20/120 of Bharani and a child is born
then, we say that the child has a balance of 16 years 8 months and that the
child is having Venus Dasa, Sun Bhukti, just starting. If Moon further moves by
6/120 of the star, and a child is born, we say that the child commences with
Moon Bhukti. If further Moon moves by 10/120 of the star, we say the child will
be having Venus Dasa, Mars Bhukti Moon moves further by 7/120 of Bharani. So,
Mars sub is also over: Rahu sub starts. Let it go on. When it completes 18/120
of this star, Rahu sub is over and Jupiter starts. Thus, it will be seen that
the Moon is influenced by the exact position which it occupies in the
constellation. Therefore, Moon in the beginning is under the sway of Venus and
the sub of Venus. Then, Moon is in the constellation of Venus and the sub of
Sun. Next it passed in the same constellation belonging to Venus but in the sub
of Moon. It is followed by the sub of Mars, then by Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn,
Mercury, and lastly by Kethu. So according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati each
constellation is sub-divided into 9 parts. They are not equal in the longitude
but the longitude of each sub is in the proportion in which they are allotted
the total number of years in Vimshothari Dasa system.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The longitude of each constellation is 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20' equal to 800 minutes. Therefore, in every constellation of 800
minutes each planet will have an area equal to the number of years allotted to
each in the dasa multiplied by 6 and 2/3 minutes. Therefore, Sun's sub extends
to 40 minutes whatever be the constellation. Mars and Kethu extend for 46-2/3
minutes, Moon extends for 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6-2/3, Rahu extends for
exactly 2. Jupiter has an area of 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 46' 40"
Mercury 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US">53' 20": Saturn 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 13' 20".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even though the area allotted to each
planet is the same in cach star, yet the order in which they occupy the
constellation differs. To note the order, one has to find out which planet
rules the constellation, then the beginning of the constellation is ruled by
the lord of the star, just like in any dasa, the first sub- period or bhukti is
ruled by the dasa lord. The second sub is ruled by the bhukti lord who will
follow the dasa lord. Then in the same cyclic order the subs will be ruled as
in the bhuktis</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Aswini, the first sub is allotted to
Kethu, the second to Venus, the third to Sun, the fourth to Moon and so on till
the last sub is given to Mercury. Aswini is ruled by Kethu. So the first sub is
allotted to Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the star is Rohini, note the lord of the
star. It is Moon. Hence, allot the first sub to Moon. In the cyclic order, who
will follow Moon? It is Mars. So the second sub is given to Mars, the third to
Rahu, the fourth to Jupiter and so on till the last sub is governed by Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the star is Punarpushyam, otherwise
called Punarvasu, the first subdivision is governed by Jupiter, next by Saturn
and the last by Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the star is Pushya, the lord is Saturn.
Therefore the first sub is governed by Saturn, the second sub is ruled by
Mercury, the third is allotted to Kethu and so on till the last sub is under
the sway of Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the star is Aslesha, otherwise called
Ayilyam, the first sub-division is governed by Mercury, the next by Kethu and
so on, till the last sub-division is allotted to Saturn..</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus all the twenty-seven stars are divided
among the nine planets. It may appear as though the whole Zodiac is divided
into 27 multiplied by 9 parts. Actually, the lord of the sign, the lord of the
star and the lord of the sub will be 249 instead of 243. If one can refer to
the table, it is easy for one to know how the stars 27 in number even though
each is divided into 9 divisions, totalling to 243 divisions, yet due to the
change in the sign lord (lord of the sign), as certain subs are found in 2 adjacent
signs, they are 249 in number. (Furthermore one can sub-divide and record the
results.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><h3 id="heading_04.4_ZODIAC_1"><span lang="EN-US">CONSTELLATION AND SUB</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The zodiac is divided into 27 equal parts.
Each is called an asterism, Nakshathra, star or constellation. They are equal
in: longitude. Each constellation is 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> or 800</span>′<span lang="EN-US">. It commences from Mesha Aries 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> which is ever 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> opposite to Spica Star
and the 27 stars ruled by Kethu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn

order extend from Leo 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to Scorpio 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US">; again they follow the same order Kethu to Mercury from Sagittarius

is the sign, i.e., one of the twelve equal divisions of the zodiac. The other
is the equal divisions of the zodiac into 27 equal parts which is 13 degrees 20
minutes cach, called constellation. Therefore, the tenant in a sign is stronger
than the lord of the sign and the tenant in a constellation is stronger than
the lord of the constellation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence a planet in a sign will give to a

success during Saturn, Mars and Sun sub periods; desirable benefits during
Jupiter and Mercury sub periods. But Kethu in 10. Venus in 11 and Rahu in 4

Sun must be the worst. Jupiter also will fall in 12th Bhava and ought to have
been very bad. Venus and Budha causing Dharma Karmadhipathi Rajayoga should
give brilliant results. Rahu representing Venus must cause Rajayoga. Mars
should be dangerous. This person was my friend for a long number of years and
such results alone opened my eyes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In 1939, when I visited Coimbatore, I heard
one Nadi reader reading the results of a few persons in his cottage. I
understood that planets' results were read as they were found in the Bhavas.
Then I heard many Nadi readers. None made use of the constellation. While
reading the Nadi, I understood that without assigning the reason, the results
were read and they were astoundingly meticulously correct. For the future they
gave the reasons taking the traditional methods of the Bhavas and the future
proved to be mostly a failure. So, I started the research collecting the
horoscopes of old people with past events.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Such horoscopes as shown above threw the
light. What is it? A planet ‘A’ offers the results of the house occupied by the
lord of the star ‘B’ wherein this planet ‘A’ is deposited,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again trouble arose when 2, 3 or 4 planets
were found in the same constellation, as all the planets in the same star,
though referring the same matters, yet gave diametrically opposite results,
i.e., if planets A, B, C and D are in one constellation, in the same house. A
and C gave pleasant results whereas B and D gave just opposite results. This
made me think further. I found that a particular dasa is to cause Rajayoga. But
yet, he gets most desirable results in some Bukties and irrepairable disadvantageous
results in some Bhukties,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then I started doing research and in all
cases I found that planets, though they are in the same constellation, yet a
few of them alone can be beneficial and a few must be unfavourable. This caused
me to further carry on the research. I found that every constellation must be
divided in the manner, I have said, into 9 subs and each sub having that area
in a constellation in the proportion in which they are allotted the number of
years in Vimsodhari Dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I proved that planets occupying any one
constellation has connection with the bhava occupied by the lord of the
constellation. These planets in that constellation are termed as the
"Significators" of the Bhava occupied by the lord of the constellation.
Thus if one works out, for all the planets, then each planet is found to
signify the matters of a few houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then judge each planet. The planet
signifies a matter. Whether it votes for the progress and prosperity of that
matter depends on the sub lord: it is not capable of doing good, but, it does
harm to that bhava signified by the planet, if the sub lord is detrimental to
that house matters</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This discovery has crowned me with success.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I say, "If a planet is the
significator of lagna bhava, it gives long life, success in attempts, it helps
to maintain good health, if the sub lord is not also the significator of 6 or 8
or 12. If the sub-lord of the planet signifies 6th house if the planet
signifying lagna results by occupying the constellation of a planet in Lagna
Bhava occupies such a sub ruled by the significator of 6, he falls ill. The
constellation refers his health, sub signifying 6 gives disease. If a planet
signifies lagna bhava and it is in the sub of the significator of 8 he meets
with danger.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord signifies 12th house and
the significator of lagna is in such a sub, one runs away, or imprisoned, or
hospitalised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore constellation lord shows whom or
which matter it refers. But the deciding factor, good or bad, success or
failure is shown by the sub occupied by the significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">﻿</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a planet A is the significator of
second bhava and it is in the sub of 6 one borrows but if it is in the sub of 8
or 12, he lends or repays loan. Second shows finance. Do you receive a cheque
or issue a cheque is shown by the sub-lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is in the sub of 11, there is gain of
what? Either money or son-in-law or daughter-in-law or child birth to the
person. Because 2nd house shows family, 11th indicates the above relations. If
the significator of the second house is in the sub of the significator of 3,
through brother one gains, brother loses or gives away: if it is in the sub of
4, one may have car. or house during the period of the significator of 2nd
house deposited in the sub of 4th house significator, in their conjoined
periods. If the significator of the 4th house rules the sub and if it is also
the significator or 11, he purchases and acquires: if the sub-lord who is also
the significator of 12 other than 4, he sells and converts the permanent
possession as liquid cash and his bank position improves by losing the car or
building. If the sub-lord of planet signifying second house is the significator
of 10 and 12, then he lets his land for tenancy or lets the house for rent.
Why? 10th house is the 4th to the 7th which whom you transact: So, that which
he takes, is given by you (12) and he is indebted (6). 10th being 4 to 7, 10
denotes other's possession and it is your business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose a planet is the significator of 7th
house and if it is in the sub of 2 or 11 one gains, there is reunion, one gets
married, etc. If it is in the sub of the significator of 12, separation or
ill-health to wife. If it is in the sub of 1 and 2, danger to partner's life.
There can be 3 or 4 or any number of significators for the 7th. Therefore,
during the period or sub- period of a planet in such a sub whose lord signifies
12th house, wife falls ill or the native goes away and separation is caused. If
the sub-lord signifies 6th house, the wife goes away, thereby there is
separation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the planet is the significator of 7th
house and sub of 4, partner gains, makes money, and earns name. If the
significator of 7 is in the sub of 5, partner makes money, friendship and
enjoys pleasure. If the sub is ruled by the significator of 8th house, there is
either income or danger to life. If that significator of 8th house is also
significator of 5, partner gains. But significator of 8 is also significator of
1 and 7, it means death to partner as 8 and 1 are maraka houses to the 7th.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus one should note separately what each
planet signifies. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then in which sub each planet is posited.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Finally one should take each house and
judge to which bhavas the planets are the significators and the sub-lords.
Judge calmly how cach bhava is receiving good results from a few and adverse
from the rest.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Say, mother, father, child, etc. Mother is
shown by 4th house: father by 9th house: child by 5th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, note the significators of 4: so also
the significators of 9 and 5.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us take the following chart: </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">
