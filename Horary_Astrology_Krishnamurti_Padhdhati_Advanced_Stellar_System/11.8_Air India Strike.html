<body><h2 id="heading_11.8_Air India Strike_0"><span lang="EN-US">Air India Strike</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Mr. Raghavan, Publicity officer of
A.I.R. an officer of Air India from Bombay and Mr. A. D. Mani, M. P. editor of
Hitawata and I were discussing. Mr. A. D. Mani asked me "What do you think
of the strike. The officer says that on Monday at noon a final decision will be
taken. Will it be settled tomorrow".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I turned to the officer who is concerned
with "Air India" and asked him to mention a number within 108. I did
not ask Mr. A. D. Mani as he and I are not directly connected with Air India.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Officer, unhesitatingly mentioned
"80"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally I observed that whenever one
talks, one used to mention "Two hundred times I told you, you do not hear
me ". When I enquire I find that he was drawing the same salary of Rs. 200
for nearly 10 years which is the maximum in the scale of pay Rs. 100-10-200: So
he ever remembers 200. Another used to mention always 108, as he is very
generous. This gentleman told 80, probably he may wish to live to an age of 80.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the zodiac is divided into 108 equal
parts 27 stars multiplied by 4 quarters and the number mentioned is 80. We have
to take the 80th division, i.e., the 4th quarter of the 20th star counted from
the first star Aswini. It is Poorvashada 4th pada, ie., 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> to 26 40 in Sagittarius Nirayana
Zodiac. The position of planets at the time of query and answer is as follows:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">

</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lagna is in Jupiter's sign, Sagittarius; in
the star Poorvashada ruled by Venus: the sub may be Saturn or Mercury or Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is in the constellation of Venus and
Saturn sub, Venus rules the 6th and the 11th houses. Hence, 6th house indicates
dispute and 11th house promises compromisc as well as success. Moon denotes the
query: it is called "Mathi", the mind: what one has in his mind is
judged from the position of Moon. Moon in the 8th Bhava indicates difficulty:
Sun's sign occupied by Moon suggests the difference of opinion with the
Government. Venus star-Poorvapalguni- occupied by Moon denotes transport department.
Saturn sub confirms strike.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Venus owns not only the 6th house and
also any other house except the 11th one, then there will be further difficulty
and compromise is not in sight.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the 11th house promises honourable
agreement acceptable by both the strikers and the Government, I unhesitatingly
said that one can expect compromise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When</span>？</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As Venus rules the 11th cusp, find whether
Rahu or Kethu occupies either of the sign belonging to Venus. Because the node
is stronger than the lord of sign, and the tenant is stronger than the owner,
Rahu deposited in Taurus owned by Venus, represents Venus. Hence one is to
judge the sensitive point to be transited by Moon (under the sway of Venus by
being deposited in Venus star), and the Ascendnat (in the constellation of
Venus in Poorvashada).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which is the sensitive point promising
peace and settlement?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As Venus is lord of 11, Rahu denotes 11th
house results by acting as an agent of Rahu, Vemus and Rahu are the
significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lagna is to be judged for success or
failure. Lagna is in Jupiter's sign, Venus star, and in the sub of Saturn,
Mercury or Kethu</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter is in the sixth bhava, showing that
the person who put the question will start working when on Jupiter's day,
Thursday or on Jupiter's star day Punarvasu or Visakam or Poorvapadra</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn sub or Mercury sub or Kethu sub is
to be considered. Saturn, lord of 2 and 3 conjoins with retrograde Mercury
shortly within 24 hours and Mercury becomes direct in a day. Hence Saturn will
delay and within 24 hours nothing can be settled but a depressing and
threatening news will be published to unnerve the servants, Mercury governs
nervous system, mental strength and news in the paper after interview.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury sub shows, a lord of 10, that till
Mercury is retrograde i.e., Monday 4-4-1966, no compromise will be arrived at
Only after it takes direct course, both the Government and the servants will
come to an agreement on Mercury's day Wednesday or in Mercury star day
Ashlesha, or Jyeshta or Revathi. Lagna will be governed by Venus, Rahu and
Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu is in Scorpio, but in 11th Bhava
House. Kethu is also favourable. None of the sub is adverse: Therefore the
astrologer has to use the science of Astrology--an intelligent anticipation by
properly interpreting the message to the planets and select the time as well as
the nature of event.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) I took the Ephemeris and found out
whether there is a moment in the future, when the ascendant will be governed by
Mercury, Venus, Rahu and Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On Wednesday, ruled by Mercury, Moon
transits in Venus sign, Moon enters Swathi star only at 4-52 P.M. Therefore on
Wednesday 6-4-66 after 4-52 P.M. it improves. Then Jupiter sub is to be
transitted by Moon. Moon passes in Rahu sub for a period of 18/120 of 22 hours
26 mts, =18/120 x1346=3 hrs. 22 mts. Adding this to 4-52 P.M. I said that
agreement will be arrived at only after 8-14 P.M. on Wednesday. It will not go
beyond Jupiter's sub. Moon will transit in Jupiter's sub for 16/120 x22 hrs. 26
mts = 16/120 x 1346=3 hours. Therefore on Wednesday between 8-14 P.M. and 11-14
P.M. it will be agreed.. Venus sub sub will be at 9.44 P.M. when agreement is
arrived at.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Joining duty when?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lagna 6th house and 10th house indicate
one's starting the work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence select the significators Jupiter,
lord of Lagna, Rahu denoting Venus, Venus and Mercury, lord of 10. Therefore
the significators are Jupiter, Venus Rahu and Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I selected Jupiter's day-Thursday, Moon
transiting in Venus sign Rahu star and Mercury sub for the announcement of the
agreement, ie, between </span>（<span lang="EN-US">18+16+19</span>）<span lang="EN-US">x 22 hours 26 mts. added to 4-52 P.M. when Swathi star started.
i.e., 594 mts. after 4-52 P.M.: 2-46 A.M. on 7th to 17 /120 x 22 hours 26 mts.
to 5-56 A.M. Hence the news was printed and published between 2-46 and 5-56
A.M. on the 7th.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Joining duty is on Jupiter day Thursday.
Swathi star day and Venus sub, i.e., after 7-14 A.M. on 7-4-66 and before 10-58
A.M.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, I predicted that the agreement will
be arrived at on Wednesday (not during office hours) but only late in the night
and the Air India will start functioning around 8-45 A.M. on Thursday,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">﻿</span><span lang="EN-US">This article is to explain how to select the day, the time, etc., by

astrologer is to make a selection and then proceed. But if a number is given
within 249, nothing is left to the choice of the astrologer, except to follow
one route only. That is why, asking for a number within 108 is forgotten and
only within 249 is in use.]</span></p><span lang="EN-US"><br clear="all"/>
