sweet smelling and beautiful flowers and also thorns. Good and bad both exist.
Similarly there are men who can be bought and there are also those whom we
cannot buy. There are immoral fellows and rogues, large in number who never
hesitate to sell their souls and the bodies for money and for such favourites
of those persons. Are there not instances wherein due to bribery and corruption
the election was held void. Those who sell themselves do not consider that they
become slaves. Also those who buy do not consider that such a practice is
unfair, Only those who do not want to maintain dignity or self-respect accept
and without any principle nor considering that he should be fair and just act
in the manner in which the person who pays the bribe. This is not only in the
election but in every quarters if that person's co-operation is needed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If one is elected in that manner and he
uses the political power for one's interests, it is a curse. It is the greatest
blessing to the community if the person elected or the person appointed carries
out his job intelligently and impartially, but according to convention and the
rules and regulations prevailing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Goldsmith was a gentleman of character whom
nobody could buy. He refused to do dirty political work. He starved many days.
He was arrested for having not paid the rent for his house. Johnson understood
his poverty, met him; as Goldsmith could not accept anything from others as a
gift, etc. Johnson took the manuscript of Vicar of Wakefield, sold it and paid
the rent and released him. There are such honest people.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The experience has taught that such people
whom you buy will never be your fast friend. If another person pays more, he
will desert you. Also such people are never grateful. A person drawing salary
every month from an office for something he does and acts against the interest
of the employer. When such is the case how can you expect that he would stick
on, be your permanent friend and ever help you. People with character should
never try to buy. Do not tempt others and spoil them. Beggars increase in number
because there are people to do charity. Hence those whom you buy are spoiled by
you. The person would be unscruuplous, having the only principle to do favour
to one who offers illegal gratification. So such a person is to be the
benefactor and your desire is to be fulfilled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whomsoever you approach is judged from the
7th house. 11th house indicates both the benefactor and the fulfilment of one's
desire. It also shows the success.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the lord of the sub of the 7th house is
deposited in the constellation of the planet signifying the 11th house then,
you can straightaway buy him. But if the significator of 5, 8 and 12 happen to
be the lord of the constellation in which the sub-lord of the 7th is situated
then he will receive the money and cannot or will not oblige you. Have we not
heard of people taking money from one party and voting for the opponent.
Therefore judge the 7th cusp.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="11.8_Air India Strike.html">← Air India Strike</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_12.1_Can I buy him">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="12.2_When is the Marriage.html">When is the Marriage →</a></div></body>
