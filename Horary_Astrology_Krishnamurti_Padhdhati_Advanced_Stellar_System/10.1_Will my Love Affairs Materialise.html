deposited in the constellation of a planet who is the significator of the
houses 7 and 11 then materialisation of the love affairs is promised. But if
the sub-lord of the 5th cusp happens to be in a constellation, the lord of
which is the significator of the houses 6 or 12 then it will never materialise.
If it is in the constellation of the significator of 6, the other party falls
out. But if the sub-lord of the 5th is in the constellation of the planet
signifying the 12th house then the consultant himself will drop the idea.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.7_Will I get Admission in the College.html">← Will I get Admission in the College</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_10.1_Will my Love Affairs Materialise">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="10.2_Invalid Child-will it pick up Health.html">Invalid Child-will it pick up Health →</a></div></body>
