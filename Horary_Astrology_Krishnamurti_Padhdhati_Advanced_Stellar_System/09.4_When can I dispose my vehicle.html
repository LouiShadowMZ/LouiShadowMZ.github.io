</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Purchase of a vehicle is to be judged from
the houses 4, 9, 10 and 11. because 4th house shows vehicle, houses 9 and 10
show enjoyment in this birth due to meritorious deeds done in the previous
birth and the 11th house indicates fulfilment of one's desire.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The number given by the consultant denotes
his lagna. Anybody with whom he transacts is shown by the the 7th house. If the
consultant wants to sell his car, the 7th house shows the purchaser. Houses 4,
9, 10 and 11 counted from the 7th house are 10, 3, 4 and 5. Therefore the
houses to be judged for disposal of vehicle are 3, 4, 5 and 10. Sale offa car
by one means its purchase and possession by another.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out the time of disposal of the
vehicle, one should work out the significators of the houses 3, 4, 5 and 10,
find out the ruling planeets at the moment of judgment, take out the common
planets between the significators and the ruling planets and then calculate the
dasa bhukti period of these common planets and finally pinpoint the exact date
and time by transit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The significators of the houses 3, 4, 5 and
10 are Moon. Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu, Kethu, Mars, Mercury, Venus; so all
the nine planets signify.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To-day is Saturday ruled by Saturn. The
sign transited by Moon is Rishaba owned by Venus. The constellation transited
by Moon is Krittika ruled by Sun and the lagna is Tulam ruled by Venus. Venus
has come twice in the ruling planets, once as lord of Moon sign and once as
lord of lagna. Not only that, the number given by him also falls in Rishaba. So
Venus is a very strong ruling planet. Why should the consultant come to-day to
put his query when Venus is so strongly signifying? This is because his query
is about vehicle and Venus governs Vahana. (It may be to buy or sell). So he
comes when Venus is strongly signifying.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is conjoined with Venus in Meena and
Kethu is aspected by Venus by its 7th aspect. Therefore Rahu and Kethu will
also give the results of Venus. (Node first gives the results of the planet or
planets with which it is conjoined, then the results of the planet in whose
constellation it is deposited, then of the planets aspecting it and lastly of
the planet in whose star and sign it is deposited.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the ruling planets are Saturn,
Venus, Sun, Rahu and Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Of these ruling planets, see if any one is
deposited either in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet. If there
is any. then reject it and take the remaining as the ruling planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">None of the ruling planets is deposited
either in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet. So all are to be
taken. Venus is by itself retrograde. But this does not prevent it from giving
results all throughout. However, it cannot give as long as it is retrograde.
Once it becomes direct it will give,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now check up how many of the ruling planets
are also the significators of the houses 3, 4, 5 and 10. All the ruling planets
are significators. Therefore you will sell your vehicle during their conjoined
period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to dasa-bhukti, Sun's dasa
balance is 0 years 8 months and 11 days from 19-4-1969. In Sun Dasa, Venus
Bhukti is already on. Venus is retrograde at present. As Venus will give
results only after it becomes direct. Find out when it becomes direct. It
becomes direct on 30-4-1969. (So we have to consider the period only after this
date.) Rahu Anthra will commence on 9-5-1969 and will run upto 3-7-1979. Venus
is very strong ruling planet and Rahu conjoined with it is still stronger to
give results. So in Rahu Antrha you will sell your vehicle.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">﻿</span><span lang="EN-US">Moon is the only significator of 3rd house. Third house is 12th to
4th. So in Moon Shookshama, on a Moon star day the car will be sold and handed
over to the purchaser. Moon shookshma runs between 21-6-1969 and 30-6-1969. On
23-6-1969 Moon transits its own star Hasta. The day is Monday ruled by Moon.
The exact time of handing over the vehicle to the purchaser on 23-6-1969 will
be 3:30 P.M. when the lagna is 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Tulam, ie. Venus
sign, Rahu star and Sun sub. (Need not be said that the prediction was 100% correct:
otherwise this article will not be published).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.3_When can I have a Vehicle_ Bicycle_ Motor-cycle or Car.html">← When can I have a Vehicle_ Bicycle_ Motor-cycle or Car</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.4_When can I dispose my vehicle">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.5_Will I sit for Competitive Examination_ What is the
