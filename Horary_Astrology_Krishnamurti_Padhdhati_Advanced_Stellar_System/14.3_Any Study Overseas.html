<body><h2 id="heading_14.3_Any Study Overseas_0"><span lang="EN-US">Any Study Overseas </span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Studies upto High school and College
require regular attendance and study year after year. This is indicated by the
4th house. Higher study is shown by the 9th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9th house also shows long journey, 12th
house shows life in an altogether new environment and separation from family.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether one will be successful in higher
studies is to be seen from the 11th house: If the 11th house is in any manner
connected with the 9th house, success is promised. But if the sub-lord of the
11th cusp is retrograde, success is denied. Ambition cannot be realised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Your query is about study overseas. You
want to go abroad, for higher studies. For any study abroad, firstly we have to
find out whether one will go abroad at all. For this judge the 12th cusp and
find out whether its sub-lord is either retrograde or deposited in a
constellation whose lord is retrograde. If either is retrograde, one cannot go
to foreign. If the sub-lord and the lord of the constellation in which the
sub-lord is situated are in direct motion and if the sub-lord of the 12th cusp
is also a significator of either 3rd or 9th or 12th house, one goes abroad.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out the sub-lord and offer such a
prediction a number 87, within 249, is given and from this number the Horary
chart, cast for the moment of judgement, is given above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this chart the 12th cusp is Karka 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 46</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> i.e. Moon sign Saturn star Saturn sub.
Saturn is not retrograde. It is posited in the constellation of Venus who is in
direct motion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now what is left to be seen is whether this
sub-lord of 12th cusp is also a significator of house 3 or 9 or 12. Saturn is
posited in the 9th bhava. Also, it is deposited in the constellation of Venus,
lord of 3rd house. Therefore you will go abroad. As 9th house, where the
sub-lord of 12th cusp is deposited, indicates higher studies, you will go
abroad for higher studies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also, you will get scholarship for your
higher studies. Why? Because Saturn, in 9th is aspecting the 11th house by its
3rd aspect and the 6th house by its 10th aspect. 11th house shows gains and the
6th shows issue of cheques by a person or institution which is indicated by 7th
house (6th house is 12th to 7th).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now comes the question of finding out the
time of event. For this Guruji has given a most simple, sure, successful and
scientific method-finding out the ruling planets at the moment judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The day is Thursday ruled by Jupiter. Kethu
is conjoined with Jupiter and Rahu occupies the sign Meena owned by Jupiter. So
both Rahu and Kethu are stronger than Jupiter. Therefore take Jupiter, Rahu and
Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sign transited by Moon is Simha owned
by Sun. Take Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The constellation transited by Moon is
owned by Kethu. Take Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The lagna is Makar owned by Saturn. Take
Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore Jupiter, Kethu, Rahu, Sun and
Saturn will give the results. They will give in their conjoined period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu Dasa is already on. In this Rahu
bhukti will run from 7-12-1969 to 25-12-1970. During this period you will go
1969 to 2 abroad either in Sun Antra or Saturn Antra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">How to see whether Saturn is stronger to
give the results or Sun? In the ruling planets always the lord of the sign
transited by Moon is stronger than the lord of the day. The lord of the
constellation transited by Moon is stronger than the sign transited by Moon.
And the lord of the lagna is still stronger than the lord of the constellation
transited by Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So in your case Saturn is stronger than Sun
to give the result. Also Saturn is the sub-lord of 12th cusp and occupies 9th
bhava. Therefore during Saturn Antra in Kethu Dasa and Rahu Bhukti you will go.
This runs from 24-3-1970 to 24-5-1970.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The exact date on which you will go is to
be found out by transit. Sun transits Saturn star Kethu sub in the Jupiter sign
Meena on 25-3-1970. Therefore on this date you will go abroad.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now the question remains whether you will
be successful in your higher studies. For this we have already said that the
sub-lord of 11th cusp should not be retrograde and that there should be a
connection between the 11th house and the 9th house. Here the sub-lord of 11th
cusp is not retrograde. Saturn, the occupant of the 9th bhava aspects 11th
house by its third aspect. Also the owner of 9th house, Mars, is aspecting the
11th house by its 8th aspect. This shows that the houses 11th and 9th are
connected to each other and therefore you will be successful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="14.2_Overseas When_ Dear friend.html">← Overseas When_ Dear friend</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_14.3_Any Study Overseas">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="14.4_Success in Medical Examination and Overseas.html">Success in Medical Examination and Overseas →</a></div></body>
