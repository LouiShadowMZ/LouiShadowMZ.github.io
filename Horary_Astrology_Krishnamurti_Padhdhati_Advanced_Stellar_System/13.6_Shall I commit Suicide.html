astrologer can very well hand you over to such a department which will prevent
you from commiting suicide. Are you a coward? Why can't you face the problems?
Are you not a man? If you want to know whether you would commit suicide
astrologically, the sub-lord of the 8th cusp must be deposited in the
constellation of a planet who is the significator of Badhakasthana or
Marakasthana and also 8th house. Further the lord of the constellation must
have some connection or other with Mars.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="13.5_Will I get money by way of Will from my uncle.html">← Will I get money by way of Will from my uncle</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_13.6_Shall I commit Suicide">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="13.7_Will I commit Murder.html">Will I commit Murder →</a></div></body>
