	<h2 class="block_12">HORARY ASTROLOGY - WESTERN SYSTEM WESTERN SYSTEM</h2>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Many authors have published many books on Horary Astrology. It has been widely practised by great
		scientists and very learned scholars. The western system is explained most scientifically and their arguments
		convince the readers. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">It has already been said in this book that in the western system, the commencement of the zodiac,
		differs from that of the Hindu system; thereby the signs get changed; most of the planets are considered to
		occupy different signs; so, the lords of the signs and the qualities as well as characteristics attributed to
		the signs get changed. The westerners erect the horoscopes according to Sayana system whereas we erect according
		to Nirayana. They do not include the Nodes, while offering prediction, whereas they take Uranus, Neptune and
		Pluto for judgment. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The following extract is taken from the book "Horary Astrology" by Dr. W. J. SIMONITE M.D.,
		PH.D., with additions by John Story and edited by ERNEST A. GRANT. </p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334377" class="block_12">I. The time of erecting a horary figure".</h2>
	<p class="block_4">a. Many disputes have arisen about the proper time for the figure of a horary question to be
		erected. Some think the moment when the querent is first seen by the artist; others when he salutes him, others
		when he inquires of him, etc. But the proper time is the hour and the minute when the querent feels the most
		anxious about the matter.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_18"><span class="text_2">﻿</span><span class="text_3">b. If a person apply to the Astrologer the
			figure must be erected for the minute the querent proposes the question. </span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">c. If a letter be sent to an artist the time of the letter being received is not taken notice of,
		but the moment the artists reads the very questions. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">d. In sickness the time must be taken when the person first spoke to the physician concerning the
		disease, whether the querent is the afflicted party or not. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">e. If a parent bring the water of a child, though the child cannot speak, the 1st house
		represents the child, and not the 5th, and so of the rest.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">f. If it be not a question but a sudden event, take the moment of its commencement, as the
		setting off on a journey. beginning a letter, or any business, etc., or when you first discover the loss of an
		article. In all these cases the first impression on your mind is the time and moment for the figure. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">2. The following extract is taken from the book "Modern Text-book of Astrology" by MARGARET E
		HONE (page 272). </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If the question comes to an astrologer's mind, he casts the chart for the moment of his thought,
		using the latitude and longitude of the place where he is. If a person comes to an astrologer and puts his
		request, the time of the request is taken. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Diversity of opinion exists as to the procedure to follow when there is delay through the post.
		Some astrologers say that the time of opening the letter should be taken, others stating that the querent should
		give the time when the idea came to birth in his own mind. This seems the more reasonable way. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The chart having been cast, the ruler of the sign on the first cusp is reckoned to represent the
		querent, and the ruler of the sign on the cusp of the house connected with the affairs of the question is taken
		as its significator. Judgment depends mainly on the aspect formed between these two, but many minor rules to be
		followed have bearing on this. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The practice of Horary Astrology was very popular in the Middle ages, and its best known exponent
		was William Lilly (1602-81). His Life and Works may be read, also a book of his aphorisms and maps, edited by
		the astrologer Zadikiel (Commander R. J. Morrison). He states that every rule must be meticulously followed, but
		unfortunately he himself begins the book with Tables of Houses calculated for the Placidean System of house
		division and follows by Lilly's maps, all calculated according to the system of Regiomontanus.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As many astrological students have accepted the Placidean system because its Tables are the only
		one easily accessible, and as few realise that Lilly died before this system was introduced into England, it may
		be wondered why Zadikiel did not mention this.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In Horary work, aspects to house cusps are held to be as important as those to planets. This
		presented no problem to most astrologers of the last few generations, since they accepted the Placidean system
		and said their maps" worked". </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mr. LLEWELLYN GEORGE says in the book "A to Z Horoscope Maker and Delineator" in page 569 as
		follows:-</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">One branch of astrology called "Horary" relates to the word "horus" meaning hour. It is a system
		of divination based upon a chart cast for a certain hour and minute, pertaining to a thought, question or event.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Horary Astrology bears out wonderfully the idea of celestial correspondence to mundane affairs,
		exemplifying the sympathy existing between the operations of mind and planetary vibrations. Through the
		positions and aspects of planets chemical changes occur in the human organism which have an important bearing on
		metabolism, and to a great extent determine the anabolistic and catabolistic activities. These subjective states
		lead people to think of and ask questions of importance at times when the planets bear definite relation to the
		origin, nature and termination of the matters involved.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_18"><span class="text_2">﻿</span><span class="text_3">In Horary Astrology very much depends upon
			whether an aspect is applying or separating; whether planets are angular, succeedent, cadent, dexter,
			sinister, etc. A number of considerations not usually employed in Natal Astrology are used in Horary, such
			as collection of light, combustion, disposal of, frustration, reception, refraction translation of light,
			void of course, etc.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To become proficient in Horary Astrology, one should first become very familiar with Natal
		Astrology, especially as regards the casting of horoscopes, local time corrections, the nature of signs,
		planets, houses and aspects.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">This branch of astrology is useful for answering specific questions which arise as the result of
		sickness, accidents, journeys, news, reading a letter, receiving a proposition and other matters which give a
		desire for information regarding the outcome.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Several-textbooks are available for the study of this subject. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">He adds in page No. 629 as follows: ——</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">It is important to know what things are ruled by signs and planets and the places which they
		describe, as the knowledge is valuable in reading horoscopes, natal and horary, particularly.</p>
	<p class="block_4">To illustrate: A lady once said to me, "I have lost an article of value. Can astrology give me
		any aid toward its discovery?" I took the time when the article was missed and made a horary chart for that
		date. As the Sun was in the second house I said, "The article was round and golden". Yes, it was my watch". The
		ruler of seventh house (the thief) was the Moon and it was in the fourth house. So I informed her. "The person
		who took it was a woman and is right now in the building where you reside. She is dressed in white, (Moon) is a
		common sort of person. perhaps a servant or house-keeper; the Moon is in aspect to Uranus, therefore she is not
		young and is peculiar in some ways; the Moon is in Aries, therefore she is of fair complexion; her part of the
		house should be the top and corner room; as the ruler of the Ascendant is in good aspect to Uranus, ruler of the
		second (the valuable in question.) you can recover it by adopting unusual methods". The lady recognized one of
		the maids from this description who had a corner, attic room, was middle-aged and quite eccentric. Instead of
		accusing her of theft the lady said, "I left my watch on the table; I presume you put it away for safe keeping?"
		The woman was speechless for a moment then said." Yes, madam, I took it upstairs and put it on the top shelf of
		my closet where no one could see it". This incident proves the practical value of astrological knowledge.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mr. Zadkiel says in the book, "An Introduction to Astrology" William Lilly and A grammar of
		Astrology" by Zadkiel. Thus :</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">This is the age of enquiry and yet prejudice continues to press down her leaden foot upon the
		neck of examination in the matter. I can only attribute the pitiable fact to the circumstance of there being no
		recent publications on those parts of Astrology which are the most easily acquired. The art of nativities
		requires many years of patient experimenting before it can be well understood and practised with certainty and
		satisfaction. The art of atmospherical astrology and also that of Mundane Astrology alike demand much time to
		penetrate their arcana and a good education to follow their practice. We may account for their comparatively
		confined study: few have either the abilities or the opportunity to wrestle with their difficulties.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">But Horary Astrology, may be speedily learnt by any person of even moderate abilities; and may be
		mastered in a few day's study. It may be well understood and reduced to constant practice in less than a quarter
		of an year, and no one will be at a loss for occasions to test its reality or its utility; for his own
		avocations, and the affairs of his friends will offer these almost daily. He may thus in 5 minutes learn
		infallibly whether the affair will succeed or not".</p>

	<h2 id="id_Toc184334381" class="block_12">HOW WESTERNERS JUDGE A HORARY CHART</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Westerners do not ask for a number, but they erect a horoscope for the moment of judgment and
		they read out results according to the aspects which are being formed (applying) and also the aspects which are
		separating.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Aspects: They do not include minor aspects as they consider that they are not of any
		significance. But they take for judgment only the following aspects. These aspects may be either between a
		planet and a cusp of a house, or mutual aspects between two planets. The aspects which are included are: the
		conjunction; the semi-sextile; semi-square; sextile; square: trine: sesquiquadrate and opposition. When two
		planets have the same geocentric latitude, it is said to be in conjunction. This is considered to be good if
		beneficial planets conjoin. But if malefic planets conjoin together, it is considered to be evil. semi-sextile
		aspect is moderate in strength and it is advantageous. The longitudinal distance will be 30. The Semisguare
		aspect is ever evil whether it is among the benefics or among the malefics. It is of 45°. The sextile aspect at
		60° is considered to be more favourable than semi-sextile. But much less than the trine. The sextile is of 60°.
		The square aspect of 90° is very bad, and very evil. The aspect may be among two benefics or among two malefics.
		Whatever it is, this aspect is very detrimental. The trine aspect of 120° is very strong in offering most
		desirable results. Whether the aspect is among the benefics or among the malefics, or between benefic and
		malefic, the sesquisquarate aspect is of 135 and it is an unlucky one. The opposition of 180° is considered to
		be malefic if either of the two planets happens to be a malefic. But if both of them: happen to be benefics
		then, even though aspect is called opposition, yet the results will be agreeable.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Orbs: In a horoscope (whether natal or horary) the planets will not be always in the exact number
		of degrees as 30, 45, 60 and so on. It is to be remembered that every planet has got an influence round its
		body. Uranus has 7°, Saturn 9°, Jupiter 9°, Sun 15, Mars 7°, Venus 7°, Mercury 7° and Moon 15°.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If one wants to know whether the planets are forming an aspect, taking into consideration the
		orbs, then one has to add the orbs of both the planets and divide by 2. So take half of the sum. If the aspect
		which is to be formed is within the actual distance plus half of the sum (half the orbs of the two planets) then
		they are said to be forming the aspect. The results also should be given as though they are having the aspect
		(applying aspect).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Description of the person</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Please refer to Krishnamurti Padhdhati where the physical features and characteristics of the
		person are given very elaborately in the Ist volume. Also the readers are advised to go through the book and
		note down what each planet signifies and also each house.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">What the 12 Houses Signifies</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">I House: Health, one's mind, physical feature of the consultant; the condition of the ship in the
		sea; Ailment of enemies journeys of children; friends of brothers.</p>
	<p class="block_4">II House: Money that had been lent; one's wealth; Prosperity or otherwise, loss or profit; money
		used in speculation; death of wife and public enemies.</p>
	<p class="block_4">III House: Brother's, neighbours, short journey: letters. IV House: Father, House, Estate,
		Treasure.</p>
	<p class="block_4">V House: Children, their health, speculation, racing, games, music and dance.</p>
	<p class="block_4">VI House: Disease, debt, difficult, pet animals, cattle, tenant.</p>
	<p class="block_4">VII House: Marriage, law-suit, partner, whether the lost property can be recovered.</p>
	<p class="block_4">VIII House: Death. Will, legacy, money of the partner, dowry.</p>
	<p class="block_4">IX House: Safety, Voyage, Church, Religion, Science. </p>
	<p class="block_4">X House: King, Magistrates, business, profession, reputation.</p>
	<p class="block_4">XI House: Friends, hopes, advisors, realisation of ambition.</p>
	<p class="block_4">XII House: Trials and tribulations, depression, fraud imprisonment, secret enemies, deception and
		loss.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When will the event happen?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">They confess that it is very difficult to judge, accurately. They limit the time by taking either
		the house or the sign or by aspect. To find out the number of days, weeks, months and years, they consider the
		actual distance between the planet and the cusp of the house or among two planets and depending upon the number
		of degrees in between their aspect, they predict the days, weeks, the months and years. Also, they include in
		their prediction, in which house the planets are deposited. If the houses are succedent ones, the result will be
		in so many months or years according to the sign, being movable, common or fixed. But cadent houses give in
		months in movable signs; years in common ones and far beyond in fixed sign. South latitude increases the
		duration, whereas north latitude reduces.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">They also take the transit into consideration and from the transiting position, they offer the
		prediction how a matter will progress.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Distance: To find out the distance, they select the planet which signifies the matter. If it is
		without latitude, the distance is short. But if it is in North Latitude, it will be in furlongs whereas if it is
		in South Latitude, it will be in miles. They calculate the number of miles taking the number of degrees and
		minutes between the planet and the significator and according to the distance in degrees and minutes, they
		mention the same number of miles.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn show two miles for every degree. Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and
		Aquarius for every degree indicates two furlongs, whereas Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces denote four
		furlongs for every degree. Therefore, from the number of degrees and minutes, we have to multiply and give out
		the answer. Their principle of judgment depends only on the aspects and the longitudinal distance</p>

	<p class="block_4">Honestly speaking, however, much one may master their system, one cannot give such a clear and
		precise answer as one who follows Krishnamurti Padhdhati. The most scientific way of approach to this subject is
		Krishnamurti Padhdhati and Krishnamurti Padhdhati alone.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">A few examples of the method followed by the westerners will be given, when certain queries are
		answered using Krishnamurti Padhdhati.</p>
