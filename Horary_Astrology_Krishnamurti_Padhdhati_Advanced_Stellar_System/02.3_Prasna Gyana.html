miseries and do harm also; it is not a guarantee that such a planet should
invariably do good. It depends on the lord of the constellation and the lord of
the sub.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Pramudhita: Satisfied, contented: A
planet is said to be satisfied when it occupies its friend's quarters. One can
find out the friend's quarters by using the following:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Swa, Swanthya, Dhi, Dharma, Swechcha, Ayu,
Sukha, L.e.. count from the Moolatrikona sign of the planet whose friendly sign
is to be found. The first, second, twelfth, fifth, ninth, exaltation sign
eighth and fourth counted from the Moolatrikona signs are the friendly signs.
The other signs are said to be enemical, i.e., 3, 6, 10, 11 and 7. One can
easily remember that the seventh and the upachaya Sthanas counted from
Moolatri- kona signs are not friendly ones. The lords of the friendly signs are
called the friends of the planet; the lords of the signs 3, 6, 10, 11 and 7 are
said to be the enemy of that planet. It may happen that one of the two signs
owned by a planet is friendly and the other is enemical.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The authors say that such a planet owning
both the friendly and enemical signs should be considered as neutral, e.g. take
Sun. Its Moolatrikona sign is Leo. Therefore Mercury owning Gemini and Virgo
becomes the lord of the 11th and the second sign counted from Sun's
Moolatrikona sign. 11th is enemical. 2nd is friendly. So Mercury is neutral to
Sun; 3rd sign Libra is owned by Venus which also rules Taurus the 10th sign
from Leo, the Moolatrikona of sign of Sun, Leo. As the 3 and 10 are enemicals
Venus is the enemy of Sun. Take the 4th sign Scorpio. It is owned by Mars who
also governs Aries, the 9th sign. Therefore Mars is friendly with Sun. Thus one
is to find out the friendship, enmity and neutral condition of the planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Such a planet causes contentment; it offers
peace; it is also said that one may have damsels, riches like gems and precious
metals, enjoy one's life and come out successful in one's enterprise and
victorious in the disputes. (Just like friends turn out to be rogues causing
danger to the person, so also planets in friend's quarters offer undesirable
results to many.) </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Santha: Calm, tranquil; If a planet is
in the Varga of a benefic, it is said to be Santha'; by Benefics, one is to
mean benefics by nature, i.e. Jupiter, Venus, Waxing Moon, and unafflicted
Mercury. Such a planet in Santha condition shows that the person will be
helpful. He or she will do meritorious deeds. They will be educated and
learned. They can become advisers and ministers. Hence they can enjoy life with
enough financial position and have peace. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) Saktha: Capable, competent, efficient.
A planet is in Saktha condition, if it is not Moudya, Mooda and eclipsed but is
with bright rays. Such a planet will bring one name, fame, reputation, honour
etc. He will be liked by all. He or she has enough friends of the opposite sex;
so he or she puts on good clothes, uses flower and fragrant scents (not a
guarantee). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) Prapeditha: Troubled tormented. A
planet is said to be in Prapeeditha, if it is defeated by another planet in the
fight among themselves. Such a planet causes separation from close relatives
and friends; he or she may wander from one place to the other (frequent
transfers, keeping the family in any one place); suffer in the hands of the
enemies or from ill-health. Thus he or she will be miserable, even a king will
suffer (not always). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) "Dheena" Unhappy, timid
worried, miserable. planet is said to be in Dheena conditions if either in Rasi
Kundali or in Navamsa Kundali, it occupies its enemy's quarters; such a planet
threatens loss of one's position, prestige and honour. The person is defeated.
He is ruined. He goes to foreign places: cannot keep himself clean (not in all
cases). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(h) "Kala" </span>——<span lang="EN-US"> cruel </span>——<span lang="EN-US"> wicked </span>——<span lang="EN-US">
A planet is in 'kala' condition when it occupies either in Rasi kundali or
Navamsa kundali, the sign belonging to any of the natural malefics, Sun, waning
Moon, Mars, afflicted Mercury or Saturn. Such a planet always contributes for
one's miserable life. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) "Vikala" </span>——<span lang="EN-US"> unsteady, infirm, such a condition arises when a planet is
eclipsed. (Saturn and Venus do not lose strength even when eclipsed.
Uthrakalamirtha, kanda IV sloka </span>——<span lang="EN-US"> 15), loss of wealth,
separation from partner, mentally worried, enemy's strength much greater and
enemy becoming more powerful, agony, etc., are threatened</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(j) "Bheedhi", fear, threatening,
frightened. A planet attains the condition of Bheedhi" in its Neecha,
debilitated i.c., depression sign. Such a planet makes one diffident. There is
no self-confidence. He is afraid by anything and everything. Loss of all kinds
are portended. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(Neecha Banga Raja Yoga: Venus, friend of

work only after bowing to the planets. He must worship, when truth will to dawn
in his mind. Then commence to judge the query</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querist has to sit facing cast or north
or north-east. He should avoid taking such a seat, facing west, south-west,
north-west, south, and south-east directions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Varahamihira in Brihat Samhita has advised
the astrologer to take seat in an even ground under a tree with flowers or
fruits; he has to avoid such trees where owls and such bad omen birds take
rest; the name of the tree itself should be encouraging offering mental solace.
Or one should prefer Deva, Rishi Twiya. Siddha or Sadhu Nilayam with Sath
pushyam, i.e.. the temple, the Ashram of Maharishis. the residences of
Brahmins, the places of Siddha Purushas or good Sadhus where there are planets
with beautiful and sweet smelling flowers etc. Why? The sight itself should be
pleasing to the eyes. Lawn is preferred. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 4: The consultant also should pray
with fruits, flowers, gems and gold; then only, come out with his problems and
put queries to the astrologer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Avoid taking seat under a tree which is cut
or which is thorny. Avoid graveyards, neglected temples, junction of the roads,
dirty places, and dry barren ground. Reject such places where persons remain
naked, or saloon, slaugher house gambling den, hospitals, prison or honey store
room.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Why because one can have favourable results
if the consultant faces east. If he faces south or north, journey is indicated.
South-west and north-east show that there is long delay in achieving one's aim.
North-west and south-east threaten failure, disappointment or temporary
pleasure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Regarding west, in Prasna Bairava it is
taken as auspicious whereas Varahamihira advises to avoid west.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Both the astrologer and the consultant must
prefer the morning hours to the afternoon the Santhyakala, twilight period and
the nights. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Neelakanta suggests that the astrologer
should check whether the consultant has approached him with the sincere idea of
placing his problems and then requesting the astrologer to solve them or he has
come to test him or put some questions casually. This can be judged by finding
out whether the lagna that is rising in the east is occupied by Moon, squared
or opposed by Saturn, or opposed by Mercury or aspected by Mars and Mercury in
moudyam, i.e. eclipsed. If the ascendant, at the moment of query, has such afflictions,
the consultant is not sincere. Benefics in the Lagna Bhava denotes that he is
true and he has the real urge. Malefics in the lagna indicates that he is not
plain and open. If lord of the 7th cusp receives aspects from its enemy or
Jupiter or Mercury he is crooked and not straightforward. But if the 7th house
as well as lagna receive aspects from either Moon or Mercury or Jupiter or by
all of them he is honest when he puts the query. Benefics aspecting the enemy
of lord of 7 when he aspects the latter, then also, he is honest.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Only when the consultant is serious and
sincere, then only truth will come out; prediction will prove to be correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">After satisfying himself, the astrologer
has to note down the various questions, 1, 2, 3, and so on, if the person wants
to consult more than one question. While judging the first question, take lagna
as the first Bhava, for the second question find where Moon is deposited.
Consider that sign as Lagna; for the third question, note the sign tenanted by
Sun and take that sign as Lagna. For the fourth, the lagna should be the sign
occupied by Jupiter; the fifth question is to be answered by taking either of
the signs occupied by the stronger of the two planets Mercury or Venus and so
on. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 5, 6 and 7: In these three slokas the
author says that the astrologer must observe the omen (I add Nimitham then
also) at the time of query and decide whether he can give favourable answer or
not. It is advisable to read Brihat Samhita where Varahamihira has claborately
dealt with "omens.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Next, he explains how one is to judge the
various houses </span>——<span lang="EN-US"> bhavas </span>——<span lang="EN-US">

one's desire or otherwise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 8: If the benefics, Mercury, Jupiter

results if evils do not occupy 1.4, 7, 8, 10 and 12 houses and in 1, 4, 7, 10

occupation of a malefic in the 7th house; one cannot have success in his
enterprises if evils are in the 10th house; but if they are conjoined with or
aspected by any of the benefics, then the malefics do their job by throwing
obstacles and threatening failure but the benefics ultimately fulfil the
querist's desire. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 15: If the fixed sign Taurus, Leo,

also those which occupy the Lagna of query or aspect the Lagna. Those planets
indicate which taste; the person would relish and enjoy. It is indicated by
that strong planet. If these planets are situated in the sign belonging to
natural benefics, one takes good dish. If they are in the signs owned by
malefics, one will prefer dry fruits, dry substances and flat ones. Sun denotes
pungent taste: Moon, saltish; Mars, bitter and hot. Mercury, many tastes
mingled together; Jupiter-Sweet (according to me-flat also). Venus-Sour-Saturn
cold; old; preserved etc. astringent. If the planet is in direct motion, one

Gems (white) pearls, dancing girl dress and white flowers. Mars shows red ones,
corals, bleeding, uncooked meat, gold, etc., Mercury denotes air, flight:
Jupiter reunion with his kith and kin; Venus, travel in the sea or crossing the
river: Saturn, to walk up the hill. Many planets in the Lagna indicate that one
would have dreamt all those indicated by those planets. If those planets happen
to be weak by occupying Neecha sign or enemy's camp, then the dream indicates
some adverse or undesirable results. If Lagna is occupied by Sun and aspected
by Moon or both Sun and Moon in 7, aspecting lagna, show that the querist has
actually dreamt. Note the number of navamsas already passed. From this
calculate the time when one dreamt.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka: (43, 44, 45 46). Rain. Predict good
rain if Venus or Moon occupies the lagna which is either in Cancer-Kataka or

Moon occupies the angular, signs. Kendhra Sthana and natural benefics aspect
them. If evil planets aspect, there will be rain but it will be unsatisfactory.
If Venus and Saturn are in 7to Moon or Sun or if they occupy the second, third,
fourth or the 8th house counted from lagna, and if the query is put during the

high, tall Jupiter round, circular, Venus beautiful and good height. Saturn
hollow and also tall (emaciated wiry). This shape can be used to find out the

Aries or Scorpio owned by Sun and Mars and if these two planets either occupy
or aspect the Lagna, then the query is about some mineral. When Gemini, Virgo,
Capricorn and Aquarius happen to be the lagna and it is occupied by or aspected
by the owners Mercury. and Saturn, the query is about some root or wood. If
Taurus, Libra, Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius or Pisces rises as lagna, and if the
lagna is occupied by or aspected by Venus, Moon and Jupiter the query is about
a living person. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka (54 to 59). If the query ascendant or
navamsa Lagna happens to be Taurus, Leo, Scorpio or Aquarius or if the Lagna is
Vargotama, the theft would have been committed by one of the relatives. If the
ascendant is a chara rasi-movable sign, the theft is committed by a stranger.
If the Lagna falls in the first drekkana, the property that is considered to be
lost by theft will be at the gate of the house. If the Lagna is in the middle
drekkana, that which is said to be lost is inside the house if it is the third
drekkana, the stolen property will be in the back yard. The property will be
recovered back. (1) if the Lagna is occupied by full Moon, (2) if the Lagna is
occupied by a benefic, (3) if the Lagna falls in Gemini, Leo, Virgo, Libra,

Calculate the ascendant rising for that moment in that locality. Erect a stick
in the open ground and let it stand for 12 inches. Measure the length of the
shadow in inches. Same unit is to be taken. Convert the number of degrees and
minutes in the sign in which the lagna has fallen. Ignore the number of signs
passed. Multiply these minutes with the number of inches of the shadow. Divide
by 7. Take the remainder alone. (There is nothing as Zero. If the product is completely
divisible by 7, take the remainder as 7.) </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then Gunakara for Sun is 5; Moon 21; Mars
14: Mercury 9: Jupiter 8; Venus 3; and Saturn 11. If one is the remainder take
Moon and so on. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now, take the product, multiply by the
Gunakara of the planet obtained (by the remainder), again divide by 7 (this
product). If the balance indicates the natural benefics the querist will be
successful in his enterprise. If the remainder denotes a malefic, only adverse
results are to be predicted. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then to note the timing of event, follow
the rule given below. Take the product obtained by multiplying the number of
minutes of the lagna the length of the Shadow and Gunakara. Then take the sum
total of the Gunakaras which is 71. Divide that product by 71. Take the
remainder. Take the Gunakara of the planet obtained previously; in the cyclic
order go on deducting. The remainder indicates the planet. If the remainder so
obtained denote Sun, in so many days, the matter will materialise favourably;
so also predict for Mars. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the remainder indicates Moon, so many
Pakshas- fort- nights have to pass for fruitful results; so also for Venus.
Mercury shows that the matter is successful in double the number of months. If
it is Jupiter in so many months, if it is Saturn, so many years. This is
applicable for pregnancy, income, journey outward and return, success, failure,
etc. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the night hours, there can be no shadow.
So carefully note the first syllable of the word spoken by the querist, if it
is 'A', the lord is Sun if it is Ya Sa', lord in Moon. Ka is signified by Mars,
Ta' is ruled by Mercury Tha by Jupiter, Cha' by Venus, Pa by Saturn. Each
syllable has 4 classes. The lagna will be owned by the planet which governs the
first syllable. If the syllable belongs to planets other than Sun and Moon, the
second and 4th of the class of the syllable indicates the feminine sign owned
by the planet. But if the syllable belongs to the other class, the lagna will
be in the masculine sign of the planet. In the case of Sun and Moon all the
four classes indicate their only sign. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus taking the lagna, one had to proceed.
If one puts. many queries, take the first syllable for each query, when that
query is put. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka: 70. The author wants to oblige his
