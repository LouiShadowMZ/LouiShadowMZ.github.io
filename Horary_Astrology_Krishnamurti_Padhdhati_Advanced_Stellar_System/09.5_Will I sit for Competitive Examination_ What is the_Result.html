18 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In cases of competitive examination the
points to be seen are:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Whether he has the necessary courage to
compete? </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Whether he will be able to appear? and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Whether he comes out successful?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether one has the courage to compete is
to be judged from the 3rd house. If the sub lord of the 3rd cusp is Moon, one
tries to adjust himself in the present circumstances and does not take bold
decisions. If it is Saturn one will be very cautious and lacks in confidence.
If Mercury, the native will be in two minds. Planets Sun, Mars, Jupiter and
Venus as the sub-lord of 3rd cusp, however, give courage and confidence to
compete.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In your case, the 3rd cusp falls in Kumbha
9</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 46' i.e., Saturn sign Rahu star and Jupiter sub. As
the sub lord of 3rd is Jupiter, it will give you courage and confidence to
appear for the examination.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether one will be able to appear for the
examination or not is to be seen from the horary lagna. One may have courage to
compete but may not be able to appear for the examination because of certain
unavoidable difficulties or obstacles like illness, etc. at the time of
competitive examination. If the horary lagna is spoiled due to the deposition
of natural malefics or lord of 6 or 8 or 12, the native will not be able to
make an attempt. If, however, the lagna is not spoiled, the native will be able
to act as he likes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The horary lagna in the present case is
Dhanus, owned by Jupiter. No natural malefic is deposited in lagna bhava.
Lagnesha is a natural benefic. Therefore you will sit for the</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">examination.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For competitive examination the houses to
be judged are 4, 9 and 11. A doubt may arise in somebody's mind as to which
houses be judged for second or third or fourth attempt. The answer is that
whether one is appearing for the first attempt or the second or the third, even
we have to judge the houses 4, 9 and 11. (For child birth me see the 5th house
for the first conception, 7th house-being the 3rd counted form 5th-for the
second conception, 9th house for the 3rd issue and so on. But in case of
examination one should not see, which house for the first attempt, which for
the second and so on.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether one will be successful in the
competitive examination or not is to be decided from the planets whose
conjoined period he is running at the time of examination. At that time if the
dasa, bhukti and antra period governing planets are significators of houses 4,
9 and 11, you will come out successful. If not, you will fail. When
significators conjointly operate then only one will get. Otherwise not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You are appearing for the competitive
examination in the month of September 1969. At that time, according to
dasa-bhukti, you will be running Kethu Dasa Venus Bhukti and Mars anthra. Kethu
is in 9th bhava in the constellation of Sun who is deposited in 8th bhava and
owns 9th house. Therefore Kethu is to give results of both 8th and 9th bhava.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When will Kethu give 8th house results and
when it will give 9th house results is to be decided from the results the
bhukti and anthra lords have to give. If both the bhukti and anthra lords are
to give the results of either 4th or 9th or 11th house, the dasa lord Ketu will
give 9th house results. If either the bhukti or anthra lord is non-co-operative
i.e. if it is not a significator of 4th or 9th or 11th house, then Kethu will
also turn non-co-operative and give 8th house results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The bhukti lord Venus is deposited in the
constellation of Rahu who is in 3rd bhava. Rahu represents Saturn as it is
deposited in the sign Kumbha. Rahu also represents Moon and Mercury because
they aspect Rahu. So Venus will give the results of ownership and deposition of
Saturn, Mercury and Moon also. Saturn is deposited in 5th and owns 2nd &amp;
3rd. Moon is deposited in 8th and owns 8th. Mercury is deposited in 9th and
owns 7th and 10th. Therefore Venus has, along with other portfolios, the 9th
house portfolio also. Therefore Venus will co-operate with Kethu to give 9th
house results if the anthra lord is a significator of either 4th or 9th or 11th
house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now let us see whether the anthra lord Mars
co-operates. If Mars co-operates, you will come out successful. If it is
non-co-operative, you will fail.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars is in the constellation of Saturn.
Saturn is in 5th and owns 2nd &amp; 3rd houses. Mars by itself is in 12th bhava
and owns 5th and 12th houses. Therefore Mars is in no way to give results of
any of the houses 4, 9 and 11 and hence you will be invited to sit for
subsequent examination. On this occasion, your colleagues will pass.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.4_When can I dispose my vehicle.html">← When can I dispose my vehicle</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.5_Will I sit for Competitive Examination_ What is the
