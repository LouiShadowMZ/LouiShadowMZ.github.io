</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ascendant indicates the querist.
Whatever the sub-lord of the ascendant (the planet ruling the sub-division of
the constellation on the cusp of lagna) indicates, whichever matter the sub
lord of the Ascendant signifies, that is what he would like to know. The
seventh cusp shows the thief. The matter lost is shown by the sub lord of the
second cusp. Recovery is shown by the 11th cusp and the time of recovery is
shown by the significators of the 2nd and the 11th houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ascendant falls in Rahu star and Saturn
sub. Saturn is the significator of the 8th, 7th, 4th and the 5th houses. The
7th indicates the thief. The 8th house indicates possession of movable currency
or liquid cash by the thief: the fourth, indicates his profession; and the 5th
house is gain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether the article will be recovered or
not, depends on the sub lord of the 11th cusp. As the 11th cusp falls in 26-32
of Leo, the sub lord is Kethu. Kethu has to cause the results of the lord of
the constellation according to the constellation lord's occupation. Kethu is
situated in the 11th house in the constellation of Sun occupying 10 and owning
the house 11. Therefore the sub lord promises recovery.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When? Find out the significators of the
11th house. Kethu and Jupiter are in 11. Rahu alone is in Jupiter's star. Moon
is in Kethu star. Jupiter, lord of 6 occupying 11, is very auspicious.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Today it is Thursday, governed by Jupiter.
Lord of the star is Kethu and lord of the sign is Sun. Hence when Moon passes
by transit the portion which is together governed by Jupiter, Kethu and Sun the
stolen money will be recovered. This can happen when Moon transits in Sun's sub
in Moola star ruled by Kethu, in Jupiter's sign or Jupiter's sign Sun star and
Sun sub. It will be 3 degrees Sagittarius or 27 degrees Sagittarius. It will
not be on a Friday or Saturday when Moon would be in Moola. But it will be only
on a Uthrashada day. So, on Sunday, the 24th August 1969 in the afternoon when
Sagittarius rises, the money will be recovered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Description of the thief: As Saturn is in
the 7th house, the person is servant. Guide Bonatus says that if the thief's
significator be Mercury he is very young; if Venus, a youthful but yet young
female. Mars shows him to be of full age, Jupiter of middle age and Saturn
elderly people. If it is Sun, he is young if Sun is 12 or 11 or 10th house. If
Moon is the significator, then the age of the thief will correspond to the age
of the querist.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to me the sub lord of the 7th
cusp shows whether the thief is young or old. Also the sub lord indicates the
sex of the thief. Here the seventh cusp falls in 10-26-50 of Aries, The sub
lord is Saturn and Saturn is also in 7. Saturn is a masculine effeminate. It is
in a masculine sign. It is in the sub of a masculine planet, Sun. Hence one can
with confidence declare that he is an aged male servant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to me, one is to find out the
relationship between the querist and the thief.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the significator of the seventh house is
also the significator of the first house, then the thief will be a well-known
person who frequents the house and one who has already created an impression
for honesty. If the significator of the seventh house is also the significator
of the second house, then one of the members of the family ought to have taken
the substance. If the significator of the seventh is also the significator of
the third house, then the neighbour or younger brother or messenger or orderly
would have knocked it. If it is the significator of the 4th also, it is one who
resides in the same house or compound. If it is the significator of the fifth
also the thief would be one among his own children or the musician who visits
the house or the person with whom the querist has developed love or having some
pleasant pursuits. If the significator of the 7th is the significator of the
6th also, it must be the servant or one in bad health or an open enemy. If the
significator of the seventh is also the significator of the 8th house, it is a
stranger notrelated to the person who has lost; or it may be one who is
temporarily appointed or one at times employed at the house, like gardener
washerman, sweeper, etc. If it is also the significator of the 9th house the
thief is a stranger belonging to another land, of a different caste and an
absolute stranger. It may a sanyasi or a religious person in disguise. If it is
the significators of the 10th also, then the thief is one in respectable
circumstances, or some businessman who knows where the things are kept and whom
normally nobody will suspect. If the significator of the 7th is also the
significator of the 11th, it is a friend or elder brother or one whose services
were utilised and who was in the confidence of the querist before. If the
significator of the 7th house is also the significator of the 12th house also
then the thief will be a stranger, beggar, a poor fellow who ever borrows
money, a person in miserable condition, and one who always reveals in stealing
as a profession. Here the significators of the 7th house is Mars; It is in the
constellation Anuradha or Anusha ruled by Saturn in 7. No planet is in Mars
stars. Mars is also the significator of the second house. Saturn is the
significator of the 8th house, the 7th, the 4th and the 5th. Hence it is very
clear that the thief is one who is in the same building moving like a family
member, at times taken as a servant, and moves in such a respectable way that
no one can ever take him to be a thief.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="11.3_Will I be able to clear off loans_ When.html">← Will I be able to clear off loans_ When</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_11.4_Recovery of money lost">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="11.5_Where is the thief.html">Where is the thief →</a></div></body>
