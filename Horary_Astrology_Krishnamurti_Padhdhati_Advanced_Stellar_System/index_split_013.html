	<h2 id="id_Toc184334483" class="block_12">Where abouts of Father</h2>
	<p class="block_4">"Oh father-Where are you? cries this son-having left his house, without any information, the
		father may be roaming about or might have attained eternal rest. Who can say what could have happened to him? or
		if he is alive leading a secluded life, who can credit scientifically except learned astrologers?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To find out the truth, horary astrology is the most correct method as the horoscope of the native
		who is absent or that of the son may or may not be correct.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So ask the son to give a number between 1 and 249.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The son says" 139",</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Erect a chart for the moment at which the astrologer begins to work for the judgment. One need
		not worry about! the time taken to cast the chart if he at once proceeds to work.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Time of the commencement of the working of the chart is to be compared to "Boopadana" i.e., the
		moment when a child is out of the mother in full. Time of commencement of judgment in continuation without a
		break is similar to the child after a few minutes have passed from the moment of Boopadana. Hence one should
		take only the moment when one starts erecting a chart and in continuation offers the prediction. Now it is 7-20
		A.M. L.S.T. on 24-7-1969. Place of judgment 22° 33' North. So, erect a horoscope, taking the ascendant as 20°
		Libra-Nirayana which is the position for the number 139 given by the son (Refer the ready reckoner given in July
		1968 issue Astrology and Athrishta or the book Krishnamurti Ephemeris or Krishnamurti Padhdhati).</p>

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Jupiter and Kethu are in 11, Rahu is in 5 and Venus is in 8.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Rahu is in Jupiter star: None in Kethu's star: None in Rahu star, Saturn is in Venus star. As
		Jupiter Dasa is running, he ought to have left the house during Jupiter Dasa Saturn Bhukthi Kethu Anthra Rahu
		Shookshma in April, May 1963 or Jupiter Dasa Kethu Bhukthi Saturn Anthra Rahu Shookshma in January 1968. Now we
		have to see the transit on both occasions and fix up.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"True, Sir: my father left on 9-5-1963".</p>
	<p class="block_4">"Good".</p>
	<p class="block_4">"Please find out when he will return if he is alive".</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">For any action done by one, the 12th house therefrom is to undo it. Separation came because of
		the significators of 3, 9 and 12 houses counted from the 9th. Therefore take houses 2, 8 and 11 counted from the
		9th. It means judge the houses 10, 4 and 7th counted from lagna. No planet occupies any of these 3 houses 10, 4
		or 7. Owners are Moon, Saturn and Mars. No planet in Moon's star. Sun, Mars and Mercury are in Saturn star.
		Venus is in Mars star. His return will be during Jupiter Dasa Sun Bhukthi Venus Anthra Mars Shookshma, i.c..
		around 4th week of July, 1971.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"How do you take Sun sub-period. It can be Moon or Mars sub-period also."</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"True. Only here the ruling planets will guide you". Now the point which rises in the east is
		Simha-Leo lagna. It is neither Karkata-Cancer, nor Scorpio.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Secondly, the lagna is in Poorvapalguni star ruled by Venus. Further Moon is in Venus
		sign-Jupiter star. Query is to find out the father's date of return. So take the ruling planets. Jupiter Dasa
		Venus Bhukthi, Sun, Moon and Mars Anthra passed away. So, the next date is only Jupiter Dasa Sun Bhukthi Venus
		Anthra,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Also note the transit. Jupiter from its retrograde motion takes direct course in Mars sign
		Jupiter star in the 4th week of July, 1971. Venus will be in Jupiter star Sun sub. Sun will be in Moon sign.
		Mars in exaltation in its own star. Saturn in Sun's star Venus sub. So one should predict 4th week of July. 1971
		to be the safe return of the father.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"So, two more years."</p>

	<p class="block_4">"Can I pray to God, Sir? Will it not help for early return?"</p>
	<p class="block_4">"Whether you pray or not, publish in the paper or not, his date of return will and must be 4th

		Therefore your query should be whether it is possible for you to go overseas and if so, when? It shows your

	<p class="block_4">The 12th cusp is to be judged to find out whether one is promised life in a foreign place. It
		should be supported by the sub-lord of the 9th cusp indicating that long journey is also promised. 12th cusp is
		in 10-20 of Moon Taurus. That star Kethu sub. 9th cusp is in 10-20 Aquarius in Rahu star Jupiter sub. Both Kethu
		and Jupiter are in the third house indicating that one will leave his residence and make journey. Hence this
		number promises long journey and life in a foreign place,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now let us find out the significators to note the time of departure. For overseas one is to judge
		the houses 3, 9 and 12. Third house extends from LEO 10-20 to VIRGO 12-20. In this area we find Jupiter and
		Kethu. Mercury is in Kethu star and Rahu in Jupiter star. Rahu is in the 9th house and Venus is in Rabu star.
		12th house is occupied by Venus and Saturn alone is in Venus star.. Thus it will be seen that Mercury, Saturn,
		Venus, Jupiter, Kethu and Rahu are the significators. When so many planets become the significators there are
		two methods of selection after rejecting the invalid ones.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Those planets which are not in the sub of the significators of 3, 9 or 12 are not useful to make
		the journey. But they will offer other results of the house which they signify.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Also one should note the ruling planets at the moment of judgment. Today it is Thursday. The star
		is Rohini, The sign in which Moon moves is Taurus owned by Venus. The lagna is Virgo governed by Mercury, in
		Moon star Hastha and in the sub of Venus. Therefore one is to say that during Mercury Bhukti, Venus Anthra and
		Jupiter Shookshma you will go overseas. At the time of judgment there were only 6 years of Moon Dasa left over.
		Mercury Bhukti commences on 7-6-71. In that Venus Anthra starts on 19th September, 1971. In that of Venus Anthra
		Jupiter Shookshma will be in the end of October and beginning of November 1971. Hence you are going overseas and
		that must be on 1-11-71.</p>

	<p class="block_4">Studies upto High school and College require regular attendance and study year after year. This
		is indicated by the 4th house. Higher study is shown by the 9th house.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">9th house also shows long journey, 12th house shows life in an altogether new environment and
		separation from family.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whether one will be successful in higher studies is to be seen from the 11th house: If the 11th
		house is in any manner connected with the 9th house, success is promised. But if the sub-lord of the 11th cusp
		is retrograde, success is denied. Ambition cannot be realised.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Your query is about study overseas. You want to go abroad, for higher studies. For any study
		abroad, firstly we have to find out whether one will go abroad at all. For this judge the 12th cusp and find out
		whether its sub-lord is either retrograde or deposited in a constellation whose lord is retrograde. If either is
		retrograde, one cannot go to foreign. If the sub-lord and the lord of the constellation in which the sub-lord is
		situated are in direct motion and if the sub-lord of the 12th cusp is also a significator of either 3rd or 9th
		or 12th house, one goes abroad.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To find out the sub-lord and offer such a prediction a number 87, within 249, is given and from
		this number the Horary chart, cast for the moment of judgement, is given above.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In this chart the 12th cusp is Karka 3° 46′ i.e. Moon sign Saturn star Saturn sub. Saturn is not
		retrograde. It is posited in the constellation of Venus who is in direct motion.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now what is left to be seen is whether this sub-lord of 12th cusp is also a significator of house
		3 or 9 or 12. Saturn is posited in the 9th bhava. Also, it is deposited in the constellation of Venus, lord of
		3rd house. Therefore you will go abroad. As 9th house, where the sub-lord of 12th cusp is deposited, indicates
		higher studies, you will go abroad for higher studies.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Also, you will get scholarship for your higher studies. Why? Because Saturn, in 9th is aspecting
		the 11th house by its 3rd aspect and the 6th house by its 10th aspect. 11th house shows gains and the 6th shows
		issue of cheques by a person or institution which is indicated by 7th house (6th house is 12th to 7th).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now comes the question of finding out the time of event. For this Guruji has given a most simple,
		sure, successful and scientific method-finding out the ruling planets at the moment judgment.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The day is Thursday ruled by Jupiter. Kethu is conjoined with Jupiter and Rahu occupies the sign
		Meena owned by Jupiter. So both Rahu and Kethu are stronger than Jupiter. Therefore take Jupiter, Rahu and
		Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The sign transited by Moon is Simha owned by Sun. Take Sun.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The constellation transited by Moon is owned by Kethu. Take Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The lagna is Makar owned by Saturn. Take Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore Jupiter, Kethu, Rahu, Sun and Saturn will give the results. They will give in their
		conjoined period.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Kethu Dasa is already on. In this Rahu bhukti will run from 7-12-1969 to 25-12-1970. During this
		period you will go 1969 to 2 abroad either in Sun Antra or Saturn Antra.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">How to see whether Saturn is stronger to give the results or Sun? In the ruling planets always
		the lord of the sign transited by Moon is stronger than the lord of the day. The lord of the constellation
		transited by Moon is stronger than the sign transited by Moon. And the lord of the lagna is still stronger than
		the lord of the constellation transited by Moon.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So in your case Saturn is stronger than Sun to give the result. Also Saturn is the sub-lord of
		12th cusp and occupies 9th bhava. Therefore during Saturn Antra in Kethu Dasa and Rahu Bhukti you will go. This
		runs from 24-3-1970 to 24-5-1970.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The exact date on which you will go is to be found out by transit. Sun transits Saturn star Kethu
		sub in the Jupiter sign Meena on 25-3-1970. Therefore on this date you will go abroad.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now the question remains whether you will be successful in your higher studies. For this we have
		already said that the sub-lord of 11th cusp should not be retrograde and that there should be a connection
		between the 11th house and the 9th house. Here the sub-lord of 11th cusp is not retrograde. Saturn, the occupant
		of the 9th bhava aspects 11th house by its third aspect. Also the owner of 9th house, Mars, is aspecting the
		11th house by its 8th aspect. This shows that the houses 11th and 9th are connected to each other and therefore
		you will be successful.</p>

	<p class="block_4">(1) Medical examination means that one medical officer or more than one medical officer will
		examine you before issuing a certificate, declaring that you are absolutely fit, that you are not suffering from
		any bodily informity ог incurable diseases which are unfavourable for the nature of the work you have to carry
		out or to go to a foreign country to work there, etc. (Luckily, such a medical examination is not carried out on
		either of the sexes before marriage. If such a bill is introduced, I am sure many will remain unmarried due to
		congenital diseases like rheumatic heart, enlarged heart, etc.): therefore we have to examine the 4th house to
		know whether there will be the medical examination as you desire; then we have to see whether it will be
		favourable or not! 7th house represents the medical officer whomsoever he is and 10th to the 7th, that is the
		4th house, indicates his job which means yourself being examined; the 11th house shows whether you will be given
		a good certificate to make further attempts.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 4th cusp falls in Aquarius 6° 45' 20", that is, it is in Rahu star and Rahu sub. Rahu is not
		conjoined with any planet but it is aspected by Venus who is the significator of the 11th, the 7th and the 12th.
		Therefore, Rahu as the significator of the 11th will allow you to appear before the medical officer for the
		medical examination. As Rahu is in Saturn sign, you have to appear more than once, since Saturn gives success
		after a few attempts or examination.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Disease is indicated by 6th; danger by 8th: defect by 12th. Here, 12th house is not occupied by
		any planet but Venus is its owner. Therefore, if it all, there is any defect it should be in the vision
		especially in the left eye, since Venus is in the constellation of Sun and sub of Moon: really, there should be
		something wrong with your eye. But luckily Sun, Moon and Jupiter are in the 11th house. Moon is in its own
		constellation and sub it is in 11th; Jupiter is in the constellation of Moon in 11 and sub of Sun 11. Sun is in
		the 11th house, in the constellation of Mars and sub of Rahu. All planets are connected with the 10th and 11th
		houses. Therefore, even though there is the defect in the eye, yet you will get through the medical examination
		and your desire will be fulfilled.</p>

	<p class="block_4">The houses 3, 9 and 12 are to be judged to find out significators for going overseas; and the sub
		lord of the 12th cusp is to be judged to find out whether you will go at all to a foreign land. The 12th cusp
		falls in Sun's star and Venus sub; Venus is in the constellation or Sun, sub of Moon; both Sun and Moon are in
		the 12th house; Venus is to give the results of the lord of the constellation Chandra which is in 12. Hence both
		the lord of constellation and also the lord of the sub are connected with 12th house. Hence life in a foreign
		place is sure; you must go.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As regards the significators of 3, 9 and 12, the 3rd house is occupied by Mars. 9th house is
		unoccupied and 12th house is occupied by Moon, Jupiter and Sun; when you find out the significators, it will be
		seen that Sun is in the constellation of Mars and Rahu is in the constellation of Jupiter and Jupiter is in the
		constellation of Moon; whereas, Venus and Mercury are in the constellation of Sun. Thus majority of the planets
		are connected with the 12th house indicating that you must go.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"Then when?" is the next query.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">At the time of the judgment, Moon Dasa balance is 9 years, 7 months, 2 days. Now Moon Dasa Moon
		Bhukti is operating; in that, you will get pass, visa, etc., during Moon Dasa Moon Bhukti, Mercury Anthra, that
		is after 7th November, 1969 and before 22nd December, 1969; your journey will be during Moon Dasa Moon Bhukti
		Kethu Anthra. Kethu is occupying Sun's sign, Venus star; it is conjoined with Venus. Therefore, Kethu is
		stronger than Venus and it has to give in its sub period, instead of Venus. Therefore, Moon Dasa Moon Bhukti
		Kethu Anthra you must go. That is within 10th January, 1970.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Ruling planets: Today, it is Venus day, Friday, Virgo sign is passed by Moon; it is owned by
		Mercury; star is governed by Moon, and according to the horary horoscope also these three planets are the
		strongest significators and so your going to foreign is certain. You will leave Delhi on 28th December, 1969,
		early morning. It will be a Sunday and the star also Aslesha ruled by Mercury in Moon sign. The lagna will fall
		in Purvashada Nakshatra which will be at the time of Sun rise. According to transit, Sun will be in Kethu star
		Mercury sub: Moon in Mercury star; and Kethu will be in Venus star Sun sign.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus the two members which you have given, one for medical examination and the other for stay in

	<p class="block_4">Number given is 203.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Readers of my magazine know that I would have asked the querist to give a number within 249: Why?
		There are only 2 schools: one to have a number between 1 and 108 and the other to have a number between 1 and
		249. Since the number given is 203, it should be between 1 and 249.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">But, if one consultant mentions 203 when he is asked to give a number within 108, then one need
		not bother to calculate but say at once that the answer is negative to the query which he puts: Look at his
		worry. Absent mindedness!</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The Zodiac is divided into 249 divisions as per Krishnamurti: There are 249 different
		combinations of sign lord, star lord and sub lord. Therefore, cach number has a definite combination. One mumber
		less or greater given has different combination of planets indicating different results. Also each number shows
		the exact position in the Zodiac which is to be taken as the ascendant 203 means Saturn sign Capricorn, Moon
		star Sravana, Sun sub 22° 40' to 23° 20' Nirayana. Latitude in 18° 55'.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore we have to take that for this horary map 22° 40° Capricorn is the ascendant (the
		beginning of the sub). Add ayanamsa 25 20'. Then Sayana asc. x-16° Aquarius. Referring to Table of Houses for
		this latitude, it will be seen that second cusp is 22 25 Pisces; third cusp is 27" 25 Aries; by calculation we
		will obtain that 4th cusp is 26 25 Taurus; fifth cusp is 22° 25 Gemini, and sixth cusp is 17° 25' Cancer: The
		other 6 cusps are 180° opposite.</p>

	<p class="block_4">Research is shown by 9th house and the success in any walk of life is shown by 11th cusp and the
		time is to be judged from the significators: failure and loss or success in a foreign land are to be understood
		from 12th (it will be clarified subsequently). Number given shows that the lagna is in Capricorn 22° 40′. For
		18.55 latitude 11th cusp is in 29 5 Scorpio. It is Mars sign, Mercury star and Saturn sub. Neither the lord of
		the constellation nor the lord of the sub is in retrograde motion. So one is to judge what the cusp promises
		according to the sub lord and the significators. Mercury is in 12th Bhava: Saturn, the sub lord and Venus, lord
		of 9 are in Mercury constellation. 12th house shows failure and loss in the place of residence or fortune and
		success in another foreign place. It depends on the lord of constellation in which the planet in 12 is
		deposited. If the lord of the constellation of the planet in 12 were to be situated in 1 or 2 or 3 or 6 or 10 or
		11, one gains with strangers, foreigners, in another place, in foreign land, etc. Otherwise, one incurs loss,
		wastes time and money.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The constellation lord is Mercury. It shows that one spends time, money, etc. in a place other
		than his permanent place. As Mercury is in the constellation of Sun in lagna bhava it is well spent and success
		is promised. Any planet or cusp in Mercury constellation is also auspicious indicating similar results. Saturn,
		the sub lord is lord of 1 and 2 in 2nd bhava in Mercury star and own sub. Hence Saturn is also good. Therefore,
		11th cusp is under the sway of Mercury and Saturn: They promise luck in a foreign place: Success in enterprises:
		fulfilment of one's desire and realisation of one's ambition.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Then note the significators of 11th house. 11th house extends from 29° 5' Scorpio to 24° 5'
		Sagittarius. No planet is in this area. Lord of the 11th bhava is the lord of the sign where 11th cusp has
		fallen. It is in Scorpio. Hence Mars is the lord of the 11th house. Sun alone is in Mars star. Therefore Sun and
		Mars are the significators of 11th house matters: For research, take 9th house. 9th cusp falls in Libra. It is
		owned by Venus and 9th house is occupied by Mars. We have found that Sun alone is in Mars star.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As regards the owner Venus, no planet is in Venus star. Hence Venus indicates. In Mars, Sun or
		Venus sign there is neither Rahu nor Kethu. But Venus is conjoined with Rahu. So Rahu will give Venus results.
		Time of success will be Rahu Dasa Sukra Bhukti Sun Anthra Mars Shookshma. At the time of judgment Rahu Dasa 7
		years 11 months 1 day had passed. 10 years and 29 days are left over. So, Saturn Bhukti continues till 27-2-69.
		Then Mercury and Kethu Bhukti must pass, i.e., 3 years 7 months 6 days and then only successful. Sukra Bhukti
		comes, i.e., 4 years 2 months from today i.e., middle of February 1970. During Mercury and Kethu Bhukties
		research will go on.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">6, 11 to be successful in election and so on. Thus one is to note that the 11th is judged to find

		to be considered,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Here 9 and 11 houses promise success and they also show that it will be in the middle of February
		1973. In this query, the bhukties which are to run before success are those of Mercury and Kethu. As Kethu is in
		Mercury's sign it will continue to give what Mercury offers. If Mercury has not connection with 9 or 11, then he
		will not do research. Mercury is the lord of the constellation where 11th cusp is. So his attempts to do
		research will be successful in Mercury sub period. As it is in 12, he will do it in a foreign place.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Kethu in Mercury's sign promises continuity. As dasa lord is connected with Saturn, there will be
		honest and sincere attempts. The querist will be plodding, persevering and patiently working. Thus this will go
		on till Sukra Bhukti come. During Venus sub period, one is successful. Mars, lord of 10th cusp also promises
		name, fame and reputation.</p>

	<p class="block_4">For transfer in service we have to judge the houses 3, 10 and 12 because the 3rd house shows
		change of place and short journey, 10th shows employment and the 12th shows altogether new circumstances,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To proceed on leave or to go on tour, the houses3, 9 and 12 are to be considered.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to K. P. the owner of a house is the owner of the sign where the cusp falls. Planets in
		the constellation of the owner of a House are stronger than the owner to give the results of that house. Further
		the occupant of a bhava is stronger than the planets in the constellations of the owner of the house and the
		planets in the constellations of the occupants are stronger than the occupants. All these planets will, how
		ever, give the results of that house, but in a varying degree as above.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Rahu and Kethu are nodes. They are always stronger than the planets represented by them. They
		give firstly the results of the planet or planets with which they are conjoined, then the results of the planet
		in whose constellation they are deposited, then that of the planets aspecting them and then the results of the
		owner of the sign occupied by them.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The query is whether he can expect transfer and, if yes, when? This depends upon what dasa and
		bhukti he is running. One can expect transfer during the conjoined period of the signi- ficators of houses 3, 10
		and 12. The significators of the houses 3, 10 and 12 are Moon, Mercury, Kethu, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Mars.
		Whenever the significators are more in number the best method to select the beneficial ones and eliminate the
		tempters is to find out the ruling planets at the time of judgment. and see which of them are common with the
		significators.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Those ruling planets which are deposited in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet will
		not read the result. Reject them and take the remaining.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To-day is Wednesday ruled by Mercury. The owners of the sign and star transited by Moon are Mars
		and Kethu respectively. The lagna is Thulam governed by Venus. As Rahu is associated with Venus take Rahu also.
		(Kethu is aspected by Venus and is posited in Mercury's sign. But it has already come as a ruling planet).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So the ruling planets are Mercury, Mars, Kethu, Venus and Rahu. None of them are posited either
		in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet. All of them are common with the significators. So you can
		expect transfer during their conjoined period.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mars is by itself retrograde. So it will not be able to give the results as long as it is
		retrograde. Afterwards it can give.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to dasa-bhukti at the time of judgment, Kethu dasa balance was 2 years 3 months 2 days
		from 14-5-1969. The bhukti running is that of Jupiter, Jupiter is not a ruling planet. Then comes Saturn bhukti
		but Saturn is also not a Tuling planet. Then follows Mercury Bhukti. Mercury is a ruling planet. So you can
		expect transfer either in Venus Antra or Mars Antra or Rahu Antra in Mercury Bhakti, depending upon which of
		these three antra lords is strong to give you transfer. Of the four ruling planets the lord of lagna is the
		strongest, if no node is representing it. In case a node represents, then the node is the strongest. Therefore
		Rahu representing Venus, the lord of lagna in the ruling planets, in the strongest and you will be transferred
		in Rahu Antra. This runs between 8-3-1971 and 1-5-1971.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Transit of Sun during the above period will give the exact date of transfer. Sun transit Kethu
		star Rahu sub in the sign Aries on 24-4-1971. Therefore you will be transferred on this date and till that date
		you need not expect any transfer.</p>
