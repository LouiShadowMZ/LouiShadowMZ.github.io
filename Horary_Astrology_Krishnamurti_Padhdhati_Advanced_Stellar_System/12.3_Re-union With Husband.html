Dhanishta. ruled by Mars and is in the sub of Venus. Consequently the sub
period of Venus in the major period of Mars is in operation at the time of
query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7th house indicates husband, marital
happiness and with legal husband. 2nd house indicates family and domestic
facility. 11th house indicates reunion, the cordial relations and permanent tie
with married partner,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore for reunion with husband and
perfect domestic facility, consider houses 2, 7 and 11-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The significators are:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Planets posited in the constellation of
the occupant of houses 2, 7 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) Occupants of houses 2, 7 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) Planets posited in the constellation of

aspected by the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) 2nd house is vacant. 7th house is
occupied by Saturn. Pushyam. Anuradha and Uttarabhadra are ruled by Saturn.
Saturn himself is posited in Uttarabhadra. So Saturn is a significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) 2nd house is occupied by no planet. 7th
house is occupied by Saturn. 11th house is vacant. So Saturn is a significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) 2nd lord is Mercury. 11th lord is also
Mercury. Mercury rules the constellations, Aslesha, Jyeshta and Revathi. No
planet is posited in any one of these constellations. 7th lord is Saturn.
Saturn himself is posited in his own constellation. So Saturn is a
significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Lord of 2 and 11 is Mercury. Lord of
7th house is Saturn. Therefore Mercury and Saturn are significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) Saturn aspects Rahu powerfully. Mercury
is in conjunction with Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the significators indicating
reunion with husband and domestic facility are Saturn, Mercury, Jupiter and
Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The planetary period of Mars is in
operation at the time of query. It is to run upto 17-2-1968. Mars is not a
significator indicating reunion and domestic facility. He is posited in the
constellation Rohini, ruled by Moon and is in the sub of Jupiter. Moon rules
the 12th house indicating separation of husband and Jupiter rules the house
indicating sorrow due to husband. Therefore Mars will not contribute to the
growth of cordial relations with the husband. As Jupiter is also lord of 5th
house, relation with the husband will not be snapped. There is also no danger
to the life of your husband as Jupiter holds the lordship of your
"Mangalyasthana" (8th house) and the 7th lord, Saturn is posited in
his own constellation, Uttarabhadra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From 17-2-1968 onwards the planetary period
of Rahu commences.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether Rahu contributes reunion and
domestic facility?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A planet offers the results of the lord of
the constellation in which it is posited. The affairs pertaining to the houses
over which the lord of constellation holds lordship will be experienced by the
native predominently. The sub will indicate the net result.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is posited in the constellation
Krithika. Krithika is ruled by Sun. And Sun holds the lordship of 1st house.
1st house indicates honour, dignity, glory, comfort and happiness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is posited in the sub of Jupiter.
Jupiter holds lord-ship of 5th house and 8th house. 5th house indicates
recreation and pleasure. 5th house is 11th (permanent tie) to 7th house
(husband). 8th house is your (Mangalyam"). It is 2nd house (comfort from
family) to the 7th house (husband).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore Rahu who is posited in the
constellation of lord of 1st house and who is in the sub of lord of 5 and 8, is
a strong significator indicating reunion and domestic facility. You are sure to
meet and move with your married partner and will have marital bliss and
domestic comfort during the planetary period of Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Sir, the planetary period of Rahu
runs for 18 years. If so, when my husband will meet me and I will have the
pleasure of moving with him", asked the lady quite interestedly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Madam!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What you told is correct. Rahu rules 18
years. Naturally you are interested to know which year, which month and which
day you will meet your husband and move with him with comfort and joy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Our ancient sages have divided the
planetary periods into sub periods and each sub periods rules certain period
which runs a few years. Again each sub period is divided into sub sub periods
which runs a few months.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Planets posited favourably with the major
lord will always help, assist and co-operate with the major lord in giving the
expected result. Planets inharmoniously disposed with the major lord will bring
obstacles and cause delay.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether a planet is favourably placed or
not, is to be ascertained from the longitudinal distance between planets.
Saturn is very favourably placed towards Rahu. Mercury is also favourably
placed towards Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The first sub period in the Rahu major
period is Rahu sub period itself which runs 2 years 8 months and 12 days. The
sub period of Rahu is again divided into sub sub (Anthara) periods. The first
sub sub (Anthra) period in the sub period of Rahu belongs to Rahu himself which
runs for 4 months, 25 days and 48 Ghatis from 17-2-1968.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is a strong significator. Therefore it
is during this period, i.e., between 17-2-1968 and 13-7-1968 you will meet your
husband.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On what date?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets at the time of query are
the ruling planets at the time of fructification of the expected result. The
week day the query is put, is Thursday. Thursday is ruled by Jupiter. The query
is put when Leo is rising in the east. Leo is ruled by Sun. The Moon is in the
constellation Avittam, in sign Aquarius at the time of query. Avittam is ruled
by Mars. Aquarius is ruled by Saturn. Therefore the ruling planets at the time
of query are Jupiter, Sun, Mars and Saturn. The same planets will rule at the
time of return of your husband. The planetary period that will be ruling then
will also belong to these planets only.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The planetary period of Rahu is in
operation. Rahu is a shadowy planet. It reflects the results of the planets
with whom it is in association and also in aspect of. Rahu is in association
with Sun and Mars is aspected by Saturn. Therefore Rahu is to act as agent of
Sun, Mars and Saturn. Thus the lord of the planetary period has reflected the
ruling planets of the query. Sun, Mars and Saturn leaving aside Jupiter.
Therefore the major period of Rahu, the sub period of Rahu, the sub sub period
of Rahu and the sookshma period of Jupiter will offer the expected result,
reunion and domestic facility. It runs between 9-3-1968 and 29-3-1968. The
luminaries are the exciting planets. Sun transits Poorvabhadra in sign Pisces
between 15th March and 17th March every year approximately. The week day will
be Thursday.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore your husband will meet you on
Thursday, 15th March, 1968 from which date onwards he will move with you
permanently bestowing on you martial happiness and domestic facility.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">[It is her luck and destiny. They are now
living together since 2 years.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="12.2_When is the Marriage.html">← When is the Marriage</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_12.3_Re-union With Husband">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="12.4_Will My Husband Join Me.html">Will My Husband Join Me →</a></div></body>
