of astrology does afford mental strength to the feeble and weak-minded, solace
to the depressed, peace to the anxious and worried, and steadiness to those who
are wavering and vacillating in mind. It is a common experience that when
troubles come, they come in battalions and the afflicted person gets solace
from this knowledge that the time is not far off when his or her troubles would
cease to exist. A full-fledged astrologer, capable of handling the subject with
meticulous care, helps in no small measure to dispel the fears in the querist's
mind and braces him up to face the future with confidence and hope. The
astrologer helps one to have a glimpse of the unknown future: the know- ledge
of Destiny in store for one, stands one in good sted in surmounting
difficulties that present themselves. This early knowledge renders it possible
for one to reconcile himself to the situation one finds himself in, and any
severe disappointment is unlikely since one is briefed as to when, one can
cherish hopes and the extent one can do so. When Dame Fortune smiles and the
world appears to be full of roses, few have any use for the science or for the
saying Man proposes and God disposes. With the frowning of fortune, egoism
mellows down, and becomes subdued. The knowledge gained through the Science
helps one to be level-headed under any circum- stances whether affluent or
adverse.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The knowledge of the future prompts one to
render help to those who are in need, banish evil thoughts from the mind and
make efforts to lead a simple, honest and pious life. The saying "Do your
duty with sincerity and leave the result to God holds out a more forceful
appeal. Astrology proves that success or failure depends on our previous Karma;
suffer- ings are due to sins committed previously and this thought helps us to
be good to society, repeatedly saying "It is probably because of some sin
committed by me in the previous birth 1 suffer now; let me not do harm in this
life atleast to any body." </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="01.5_Astrology-available data incomplete.html">← Astrology-available data incomplete</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_01.6_Astrology-its Use and Limitations">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="01.7_Branches of Astrology.html">Branches of Astrology →</a></div></body>
