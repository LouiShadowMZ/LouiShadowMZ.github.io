7 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Going to foreign implies that one has to
leave the present permanent place, make a long journey, cross his country and
reach another. One may return after a short stay or may settle down there.
Permanent residence is indicated by the 4th house. Leaving it is therefore
shown by the 3rd house (12th to 4th). Long journey is shown by 9th house.
Staying for a short time or settling down in foreign land is denoted by the
12th house. It shows new environment and surroundings.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When we judge any particular house, how to
find out whether the matters signified by that house will operate or not. If
one is to ascertain whether one will change his dwelling place, make a long
journey and live in a new environment, one is to judge the 12th cusp and find
out whether the lord of the sub of 12th cusp is either retrograde or deposited
in a constellation whose lord is retrograde. If either is retrograde, one
cannot go abroad. If the sub-lord and the lord of the constellation in which
the sub-lord is situated are in direct motion and if the sub- lord of the 12th
cusp is also a significator of either 3rd or 9th or 12th house, one goes
abroad,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To cast the horary chart and predict, a
number 17 is given within 249. From this number the chart cast with the
planetary position at the time of judgment in given above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 12th cusp in Meena 17</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6' i.c. Jupiter sign, Mercury star and Mercury sub. The sub-lord
Mercury is not retrograde. It is placed in the constellation of Saturn and
Saturn is also not retrograde. Further Mercury is posited in the constellation
of planet in 12th bhava. Therefore Mercury is a strong significator of 12th
house. So you are sure to go abroad.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Going abroad need not be on foreign
assignment. One may go on tour or for honey-Moon or some other purpose. Then
how to know whether one goes abroad on a foreign assignment? If any of the
significators of going abroad is a significator of 6th house also, then one
goes abroad on foreign assignment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury, who is a strong significator of
12th house, is also a significator of 6th house because Mercury owns 6th house
and there is no planet in 6th bhava and also there is no planet deposited in
any of the constellations owned by Mercury. Therefore your going abroad will be
for 6th house matters. 6th house shows service. Therefore you will be going on
some foreign assignment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To ascertain the time of going abroad judge
the houses 3, 9 and 12 and find out the significators. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3rd house is occupied by Sun. Jupiter is
posited in its star. Jupiter and Kethu are conjoined and Rahu occupies Jupiter
sign Meena. Therefore Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu are strong significators of 3rd
house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9th house is unoccupied. Its owner is
Jupiter. Rahu is in Jupiter star. Kethu conjoined with Jupiter will also give
results of 9th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th bhava is occupied by Saturn. Planets
Sun, Mars and Mercury are deposited in the constellations owned by Saturn.
Kethu occupies Mercury sign Kanya and therefore Kethu will give results of 12th
house also.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the significators of houses 3, 9 and 12
are Jupiter, Rahu, Kethu, Sun, Mars, Mercury and Saturn. As the significators
are many in number let us find out the ruling planets at this moment of
judgment because only those planets which are common in the ruling planets and
the significators are to be selected as beneficial ones. The remaining are to
be rejected as they are merely tempters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets are the lords of the
day, Moon sign, star and lagna at the moment of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The day is Saturday ruled by Saturn. The
sign transited by Moon is Dhanus owned by Jupiter. The star transited by Moon
is owned by Kethu The Lagna is Dhanus owned by Jupiter. The nodes Rahu and
Kethu represent Jupiter. Therefore the ruling planets are Saturn, Jupiter, Rahu
and Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The common planets amongst the
significators and ruling planets are Saturn, Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu. They will
give the result during their conjoined period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether your desire will be fulfilled carly
or not is to be decided from the owner of 11th house and the planets posited in
it. Here it is owned by Saturn which indicates delay. Rahu is stronger than
Saturn because occupant is stronger than owner. Therefore Saturn will delay
till Rahu Bhukti commences. In Rahu Bhukti your desire will be fulfilled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu Dasa is already on. In this Rahu
Bhukti will start on 7-1-1971. In Kethu Dasa Rahu Bhukti you will go either in
Jupiter antra or Saturn Antra. Jupiter Antra runs between 4-3-1971 and
24-4-1971 and Saturn Antra from 24-4-1971 to 24-6-1971. Which of these two
Antras will give?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter is already represented by Kethu and
Rahu (dasa and bhukti lords). Saturn, as owner of 11th house, is to fulfil the
desire. Therefore take the period of Saturn Antra. To know the exact date
consider the transit of Sun during this period. Sun transits Kethu star Saturn
sub in Aries on 28-4-1971. Therefore you will go on this date.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether one goes by sea or by air is to be
judged from the sub-lord of 9th cusp. 9th house shows long journey. Whether the
journey-period will be long or short is indicated by the sub lord of 9th cusp.
If the sub lord of 9th cusp is a fast moving planet, the journey period will be
short indicating thereby that it will be an air travel. A slow moving planet as
sub lord indicates journey by sea especially when it is deposited in a watery
sign. In your case the 9th cusp sub lord is Moon who is deposited in Dhanus, a
fiery sign. Moon is a fast moving planet. Therefore the journey period will be
short. Therefore you will go by air.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether one will settle permanently in a
foreign country or come back after some stay is to be decided from the 12th
cusp. If the sub lord of 12th cusp is deposited in a common sign, he will go
and come back. If it is in a movable sign, he will once for all leave the
present place and never return. In fixed sign it indicates that he will not
move out. In your case Mercury is the sub lord of 12th cusp. It is deposited in
a movable sign. Therefore you will once for all leave the present place and
settle permanently in foreign land.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="15.11_Reinstatement-when.html">← Reinstatement-when</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_15.12_Any foreign assignment to me">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="15.13_Business Change of Place.html">Business Change of Place →</a></div></body>
