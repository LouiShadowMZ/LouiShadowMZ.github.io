an unknown quarters is indicated by the houses 3 and 12, counted from the house
indicating that relative.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3rd house is occupied and owned by Venus
but Kethu, a node is in that sign owned by Venus. Hence take Kethu and judge.
Kethu governs Aswini, Makam and Moolam; Rahu, Jupiter, Mercury and Sun are in
Kethu star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th house to the 5th is occupied by
Jupiter; owned by Moon. Venus is in Jupiter's star whereas none is in Moon's
star. So Venus and Moon indicate 12th house matters. Jupiter, Mercury, Sun,
Rahu, Kethu, Moon, Venus are the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">People who leave the house without any aim
or any programme or notice, will be, naturally, going from one place to the
other and hence the 7th house also needs judgment. During the period of and sub
period of the significator of the 7th house and the 3rd house, one will be
making many short journeys and one will be breaking journey on the way. 7th
house counted from the 5th (Leo) representing son, is occupied by Saturn.
Saturn alone is in its star Uthrapathrapada.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now, if we calculate when the boy had run
away, and work backwards it is Moon Dasa Saturn Bhukti Rahu Anthra</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is lord of 12; Saturn is the
significator of 7 and Rahu by occupying Mars sign Aries, denotes 9th house
matters and by being in Kethu constellation and Venus sub, indicates that he
had been moving aimlessly from one place to the other during the above evil
period. It was Tuesday. Rahu star day in Venus sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The question is about the return of the boy
and not about the time of his missing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Judge the houses 2 (family), 8 (4 to 5), 11
(reunion). 2nd house is occupied by Kethu, Rahu, Jupiter, Mercury and Sun are
in Kethu star. 8th house is occupied by Rahu and none in Rahu star. 11th house
is unoccupied, Mercury rules the 11th house and no planet is in Mercury star.
Therefore Rahu, Mercury (Rahu indicates Mars) conjoined sub period will bring
him back, i.c., Mars Dasa Rahu Bhukti Mercury Anthra, ie., between 3rd
November, 1968 and 25-12-68.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Consider the ruling planets at this moment.
Today it is Monday ruled by Moon. Chithra governed by Mars, represented by
Rahu. Lagna is Gemini owned by Mercury. Therefore, he will return in Moon
Shookshma when the lagna is in Arudhra, and Mars dasanatha transits Moon's
position at the time of query, ie., 6-12-68 ut about 6-30 P.M.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">N. B. When one analyses and, judges a
chart, if any one else presents a horoscope, note the ruling planets of that
horoscope. It will agree with your finding. Mr. Gopinath, M.A. (Sanskrit),
Delhi and Mr. Rama Sharma auditor, Vizag., and Mr. K. Ganapathi are in my room.
A highly placed official of a group of Industries came without appointment for
the first time and presented his chart. I asked Mr. Ganapathi and Mr. Gopinath
to write down the nakshathra of the person to prove that the ruling planets at
the moment will agree with the ruling planets of the chart taken (especially
when the query is to know the birth star). Both wrote "Arudhra." I
asked them to read out what they wrote. They said Arudhra. The Officer admired
at the correctness and appreciated how they gave the same star and that too, in
a few seconds.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is mentioned here? To Impress on the
readers how the ruling planets at the moment of judgment give very accurate
results and can with courage and confidence correctly predict when it is Useful
to the querist and advantageous to the Astrologer: Where is tendency or
probably, here.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="16.1_Cure any_ if so_ when.html">← 11 HOUSE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_16.2_Return of Missing Son">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="16.3_IS THERE ANY IMPRISONMENT FOR ME.html">IS THERE ANY IMPRISONMENT FOR ME →</a></div></body>
