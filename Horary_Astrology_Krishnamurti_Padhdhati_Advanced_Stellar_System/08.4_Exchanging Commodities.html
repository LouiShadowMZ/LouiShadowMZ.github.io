profitably" is the question.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It means you are doing transaction with
another. Ascendant denotes you; whereas 7th house indicates the other person.
Whether you will be benefited or not is to be judged from the houses 2, 6 and
11. But if the significators of the houses 5. 8. and 12 were to operate then
that is the time when you have to lose by such an exchange. Therefore one is to
find out which period you are running and if that period is governed by the
significator of 2, 6 and 11, you will make money. But if the period is governed
by the significators of 5, 8 and 12. you must lose.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Horary Astrology please note the sub of
the 6th cusp. If the sub-lord of the 6th cusp is deposited in the constellation
of a planet which is the significator of 6 or 11, you gain. But if it is the
significator of 5 or 12, by so exchanging you must lose; the other person must
gain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Because, when you exchange the other person
had to give you something. Whether the other person loses, or not should be
first judged, so the above rule will reveal whether he will lose or gain.
Similarly also you have a sub-lord of the 12th cusp. If the sub-lord of the
12th cusp is deposited in the constellation of the significators of 6 and 11,
you gain. But if the sub-lord of the 12th is in the constellation of a planet,
signifying 5 and 12, definitely you must incur loss.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.3_Is the report true or false.html">← Is the report true or false</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.4_Exchanging Commodities">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.5_Is Journalism good for me.html">Is Journalism good for me →</a></div></body>
