a string attached to it. For loan one is to judge the houses 2 and 6.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it need not be returned, it amounts to
gift, when we have to judge the houses 2 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence he who can fulfil the conditions and
enjoy the scholarship will have the sublord of the 11th cusp deposited in the
constellation of a planet who is the significator of 2, 6 and 11 and should not
be a significator of 8 or 12. But he who gets the scholarship and then he is to
repay will have the sub- lord of the 11th cusp deposited in the constellation
of the planet which is the significator of not only 2 or 6 or 11 and also 8 or
12. Because, 2, 6, 11 houses show the gain of money by borrowing or accepting
any money given by another whereas 8 and 12 houses indicate return or refund or
lending money to another.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="13.2_Will he be chaste.html">← Will he be chaste</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_13.3_I Will I get scholarship">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="13.4_Will I get any donation.html">Will I get any donation →</a></div></body>
