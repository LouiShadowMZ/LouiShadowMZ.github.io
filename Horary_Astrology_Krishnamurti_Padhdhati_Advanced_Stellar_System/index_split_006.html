	<p class="block_16">By ruling planets, it is meant that a particular moment is ruled by a few planets. That is, one
		is to note (1) the exact position of the zodiac which would be rising for that moment for that locality on that
		day, (2) the name of the day, (3) the constellation in which Moon would be passing then, (4) the sign in which
		Moon would be. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Everyday has its lord as follows:— </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">1.Sunday is ruled by Sun, 2. Monday by Moon, 3. Tuesday by Mars, 4 Wednesday by Mercury. 5.
		Thursday by Jupiter 6. Friday by Venus and 7 Saturday by Saturn. If Rahu or Kethu were to occupy a sign then
		Rahu and Kethu will act as an agent of the lord of the sign.Suppose Rahu is in Aquarius or Capricorn then Rahu
		also should be taken as a ruling planet for Saturday or when Capricorn or Aquarius is the lagna or the sign in
		which Moon passes. Kethu in Leo will represent Sunday. If Kethu were to be in Cancer it indicates Mondays. Kethu
		in Gemini represents Virgo also. If Moon or Lagna is in Virgo, Kethu should be included. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The lord of the star in which the Ascendant rises in the east. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The lord of the sign rising in the east, i.e. the lagna. If a planet owning two houses, rules
		this sign and either Rahu or Kethu were to be in either of the two signs, node must be included. The lord of the
		star in which Moon passes comes next. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The lord of the sign in which Moon is at that time. This lord may own another sign and a node
		may be in either of the two. Node should be taken for judgment. All the above lords are called the Ruling
		planets.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Among these, these deposited in the constellation of a retrograde planet should be rejected.
		Those which are retrograde will cause delay till it is retrograde and they will be fruitful, after they in
		direct motion reach a particular sub. Planets which are in the sub of those who are detrimental to the matters
		of a particular Bhava, indicate when the matter will fall through. Those which are in direct motion and which
		are the significators of the matter under judgment, they give the desired results. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Many instances are given how to judge and how they are helpful. </p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334402" class="block_12">WHEN WILL THE TRUNK-CALL MATERIALISE?</h3>
	<p class="block_16">Consider the houses 3, 9 and 11. Take the sub-lord of the 11th cusp and find out whether the
		lord of the constellation in which the sub-lord is deposited, is not retrograde. If it were to be retrograde, no
		purpose will be served by that call. If the lord of the constellation in which third cusp sub-lord is deposited
		is retrograde, the call will not materialise. If the sub-lord of the 9th cusp is retrograde, the other party
		cannot be contacted. But if they are in direct motion find out the significators of the houses 3, 9 and 11 as it
		will materialise. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Since the call is to materialise in minutes or in hours one need not work out dasa balance, one
		has to note only the movement of the ascendant and calculate when the ascendant will come to the position in the
		zodiac which is governed by the ruling planets and also the significators of the houses 3, 9 and 11. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">A planet which is the significator of 3 should also be the significators of 9 or 11. Similarly
		the significator of 9 also should be the significator of 3 or 11. The significator of 11 should be the
		significator of 3 or 9. Such of the significators alone must be taken. If a planet is not the significator of 9
		and 11 but is the significator of 6 or 8 or 12, one can take it that, that particular planet is not the
		significator for this trunk-call, even though it is the significator of the third house. Similarly if a planet
		is the significator. of the 9 and it is also the significator of 6 or 8 or 12, and is not the significator of 3
		or 11, then the party in the other end will be absent, only when significator of the 9th is also a significator
		or either 3 or 11, then alone he wil[ answer the call. If a planet is the significator of the 11th house and not
		the significator of 3 or 9, but is the significator of other houses reject this planet. Select those planets
		which are the significator of the 11th house and also the significator of 3 or 9 or both </p>

	<p class="block_16">On 21-9-69. a telephone trunk call to Kandy was booked at 9-00 A.M. As it was an urgent call and
		Kandy was about 16 miles away from Matale. I expected the trunk call within an hour or two if the line is in
		order. Before I could get the call I worked out the time of fructification of the call according to Krishnamurti
		Padhdhati.</p>

	<p class="block_16">For the fructification of telephone trunk call, houses 3 and 11 have to be judged.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The third house is occupied by the Moon. Mercury and Jupiter occupy the star of Moon. Jupiter is
		the lord of 3rd. Rahu is in Jupiter star. So the significators are Mercury, Jupiter and Rahu.</p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_2">﻿</span><span class="text_3">The eleventh house is occupied by Kethu, Sun

			Rahu,</span></p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Now the significators that contribute to the fructification of the telephone trunk call are
		Mercury, Jupiter, Rahu, Mars, Venus, Moon and Sun.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The 3rd cusp is in the star of Kethu and sub of Moon.</p>

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">As the sub-lords of these cusps happen to be strong significators, the fructification of the
		call is assured.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">In order to fix the significators which will rule the moment when the call materialises, take
		the ruling planets at the time of judgment-</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">1. The day was Sunday whose ruler is Sun.</p>
	<p class="block_16">2. The star in which Moon was transitting at the time of booking was ruled by Sun.</p>
	<p class="block_16">3. The sign in which Moon was transitting was Makara, ruled by Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_16">4. The lagna rising at the time of booking was Thula, owned by Venus.</p>
	<p class="block_16">5. The rising star in which lagna falls was Jupiter. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">So the ruling planets are Sun, Saturn, Venus and Jupiter.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The common ones found among the significators are Sun, Jupiter and Venus. These planets
		conjointly indicate the time of fructification of the trunk call, irrespective of whether it is a minor or major
		event. As the call will be realised within a few minutes or hours, the transit of the lagna is to be considered.
		So I calculated the position of Zodiac to rise in the East. It can be Venus sign, Jupiter star, Sun sub, Venus
		sub sub. So, as stated above, the rising lagna will be 29° 20' Thula.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The correct time of fructification of trunk call was calculated taking Narayana lagna as 29° 20′
		Thula. The Ayanamsa adopted was 23° 20′. Sidereal time for the Moon at Metale on this date is 11 hr. 59 mts. 52
		sec. When calculated, the result arrived at was 9-41 A.M. So I declared the trunk call will materialise at 9-41
		A.M. only.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">As predicted, the telephone trunk call came through sharp at 9-41 A.M.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334403" class="block_12">FRIENDS' ARRIVAL!</h3>
	<p class="block_16">On 9th February, 1969, a certain function was arranged at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. I was to go
		there with my friend. My friend was expected to arrive before 1 P.M. I waited for some more time but even at
		1-10, he did not come. My wife, being anxious to know whether he will come or not, asked me to predict his time
		of arrival.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Immediately, I took the ruling planets as the significators, and calculated. I found out that my
		friend would surely arrive and it would be around 1-47 P.M. to 1-49 P.M. Why? The calculation is as follows:-
	</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The ruling planets were</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(1) The day was Sunday: ruler was SUN</p>
	<p class="block_16">(2) The star in which Moon was transitting at the time of query was Swathi: ruler was Rahu.</p>
	<p class="block_16">(3) The sign in which Moon was transiting was Libra, ruled by Venus.</p>
	<p class="block_16">(4) The lagna, rising at the time of query was Taurus ruled by Venus.</p>
	<p class="block_16">(5) Rising star in which lagna falls was Moon. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">So, Ruling planet was SUN, RAHU, VENUS and MOON. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The ruling planets indicate the nature of query and time of fructification of query. Lord of one
		in the 11th house promises the meeting, ie., his coming. So his coming to our house is definite very certain
		When, is the question? Since the matter relates only to minor event, which is to take place within a few minutes
		or a few hours, the transit of the lagna is to be considered and I calculated the position in the Zodiac to rise
		in the East. It can be Venus sign Moon star Sun sub. So, I said 1-55 P.M. Then my wife asked why it should not
		be Rahu star Sun or Moon sub.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">I replied "Rahu star is in Mercury sign, Mercury is not one of the ruling planets."</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Then, why not Mrigasira in Venus sign," asked she. I said Mars is the lord of Mrigasira and it
		is not one of the ruling planets. Then she tried and thought loudly Punarvasu can't be as Jupiter is not one of
		the ruling planets. Pushya can't be as Saturn is not one of the ruling planets. So also Aslesha. Thus she
		thought one after another and said "Why can't he come when lagna is in Venus sign. Rahu star, Sun or Moon sub. 1
		said the function is at 3 P.M. Lagna can be in Venus sign Rahu star after 10 P.M. Where will young men go after
		10 P.M.? Not to a colleague's house. So you have no alternative. This is the only answer.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Actually when my friend arrived, the lagna was transiting in the sub sub of Rahu in the sub of
		SUN in the star Rohini ruled by Moon in the sign Taurus (22° 50′) governed by Venus. The time was a few seconds
		to 1-48 P.M. LS.T.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">As, invariably in all cases, without any single failure, using ruling planets one can decide
		correctly the nature of event, and predict precisely the moment, what can one understand. The Ayanamsa given out
		by the Editor alone is correct. If you take any other Ayanamsa, you will get wrong timing using ruling planets,
		judge thousands of cases. Verify then and there. Not only ruling planets are very useful to offer correct
		prediction, but also this proves beyond doubt that Krishnamurti Ayanamsa is alone very very correct and any
		other figure used is never correct. Ayanamsa or any problem is not a vexed one, if intelligent research workers
		with open mind, forgetting the number of years of so-called experience in wrong lines, honestly work. Solution
		comes. A boy calls that he has more than 3 years' experience in one particular class, say, VIII Standard. For
		the fourth year, he studies in the same class. Another talented boy comes and joins in that class. The
		longstanding student again fails: The new entrant scores distinction, bags prizes and is respected and regarded.
		Similarly K. P. followers win the appreciation of the consultants by offering uncanny predictions; credit goes
		to my intelligent students making correct calculations and honest attempts. There is nothing as Tendency, You
		may desire to have anything in a few minutes. You can get only at the time predicted by K. P. K. P. unfolds the
		destiny correctly.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334404" class="block_12">When will the servant sent to the bank, return after cashing the cheque?
	</h3>
	<p class="block_16">As the native is to receive the cash, judge the second house. Since he is a servant, consider
		the sixth house. If he knocks away and does not return, the 12th house will indicate. If he returns, it will be
		a reunion and also the legitimate gain of cash which is your desire. So include the eleventh house.. Therefore
		one is to judge the houses 2, 6 and 11. This is to calculate on a number given or chosen and work out to find
		the time of the return of the messenger</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">When the urge is there, note the ruling planets and find out when that position of the Zodiac
		will rise in the cast for that locality on that day, which is governed by the ruling planets.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">A cashier sent a messenger to the treasury to get the cash. The messenger left the office at
		11-00 A.M. on 13th December, 1968. The day was a Friday. Star was Uthirapalguni Rasi was in Virgo. The lagna
		fell in Aquarius. Hence the Ruling planets are Venus, Sun, Mercury and Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">On that day the signs which are to rise are Pisces owned by Jupiter; Aries governed by Mars and
		then Taurus, the lord of which is Venus. As Jupiter and Mars are not the ruling planets reject those signs. Then
		consider the sign Taurus owned by Venus. There is no Saturn star in Taurus; no Mercury star in Taurus; but there
		is the Sun's star, Karthik. Hence Taurus sign and Sun star: 0° degree Taurus to 10 degree Taurus. In that, we
		have to take the sub-lord. As Saturn is the lord of lagna at the time of judgment and Mercury is the lord of the
		sign where Moon was, and since the lord of the lagna is stronger than lord of the rasi, take the sub of Saturn
		and sub sub of Mercury. That is 3° 30' must rise in the cast to Madras on that day. After calculations it was
		found that the messenger would return exactly at 4 P.M.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Actually he returned at 4 P.M. instead of 2 P.M. at which time he used to return. This
		calculation offers peace of mind to the accountant between 2 and 4 P.M.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334405" class="block_12">Child's return from school</h3>
	<p class="block_16">To find out the correct time, note the ruling planets at the time of judgment. Find out the sign
		which is rising and which is to rise next and so on. Then that sign which is governed by one of the ruling
		planets should have the star governed by another ruling planet. In that you have to find out the sub-lord of
		which is one of the ruling planets. When this position in that sign would rise in the east, the girl will
		return.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">You also ask for a number to be given by the mother of the child. Erect the horoscope having the
		ascendant at the position as indicated by the number of the mother. Note the 11th cusp. If the sub-lord is
		deposited in the constellation of a planet in retrograde motion, the child will not return home. But if the
		sub-lord is in direct motion, note the significators of the 5th and the 11th houses. Find out which position of
		the zodiac is governed by the significators. Calculate when it would rise in the east. That will be the time
		when the child will return home.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334406" class="block_12">Railway receipt received. Parcel not yet come. When?</h3>
	<p class="block_16">Note the time when the urge is there to find out the time of taking delivery. Immediately work
		out as follows. What are the ruling planets then? Find out the position of the zodiac, from the position of the
		Sun at the time of judgment.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">As this question suggest that it should be received in a few days, the motion of the Sun is to
		be noted. The Moon must reach the position governed by the ruling planets conjointly. Need not be New Moon; 2 or
		3 positions in the Zodiac are ruled by the same group of planets. Reject those ruling planets situated in the
		constellation of the retrograde planets. Select those deposited in the constellation of the planets in direct
		motion. Note from the sign occupied by Moon and be proceeding. When it touches that position in a sign, star and
		sub-lords of these being the ruling planets tenanted in the constellation of planet in direct motion; Similarly,
		note the Sun's position. The parcel will be received and taken delivery.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">A person may receive advice from a foreign land saying that the machinery had been shipped. Yet
		one would like to know when it would be received. The above method is to be followed. Similarly if one wants to
		know the moment when the astronauts will return after landing in the Moon, the method is the same. Hence the
		principle remains the same, Ruling planets will reveal the truth.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">N.B.-If a matter is to be materialised in days and within a month you take the position of Moon
		and therefrom you calculate. But if it would take more than a month, move the Sun from the present position of
		the Sun. If the matter is to fructify in some years move Jupiter from the position occupied by Jupiter at that
		time. If one asks which month I can celebrate the marriage of my daughter in that year, Sun must reach the
		position governed by the Ruling planets. But if one asks in which year one will build a house, move Jupiter. If
		one wants to know when his fever will subside move Moon. If one wants to know when his wife would deliver and
		adds that it is the fourth month, then move the Sun. If it is the same month for delivery, move Moon: If
		expected on the same day, take lagna. If one says that one would like to start a business in a few years, then
		move Jupiter. This is the way how one is to make the best and most correct method of using the Ruling planets.

	<p class="block_16">On 15-9-69, friends at office had gathered together at 9-06 A.M. It was a time for redicule and
		laughter as the prediction appeared to have failed. It was predicted that certain dangerous drugs could come on
		13-9-'69 at 2-39 P.M. Prediction was given on 13-9-69 at 1-15 P.M. K. P. was applied with full confidence. These
		drugs were expected from Colombo. The morning train from Colombo which brings mails and parcels had come but the
		drugs did not come. The railway station and the postoffice were contacted and it was a disappointment. There
		were no reasons to expect the drugs on this day any more and thus a critical situation was created. Action was
		taken so that they reach our hands at least on 16-9-'69,</p>

	<p class="block_16">The drugs arriving at the institution means reaching the correct destination or place. So one is
		to take the 4th house and find out the ruling planets. It is the wish of one and all including the patients to
		receive the drug in time. So include the 11th house. So consider the houses 4th and 11th.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The fourth house is vacant. Jupiter is the lord of 4th and aspects its own house. Rahu is in the
		star of Jupiter. So Rahu and Jupiter are significators.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">My Guruji says that significators show chances of success, and whether they are promised or not
		are found from the sub- lord of the respective cusps. The 4th cusp is in the star of Saturn and sub Jupiter. The
		11th cusp is in the star of Rahu and sub Kethu. In this case, it promises success in receipt of drugs. As it is
		expected within a few days, consider the transit of Sun. He is in Simha and does not transit in any star of any
		of the significators. So consider the transit of Moon. She will transit in the sign of Venus (Thula), star of
		Rahu and sub Jupiter within a few days. Further, it is found that she transits. on 15-9-'69 (in Thula) in Rahu
		star, Jupiter sub and Venus Anthra.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Planets posited favourably with the major lord will always help, assist and co-operated with the
		major lord in giving the expected result. Planets inharmoniously disposed with the major lord will bring
		obstacles and cause delay.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">So for another lord, the immediate major lord is the bukthi lord. As such, consider the
		positions of Venus and Saturn. Venus is better disposed than Saturn to the bukthi lord Jupiter, as it is in the
		11th while Saturn is in the 8th from Jupiter. So in Saturn Anthra, the drugs may come but will not come to hand.
		In Venus Anthra, it will come to hand. So the drugs will be had when Moon is in the star of Rahu, sub of Jupiter
		and sub sub of Venus, i.e., 9° 32' 28" Thula, and the correct time will be 2-39 P.M.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Lastly, I checked up with the ruling planets too, at the moment of query. The day was 13-9-'69
		Saturday. ruled by Saturn, and Rahu acts as Saturn's agent being in its sign. The lord of lagna was Jupiter,
		Moon was transitting in its own star in Kanya. All these satisfied me in arriving at the conclusion and the day
		of receipt would be Monday (15-9-69) ruled by Moon. So like a school boy. I was expecting to see the result at
		2-39 P.M. I was hoping against hopes. The hour was approaching closer and still there was confidence to check up
		the result. At 2-30 P.M. I personally went to the railway station and was disappointed. In the meantime, the
		administration unit was informed by the postal authorities of receipt of three registered parcels addressed to
		the Head of our Institution. They promptly took action and when those parcels came to my hand checking and
		necessary action; the time was 2-39 PM. sharp. It was a wonderful experience and the prediction was very very
		correct. Later, on inquiry, I found that these parcels were delayed at Kandy on changing them from one train to
		another.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">All my friends were stunned at this incident and the correct prediction. This perfectness was
		due to Prof. K. S. Krishna- murti's fruitful research and his system of advanced Stellar Astrology.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334408" class="block_12">TRAIN RUNNING LATE: TRACK DAMAGED: WHEN WILL IT REACH HOME?</h3>
	<p class="block_16">I. It is necessary to note whether we will reach our home at all. So, we have to find out the
		sub-lord of the 4th cusp. If the sub-lord of the 4th cusp is in the constellation of a planet in a movable sign
		and unafflicted, we will reach the destination shortly. But if the lord of the constellation in which the sub-
		lord of the 4th cusp is in a fixed sign, the passengers may have to stay in a place for long duration. But if
		the lord of the constellation in which the sub-lord is deposited, is in a common sign, then there will be delay.
		If the sub-lord is afflicted by a natural malefic like Saturn there will be undue delay and also the passengers
		have to undergo much of sufferings. If it is Mars or Rahu, some repairs also may be needed. But if the lord of
		the constellation in which the sub-lord of the 4th is deposited, is conjoined with a benefic, then after delay
		we will reach our home safe. If the question is whether we will make a journey, we have to judge the 3rd house.
		So, for this question we have to judge primarily house 4 and then the house 11.</p>

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Arriving at Madras means reaching home. So one is to take the 4th house and find out the ruling

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Find out the significators. Fourth house extends from Cancer 10° 9′ to Leo 6° 9′. No planet is

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The 4th cusp falls in 10° 9'. It means it is in Venus sub; the lord of the constellation in

		conjunction or aspect.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Therefore, reaching home safe is promised. Let us find out when?</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Then the point in the Zodiac to rise in the east, at the time of arrival at Madras should be
		Moon sign Mercury star Kethu sub. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Why ?</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Moon fulfils the desire. It has only one sign. Mercury and Sun are in the constellation of lord
		of 4. There is no Sun's star, nor Kethu's star (Kethu represents Mercury) in Cancer. There is only Mercury star.
		So the lagna at Madras on 30-5-69 should be above 16° 49 Cancer-Nirayana, i.e., 10° 00' Leo Sayana.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(If one goes by air to another country and a city therein, then to the place of destination one
		is to find the time when such a position in the Zodiac would rise. 10 Leo Sayana is rise at 13 North and 80.15
		E.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">It will be 10 hrs. 15 mts. A.M. I.S.T. on 30-5-69.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">"Why should it not be 10-15 A.M. today?" If some one asks, we have to reply it is the train by
		which we travel. Hundreds of miles cannot be covered in 4 hours. We should use commonsense. Scientifically the
		Moon at the moment of query is in Libra owned by Venus and the Ascendant is in Taurus owned by the Venus. So day
		of arrival can be Friday.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Why should it not go on Saturday, another 24 hours later? Saturn is neither a ruling planet nor
		a significator. So, Friday 30-5-69 at 10-15 A.M. must be the time.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Readers will be pleased to understand that G. T. which left Delhi on 27-5-69 reached Madras on

	<h3 id="id_Toc184334409" class="block_12">Correct time of birth</h3>
	<p class="block_16">Nowadays, even though we have got watches, clocks and learned medical attendants to attend upon
		the labour case and note down the exact time of the birth, yet the parents fail to keep a record of the correct
		time of the birth in many cases. Further, nowadays, there are many refugees who had left their belongings in the
		countries where they were and had come here: a few lost their parents during the disturbance; most of them lost
		their horoscopes. Therefore, it is not possible to know the correct time of the birth, even though they may be
		knowing the date of birth. To find birth time, there are various rules given in Hindu Traditional System: the
		Westerners follow pre-natal epoch. All these methods are useless for such customers. Only the ruling planets at
		the moment of judgment will be useful and innumerable instances are given in the magazine "Astrology &amp;
		Athrishta ".</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Procedure: Note the constellation in which the lagna at the moment of judgment falls; then the
		lord of the sign where the ascendant is find out in which constellation, Moon is passing and know the lord of
		the constellation and lord of the rasi. You should, for astrological purposes, take that sunrise to next sunrise
		is a Day. Therefore, know the lord of the day. Hence these five planets happen to be the ruling planets.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Write down all these ruling planets. Note which are deposited in the constellation of the
		planets in retrograde motion. Reject them. Then take those planets which are in the constellation of the planets
		in direct motion. You have to select the ascendant. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">It will fall in a sign and in that in a star and in that star in a sub and in that sub in a sub
		sub. The lords of all these must agree with the ruling planets at the moment of judgment.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">If you get some three positions in the Zodiac, you enquire the consultant whether he was born in
		the morning or day time or night; according to the date of birth find out in which sign he could have been born.
		Then in that sign select the constellation and sub governed by the ruling planets. Then, this is the exact
		position of the lagna.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Above rule had been tested by most intelligent students, highly qualified, very well placed in
		life who used to put the query in the class and used to ask the correct time of their birth.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Already they know their correct time; but to ascertain whether this method works out correctly
		hundreds and hundreds of the students have tested, verified and were very happy. Readers will be pleased to
		understand that everywhere I came very correct. They were also very much impressed, convinced and absolutely
		satisfied. I had already published in the magazine "Astrology &amp; Athrishta" how without seeing the native I
		had given the correct time of birth, the nakshathra of birth, the rasi of birth, etc., to the interested party
		who had the real urge. I had not tested only with people who are not known to many, but with people holding such
		a position which will be even to-day from 1 to 10, in India. Therefore, the above method alone is to be followed
		to find out the correct time of birth and also correct position of one's lagna.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">A gentleman says that he is born between 4-30 and 5-30 A.M. on 16-10-1919 at 21° 7 N 73 40 E. He
		wants to know the correct time of birth.</p>

	<h3 id="id_Toc184334411" class="block_12">Correct date and time of birth</h3>
	<p class="block_4">A very influential and powerful politician wanted to know his date of birth. He fixed the time of
		meeting as 8-15 P.M. I.S.T. on 9-10-1967. He cannot afford to give interview to any, for more than 5 mts. So, I
		worked out the lagna for 8-15 P.M. on 9-10-1967 at Delhi. It was in Sun’s star in Taurus at 6°. As the day is
		Monday and he has fixed this day, Moon must be his ruling planet and not Sun as on Sunday even though he wanted,
		I could not meet him, as I was in Kanpur on 8-10-67. So I worked out that I could meet him only after Rohini
		(ruled by Moon) rises in the East for Delhi on 9-10-1967. Then, I said to his Private Secretary, that I could
		see the gentleman only when Rahu sub rises in the East as Rahu in Aries denotes his present portfolio. As
		sidereal time at noon at Greenwich on 9-10-1967 was 13 hours 9 minutes 40 secs. and Krishnamurti Ayanamsa was
		23° 18', I said that I would meet him only at 8-37 P.M. even though he has given the time as 8-15 P.M. Mr. Sun-
		daram, one of the intelligent and learned students, of Astrology who accompanied me noted down the time, 8-37
		P.M. and gave it to the Private Secretary. Readers are assured that our watches were at once set right by
		dialling No. 174.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Actually, he called at 8-37 P.M. and we met only then on 9-10-1967.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So the ruling planets are Venus, Moon and Rahu. Here we should take Kethu, instead of Venus, as
		Moon is in Kethu star Moolam. Jupiter also is a ruling planet.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When one asks the date, one should take the position of Sun (a) Sun must be in Venus sign, Moon
		star, Mars sub, 117 in Taurus. As the year is given as 1913, the date should be 26th May, 1913. This gentleman
		was informed by his parents, that he was born around sunset. So take the lagna in Mars sign, Jupiter star, Rahu
		sub and Venus sub sub, i.c., 3° Scorpio, Nirayana 25° 33′ Scorpio i.e., 10° 1′ Sidereal time at birth. Sidereal
		time at noon was 4 hours 13 mts. 48 secs. Hence time of birth in L.M.T. after deducting correction for interval
		between noon and birth time at 10 secs per hour is 5 hours 46 mts. 14 secs. L.M.T. As the place of birth is 74°
		E. time of birth would be 6 hours 10 mts. 14 secs, I.S.T. P.M.</p>

	<p class="block_4">The chart is as above:-</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mars Dasa balance 6 years 1 month 18 days.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334412" class="block_12">STRENGTH OF PLANETS</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Western: Westerners consider that a planet situated in its own sign is the strongest. The signs
		are in Sayana system. Next in strength is the essential dignity i.c., exaltation. According to them Sun in 19
		deg. in Aries, Moon in 3rd deg. Taurus, Mars in 28 Capricorn, Mercury in 15 in Virgo, Jupiter in 15 in Cancer,
		Venus in 27 in Pisces Saturn in 21 in Libra and Rahu in the 3rd in Gemini and Kethu in the 3rd degree in
		Sagittarius. What we call as debilitation or neecha, they call as FALL and hence these planets are debilitated
		in the opposite signs of their exaltation ones. They consider that a planet is very powerful in the elevated
		position. Meridian is the most elevated one. They term a planet in its own sign as Domal dignity. Detriment is
		the term used when a planet is in a sign opposite to its own. They have nothing as Moolatrikona, Shadbala,
		Ashtakavarga etc.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If a planet is dignified, it will manifest good qualities whereas planets without dignity will
		manifest the lower side of the nature. They give importance more to the aspect than these dignities.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hindu system: They have their method of calculating the sixfold strength of a planet to ascertain
		whether it is strong and do good to the native. They are Kalaja, Chesta, Uchchaja, Dik, Ayana and Sthana. Also
		it is said that Moon, Mars and Venus are strong if the birth were to be in the night hours; Mercury always; the
		other planets are strong if the birth was in the day time.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Moon is said to be strong when it is full, i.c., waxing Moon. Sun is strong when he is in
		Northern course; other planets when they are retrograde.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun and Mars are strong in the tenth house. Moon and Venus are strong in the 4th house. Mercury
		and Jupiter are strong in the ascendant. Saturn strong in the 7th. Moon, Mercury and Saturn are strong in the
		southern course and the others. in the northern course. A planet is strong if it is retrograde or if it is full
		and not eclipsed, even though it is debilitated or deposited in enemy's quarters. If a planet is eclipsed, it
		loses all its strength, irrespective of it being exalted etc. Thus the Hindus have various rules to calculate
		the strength of the planet.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hindus are of opinion that strong planets will offer invariably advantageous results, whereas
		those who have little strength will do harm. In practice, it is found to be ABSURD. Are there not people born in
		Cancer Ascendant having Jupiter exalted in the ascendant suffered during Jupiter Dasa? Are there not people born
		in Aries having Saturn in 7 met with only difficulties, disgrace and disappointment? Therefore the nature of the
		result need not be desirable simply because a planet is strong. Further there are many other rules: amendments.
		An exalted planet if retrograde it loses strength. An exalted planet if debilitated in Navamsa it loses strength
		and vice versa. A debilitated planet if retrograde gains strength. If debilitated in Rasi but exalted Navamsa it
		gains strength.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In K. P. no such confusion or thousands of rules. Natal Horoscope:-</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In a Natal chart, do not worry whether a planet is in direct motion or retrograde. There is no
		difference. Retrograde planets neither loses strength nor they are harmful. If one takes the horoscopes of those
		born in March, April and May, 1922, they had Rahu, Jupiter and Saturn in Virgo. They were retrograde. People
		born in the stars of Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars and Rahu had the dasas of Jupiter following Rahu and then Saturn.
		They lived long. They had education, they had their marriage, birth of children, purchase of car, house, etc.
		They enjoyed the fruits of life in this world. Have the retrograde planets denied because they were retrograde.
		No. Not at all. There is nothing as exaltation becoming auspicious and debilitation inauspicious.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In K. P. (a) if a planet is exalted but is in the constellation of a planet in debilitation, the
		extent to which it can do either good or bad is limited. A container (the planet) may be big but the content is
		a cheap affair (lord of the constellation is the content) like cotton bundle. But a debilitated planet (small
		packet) in the constellation of a planet in exaltation (costly gems) is similar to diamond in a small packet.
		The lord of the constellation is to be considered as one representing the value of the content. The container is
		the planet which is deposited in a constellation.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334413" class="block_12">Retrograde-Horary chart</h3>
	<p class="block_4">In Horary horoscope, planets in retrograde motion, if deposited in the constellation of a planet
		which is in direct motion indicates that after some obstacle and delay, the matter will materialise, when it is
		indirect motion and passes beyond the point wherefrom retrograde motion started,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">But planets in retrograde if deposited in the constellation of another retrograde planet or in
		its own when retrograde, promises only failure. Never success.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Planets in direct motion if deposited in the constellation of a retrograde planet, one cannot
		have success (For retrograde motion take only Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn Rahu and Kethu should not
		be considered as retrograde, as these two nodes never appear to retrace the path travelled by them. When all
		planets, in direct motion moves in one direction Rahu and Kethu move in the opposite direction. But they do not
		take such a direction by which the Sun or Moon ever travel.)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If one wants to know whether he could marry a girl in view and if the sub-lord of the 7th cusp is
		in direct motion but the lord of the constellation is retrograde he cannot marry her. It does not mean that he
		will never marry. If one wants to know whether marriage is promised at all and if the sub-lord of the 7th cusp
		is retrograde and it is deposited in the constellation of a retrograde planet, he can never marry at all. If a
		planet is the significator of 2 or 7 or 11 and it is deposited in the constellation of a retrograde planet
		whether it is in direct motion or retrograde,that planet cannot give marriage in its period or sub-period. His
		vote is invalid in the election. If one wants to know whether he can divorce one; if the significator of 1 or 6
		or 10 were to be in the constellation of a planet in retrograde motion he can't divorce her. If one courts
		imprisonment and if the significator of the houses 3 and 12 are deposited in the constellation of a planet in
		retrograde motion, he will not be arrested, in its period and sub-period. But another significator of 3 and 12
		whether it is retrograde or direct will give him prison life in its period if this significator is in the
		constellation of a planet in direct motion.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If one wants to know whether he will win in the races, or in the competition, or litigation or
		election, if the significator of the houses 6 and 11 is deposited in the constellation of a retrograde planet he
		cannot win in the period and sub-period of that planet: but later when the significator of 6 and 11, in direct
		or retrograde motion deposited in the constellation of one in direct motion, rules, during its period and
		sub-period he will win.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334414" class="block_12">ECLIPSE ECLIPSED PLANET-RESULTS</h2>
	<p class="block_4">If any heavenly body intercepts the light of another heavenly body and the onlooker is unable to
		see the farther off planet it is said to be eclipsed. The nearer planet deprives the light of the more distant
		planet. Its brilliance, the circular shape and splendour will be lost.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In the Solar system, Sun is taken as the Central body around which the planets move round and
		round. Each planet has its own orbit-its own pathway round the Sun. But the earth and the Moon go round the Sun,
		together. The one feature of Moon which is about 2,40,000 miles away from the earth goes round the earth once in
		27（1/2）days and both Moon and earth go round the Sun once a year.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mercury and Venus are very near Sun. Sun is 93 million miles away from the earth. Mercury is 36
		millions miles away from Sun: Venus is 67 million miles away from the Sun. Therefore, there will be occasions
		when Moon, Mercury and Venus can come between the earth and the Sun.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Suppose you keep one of your fingers near either of your eyes. Close the other eye. One elephant
		standing 100 yards, away is hidden by this small finger. This depends on the size of the finger, its nearness to
		the eye and the farther distance of the elephant. Now, your eye, the finger and the elephant are in the same
		line and plane. Suppose, the elephant is lifted by a lift, in the same place. Even though the elephant was
		hidden by the finger previously, as it is lifted up above the area covered by the finger, then the elephant
		becomes visible, slowly and steadily.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus Moon is a decently big body. It is very near to the earth. The Sun is very far off. It is
		very big like the elephant compared with finger. So, when the Moon comes in between the observer and the Sun,
		the Sun is not visible. Slowly the shadow of the Moon, covers the Sun. This is called the Solar eclipse. During
		the duration of the eclipse the declination of the Moon and Sun will be the same. But if the declination is
		different, but the celestial longitude of both is the same then it is only New Moon. Similarly, when earth comes
		hetween Moon and Sun, earth prevents Moon from getting the light of the Sun, and lunar eclipse is formed.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Just like, during Solar eclipse, Sun loses its brilliance and is hidden by Moon, and during lunar
		eclipse Moon loses its pleasant light and is hidden by the earth, so also the rays of other planets are
		interrupted. Because, we, on the earth, do not receive very bright light, illuminating the objects on the earth,
		from other planets, we cannot see, notice and realise the eclipse of the other planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The planets Mercury and Venus are called Inferior planets as they are nearer to Sun than the
		earth and they can be between the Sun and the Earth, just like Moon during New Moon days and Solar eclipse days.
		Moon is hidden from Sun by the earth during lunar eclipse. But earth can never come in between Mercury and Sun
		or in between Venus and Sun. Because, Sun is the Centre. From Sun, Mercury is 36 million miles away. Venus is 67
		million miles from Sun. The distance between Sun and Earth is 92 million miles.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The other planets are called the superior planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Westerners give importance only to the Solar and Lunar eclipse. They do not attach much
		importance to the conjunction of Sun with other planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hindus pay much attention to the eclipse of the planets while they predict results of those
		planets in their dasas and bhukties, while giving transit results how a planet getting eclipsed will behave and
		also while selecting an auspicious time to celebrate marriage, or entry into a new house or for learning vedas,
		etc.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hindus are of opinion that the eclipsed planet, whether a benefic or a malefic. loses its
		strength especially to do good to the native.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In Jataka Thatvam, Mahadeva says that the planet that is eclipsed will cause trouble and produce
		untoward results. In Sanketanidhi, Ramadayalu has said that if Mars and Venus are eclipsed and occupy the 5th
		house, the person concerned becomes one-eyed and if the lord of the rising dwadasamsa is eclipsed, the person's
		property is insecure, he also says that the lord of the rising Trimsamsa when eclipsed causes misunderstanding
		among the relatives.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Kalidas is of the opinion that if the lord of a Bhava is eclipsed by the Sun's rays, the Bhava is
		completely destroyed even if the Bhava is occupied by benefics. In his work Uttara Kalamirtham, he adds that
		Venus and Saturn do not lose strength even when eclipsed.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Prithuyasas, son of Varahamihira, deals a little elaborately in his work Horasara, with the
		results of the eclipsed planets. Even though the planets may be strong by occupying a position in the Zodiac,
		yet they become weak if they are eclipsed by the Sun and hence they do not produce the good effects which are
		declared to fructify in their dasa periods, yogas and their bhavas. However strong a planet may be, still it
		will not produce any good effect if it is eclipsed, and during its dasa, results will be bad. It will apply to
		the results of the Bhava it owns and also occupies. He also mentions that planets, excepting Venus and Saturn,
		lose half of their strength when eclipsed. If the Moon becomes eclipsed, the native will have a fall from his
		position, will be mentally afflicted, and will suffer from jaundice and similar diseases. Further, there will be
		risk from water.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mars, when eclipsed, will give trouble and many kinds of worries, and the native's mind will be
		in a destructive mood.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mercury when eclipsed, brings loss through lands and perpetual mental affliction. He will suffer
		from jaundice, sickness, catarrh, etc. He will also incur loss.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Eclipsed Jupiter gives misery and happiness in equal proportion.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Saturn in eclipsed state shows that the person's income and expenditure will balance each other.
		He will not feel happy. He will have a frail body. But his fame will spread very wide. He will be tormented by
		various mental cares.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Prithuyasas also mentions that one's education will be spoiled in the period of a planet
		occupying the navamsa sign owned by the eclipsed one.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When longevity is calculated, the Hindu sages declare that one born during the period of eclipse
		is very short-lived. If the lords of the lagna, navamsa lagna and Moon rasi are all eclipsed, the person cannot
		live long.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">While the strength of the eclipsed planet is discussed, Varahamihira says in Brihat Jataka that
		planets, when eclipsed, contribute only one half of what longevity they can give in the same position in the
		Zodiac, if they are not eclipsed. But Mantreswara in Phaladeepika writes that the strength of an eclipsed planet
		is nil and a person will meet with his end in its dasa within a short time after it starts. Destruction to the
		members of the family and wealth is threatened. He will have litigation and may suffer humiliation. He says that
		the eclipsed</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">planet ruling the 7th house shows loss of wife; lord of 5 denotes danger to children and lord of
		lagna will cause death to the native. If the planet is not eclipsed, good effect of the bhava will be enjoyed.
		All will welcome the lord of 6 to be eclipsed as it is strong to destroy the enemies.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334415" class="block_12">Correct interpretation K. P:</h3>
	<p class="block_4">[What eclipsed planet can do in its period or sub-period.]</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Let us consider the results of the planets situated in the constellation of those which are
		eclipsed and what they signify. If a planet is deposited in the constellation of an eclipsed one and if it is
		the sub-lord of the lagna cusp, the sub-lord shows that the native will be imprisoned; he will lead the life in
		cognito; will suffer from fear, disease and anxiety, will participate in funeral rites; incur loss and may lose
		position too, will be unfortunate, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 2nd cusp: Behaves stupidly in a public assembly, will be untrustworthy, will receive
		annoying letters, write bad ones or anonymous ones suffer from eye troubles, will be foul-tongued, spend
		heavily, incur royal displeasure.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 3rd cusp: Demise of brother, evil advice, trouble through secret mechanisation of
		internal enemies, humiliation, discomfixture and loss of pride thereby.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 4th cusp: Distress to mother, sickness to dear friends, danger to building, trouble
		due to the loss of cattle, danger from water and conveyance.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 5th cusp: Loss of a child, aberration of the mind, deception, wearisome, wandering,
		trouble in the stomach, displeasure of the Government and bodily weakness.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 6th cusp: Will have troubles through thieves, will suffer reverse, defeat, will
		commit wicked acts, will do servile duties, will be despised, scandalised and injured.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 7th cusp: Distress to son-in-law, separation from beloved, untoward results due to
		the troubles from the opposite sex, intrigues with wicked women, diseases in the private parts, ever wandering.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 8th cusp: Excessive sorrow: want of sense, carnal appetite, jealousy,
		unconsciousness, poverty, fruitless rambling, sickness, humiliation and death.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 9th cusp: Will incur the wrath of the deity or Guru or preceptor or father suffer
		something untoward, trouble to wife and children, will do wicked acts, elder's demise, will suffer from poverty.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 10th cusp: Fruitless attempts, loss of honour, will become wicked, leave his
		permanent place, inauspicious happenings, will lead bad life, suffer troubles.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 11th cusp: Bad news, trouble to elder brother, sickness to children, will suffer
		misery, deception and ear disease. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sub lord of 12th cusp: Various diseases, dishonour, disappearance of wealth, detention, bondage.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">These results will be experienced by a person when he runs the dasa, bhukti or anthra of the sub
		lord as mentioned above.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mantreswara gives hopes by saying that a planet, even when eclipsed, if it occupies an auspicious
		sign and Navamsa, will, in its period, offer mixed results and finally in the latter half at its dasa, agreeable
		and beneficial results.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Transit results of eclipsed planets: Planets in their transit through favourable houses (houses,
		constellations and subs wherein they have to give good effects) become void of effect if they happen to be
		eclipsed. But if the houses transitted by them be unfavourable, then they will give bad effects in an aggravated
		form.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Election of auspicious time for any undertaking: Avoid the constellation in which the recent
		eclipses have appeared within six months before and after the month when one desires to do any auspicious work,
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">It is also declared that it is not advisable to celebrate Upanayanam or marriage or construct a
		building or enter into new premises when Jupiter and Venus are eclipsed. It is called Guru, Sukra Moodam or
		Moudyam or Asthamanam".</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">People belonging to Sama Veda should not initiate mantra and do Upanayana when Mars is eclipsed.
		Rig Veda people should avoid these when Jupiter is eclipsed. If Venus is eclipsed, Yajur Veda people should not
		have Upanayanam.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Westerners are of opinion that the conjunction of Sun and Moon is highly conducive to promote
		material welfare and to have bright careers from the time of conjunction. Sun and Mars in close conjunction give
		force of character and power of endurance. Great self-control is to be exercised. There will be struggle between
		one's will and desires during one's life.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun and Mercury in close conjunction give much mental ability, with a clear thinking of high
		order. It gives adaptability. One will have reasoning ability, memory and fluency of speech. The greasest
		orators, chief engineers, famous accountants and auditors are having Sun and Mercury in the same longitude
		(degree and minute) when it is combust. Only a few are perverted and dogmatic depending on the sub-lord (K. P.
		explains it).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun in conjunction with Jupiter makes one a scholar. He will maintain good health, enjoy mental
		equilibrium and have professional advancement. New undertakings will prosper and constructive ability will be
		strengthened.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Conjunction of Sun and Venus shows popularity and social success. He will acquire competence in
		music, art, poetry, wrestling etc. He will gain through the other sex. Marriage will give continuous happiness.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Conjunction of Saturn and Sun gives indomitable will, courage and strength of intellect. It does
		not promote material. happiness. IIl-health and obstacles delay one's advancement in life. But it brings lot of
		power, authority and responsibility if Saturn receives good aspects from benefits. (One may become sanyasi.)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus Westerners have taken each planet, observed the results and have recorded them. Those who
		are interested to do research can take the horoscope of those in whom a few planets are eclipsed and observe the
		various results enjoyed by them during the dasa of the eclipsed planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Stellar Astrological Research Institute, Madras, verified various charts and found out that the
		eclipsed planets give both good and bad results in their dasas, depending upon the Bhuktinathas, i.c., a person
		born in Dhanur lagna having Mercury eclipsed, had his marriage and prosperity in his profession during Mercury
		Dasa. As lord of 7, it gave marriage, and as lord of 10 gave promotion. A person born in Vrischika Lagna with
		Moon in Vrischika had Venus eclipsed at the time of his birth. He had his wedding in Venus Dasa and he enjoyed
		his married life. He also invested money on luxurious articles, jewels and furniture. Thus one can see that the
		planet when eclipsed does not become a malefic and deny the results which it has to offer.</p>
