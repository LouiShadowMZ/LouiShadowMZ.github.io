</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Raid is generally result of some secret
inimical activity resulting into loss of reputation and also money. Nowa-days,
a few persons have amassed wealth by not submitting correct accounts and saved
money either in this country or abroad. But, when their time is bad, the
servants or the neighbours or some unreliable friends who gather information,
during unguarded moments, betray, give information, leak out the truth and land
the native in trouble.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 12th houses indicates sudden and
surprising loss, confiscation by Government etc., by one's own wrongful acting,
secret enemies, secret inimical activity, cheating etc. etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Who will betray and give information to the
police is to be judged from the sub-lord of the 12th cusp. If the sub-lord of
12th cusp is connected with houses 3 (younger brother or neighbour) and 6 (open
enemy) then one's own younger brother or neighbour will openly betray. If it is
connected to houses 3 and 12 (secret enmity) one's own younger brother or
neighbour will secretly give the information to the police. Houses 6 and 12
indicate that servants will do harm. 11 and 12 show that the so-called friend
or elder brother betrays the native. 9 and 12 indicate that either father or a
stranger will be harmful. 4 and 12 show that the informant is in his own house,
street or town. 7 and 12 threaten that either the partner in business, as soon
as he severs connection, shows his true colour; or the native's wife, after
divorce etc. will call on the police and give information.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 12th house shows loss of money, and
also loss of reputation as it is 12th to 1st house (showing reputation of the
native).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To ascertain loss of reputation and that of
money, consider the 12th house and find out the significators. The
significators are to found out in the following manner:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) The planets situated in the
constellation of the occupants of the 12th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ii) The planets tenanted in the 12th
bhava.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(iii) Planets in the constellation of lord
of 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(iv) Lord of 12 (lord of the sign in which
the 12th cusp falls).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(v) Nodes firstly give the results of the
planet or planets with which they are conjoined, then of the planet in whose
constellation they are deposited, then the planets aspecting them and lastly
the planet in whose sign it is deposited.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All the above significators are connected
with the 12th house matters and all of them can give 12th house results but in
varying degree.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore what one is to do is to find out
the significators of 12th house, verify which of these significators are common
with the ruling planets at the moment of judgment, find out the period that is
running and that which is to follow and pass the judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 12th house will be in everybody's
chart. Significators of 12th house will also come in everybody's chart- Does it
mean that everybody's house will be raided some day or the other? No! Then how
to judge? Find out the sub-lord of the 12th cusp and see whether it is a strong
significator of 12th house. If it is, then the danger of loss of reputation and
also money is indicated. Otherwise not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out the sub lord and analyse, a
number 90 within 249 is given. The horary chart showing the disposition of the
twelve cusps and the planetary position at the moment of judg ment is given
above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 12th cusp is 7 50 Karka, i.e. Moon sign
Saturn star and Kethu sub. Kethu is deposited in the constellation of Sun who
is in 12th bhava. Therefore the sub-lord of 12th cusp is a strong significator
of 12th house. Therefore danger of loss of reputation and also money is
indicated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kethu, the sub-lord of the 12th cusp, is
deposited in lagna in the sign Leo owned by Sun and also Kethu is conjoined
with Mercury. Therefore Kethu represents both Sun and Mercury. Sun is owner of
Ist (native) and occupant of 12th (secret inimical activity), Mercury is
occupant of 1st bhava and owner of 2nd (one's own family) and 11th (friend or
elder brother). Therefore because of the consultant's own wrongful actions
(houses 1 and 12) either his elder brother (11th house) or a family friend
(houses 2 and 11) will secretly (12th house) give information to the police
who, in turn, will raid the native's house during the conjoined period of the
planets common in significators and the ruling planets at the moment of
judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 12th bhava is occupied by Sun and Moon.
It is owned by Moon Kethu in Simha represents Sun. No planet is in any of the
three stars, Aswini, Magha and Mula owned by Kethu. Jupiter is posited in the
Hastha star owned by Moon and Kethu is deposited in Uttarapalguni star owned by
Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the significators of the 12th
house are Sun, Kethu, Jupiter and Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us find out the ruling planets. They
are the lords of the day, rasi, star, lagna and lagna star at the moment of
judg ment. The lord of the day is Mars, that of rasi is Moon, of star is
Mercury (who is represented by Kethu as it conjoins with Kethu) and the lagna
falls in Uttarashada star owned by Sun in the sign Makata governed by Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the ruling planets are Mars,
Moon, Kethu, Mercury, Saturn and Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The common in the ruting planets and the
significators are Sun, Kethu and Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now let us see what dasa-bhukti he is
running. Balance of Mercury Dasa is 14 years 11 months and 8 days. As Mercury
is no way connected with raid, you need not fear till Mercury Dasa ends. It
ends on 20-7-1984. (A doubt may come is somebody's mind that whether the native
will be alive till this date, Let us see. Judge the 8th house which shows one's
longevity. No planet is in 8th. It is owned by Jupiter. Also, Jupiter aspects
8th house. Therefore it gives long life to the native who is at present 30 years
old) After Mercury, Kethu Dasa starts. Kethu is a strong significator of 12th.
It is a ruling planet at the moment of judgment and also the sub-lord of the
12th cusp. Therefore Kethu Dasa Kethu Bhukti will be dangerous. It runs from
20-7-1984 to 17-12-1984. In this Sun Antra operates between 23-8-1984 and
30-8-1984 and Moon Antra operates from 30-8-1984 to 13-9-1984. Therefore
somewhere from 23-8-1984 to 13-9-1984 loss of reputation and also money due to
raid in the house is sure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For exact date consider the transit of Sun.
Sun transits Sun star Moon sub in the sign Leo owned by Sun on 10-9-1984
Therefore, on this date there will be raid in your house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="16.4_Will I Be Prosecuted By Income Tax Department.html">← Will I Be Prosecuted By Income Tax Department</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_16.5_Will there be any raid in my house">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="16.6_Which Gem will suit me.html">Which Gem will suit me →</a></div></body>
