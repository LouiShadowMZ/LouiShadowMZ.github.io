that number fix the ascendant referring to the Table for Krishnamurti
Padhdhati.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the ascendant is in a movable sign, the
11th house is the badhakasthana, if the ascendant falls in a fixed sign, 9th
house is the badhakasthann, if the ascendant falls in a common sign, the 7th
house is the badhakasthana.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whatever be the sign in which the ascendant
falls, the 2nd and the 7th houses are marakasthanas. Therefore one is to judge
all these three houses and find out the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One has to erect the map and note down the
dasa balance to find out the date of death.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to western system, the ascendant,
the Moon and the Sun should not be forming evil aspects with the lord of 4, 6,
8 and 12, and at the same time the lord of the ascendant the Moon and the Sun
must be strong. In that case, long life is promised. Jupiter and Venus ruling
good houses and the lord of the ascendant forming good aspect with Moon or Sun
promises long life. But if the ascendant, Moon and Sun are receiving bad
aspects like square, opposition, conjunction etc., from the lord of 4, 6, 8 or
12, only short life is indicated. This is how the westerners proceed, they say
that the ascendant, its lord and the Moon indicate the consultant's health and
longevity. They add that lord of the ascendant retrograde or deposited in 8, or
lord of 8 in one, or malefics occupying one and 8 will cause short life. To
note for how many more years one would live, they calculate as follows: If the
lord of the ascendant will form either conjunction or square or opposition with
Sun or to the lord of 8, 6 or 4, calculate how many degrees he is away from
that planet. Then calculate according to the rules given already.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Krishnamurti Padhdhati: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Note the sub-lord of the ascendant. If he is deposited in the
constellation of the significators of badhakasthana and marakasthana the life
will be short after the time of judgment. It will not be for many years. If
sub-lord of the ascendant were to be in the constellation of the significator
of sixth house, the person will suffer from disease but will not succumb to it;
but if the sub-lord of the ascendant is deposited in the constellation of the
significator of the 8th house, he will meet with accident. If the sub-lord of
the ascendant in the Horary Chart is the significator of the 12th house, he
will be in bed for long period and may be admitted in a hospital. Death is
indicated only by the significators of marakasthana and badhakasthana.
According to the strength of the lord of the constellation in which the
sub-lord of the ascendant is deposited, one is to fix the dasa and the
sub-periods. Calculate from the horoscope erected for the number (Horary) and
work out, after how many years and months, the conjoined period of the
significators will operate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Predict that he will live only for so many
years and months. Never omit to confirm by taking the ruling planets at the
moment of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div align="center">

P.M. on 24-10-67</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By 246 it is meant that Jupiter's sign
Pisces, Mercury star Revathi and the sub of Mars is the Ascendant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub-lord Mars is in the constellation
of Kethu in the 7th house. Hence the death is inevitable and by transit when
lord of 1, the ascendant conjoins the node in the 7th house, in that year, when
Sun transits in Sun's star and Kethu sub and when Moon transits the
constellation of Rahu or Guru or Kethu, the end will come.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling planets: Day lord, Mars. Ascendant

star governed by Rahu and the lord of the sign where Moon is Mercury. Hence the
ruling planets are Rahu, Mars, Mercury and Kethu. Jupiter and Mars are in Kethu
constellation. Since Mercury is in the sign and house, where Kethu is, take
Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore in the conjoined period of the
ruling planets the life must end.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Analysis:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For death, we must consider the
badhakasthana and the marakasthanas. As Pisces is lagna, it is a common sign..
7th house from this sign is badhakasthana. For common sign the 7th house is
badhakasthana and marakasthana, and Kendhrasthana. So it is trebly evil to
cause the death.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, the
following are the significators of death:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) The planets posited in the
constellation of the occupants of badhakasthana and marakasthana.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The planets occupying the above said
houses </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The planets in the constellation of the
lords of the above said badhaka and maraka houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) The lords of these houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) Those which are conjoined with the
significators or aspected by them, thereby having connection with these
matters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now let us analyse houses 2 and 7.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The second bhava is unoccupied by any
planet. Mars is lord of 2 Rahu is in Aries, representing Mars. Rahu (a node) is
therefore more strong to give the result. Select Rahu. Sun is in Rahu star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The seventh bhava is occupied by Sun, Kethu
and retrograde Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury rules Ashlesha, Jyeshta and
Revathi. No planet is in any. Mercury (R) is in the constellation of Jupiter
and in the sub of retrograde Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun is conjoined with Kethu. Kethu rules
Aswini, Makha and Moola. Rahu, Mars and Jupiter are in the constellation of
Kethu. Jupiter is in 6th sign and aspects both Mars and Rahu. Jupiter is also
in sub Rahu, a significator of death. Mars is represented by node Rahu. Kethu
is also occupant of 7th bhava. Kethu is in the constellation of Mars (lord of
2) and in the sub of Venus (lord of 8), a strong significator of death. Finally
take Rahu, Kethu and Jupiter.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If we analyse dasa system, the native is
running Rahu Dasa, Mercury Bhukti. (Balance 1 year and 26 days).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus we come to the conclusion that during
Rahu Dasa Kethu Bhukti Rahu Anthra. Jupiter Shookshma the native will meet with
his death.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I predicted that it would be in the month
of May, 1969. (Actually this person died in May 1969.)</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.1_HOW LONG WILL ONE LIVE_2"><span lang="EN-US">What about ailment</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Health is generally good if the sub-lord of
the ascendant is deposited in the constellation of the planet occupying the
house 1 or 11. But, if the sub-lord of the ascendant is deposited in the
constellation of a planet which is the significator of 1 and 6, one will suffer
from disease during its periods and sub-periods. If the sub-lord of the 6th
house is deposited in the constellation of a planet which is the significator
of the 6 and 1 and not of 11, then the sub-lord, during its sub-period, will
give the disease. If the sub-lord is deposited in a constellation, the lord of
which is connected in any manner with Saturn, the disease is a chronic one.
Even, if the sub-lord is Saturn, the disease is a chronic one. But, if the
sub-lord is in any manner connected with Mars, it is an acute disease. Mercury
shows complications.</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.1_HOW LONG WILL ONE LIVE_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cure When</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally, one falls ill at the time when
the conjoined period of the planets connected with the 6th and the first house
in any manner operates; but, the cure comes only when the significator of the
5th or 11th house follows the period governed by the disease producing 6th
house significator. One will survive from the disease after the cure, only when
his longevity is promised. (For longevity, one has to find out the Bathaka
Sthana and Maraka Sthana. These will give a clear picture).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards the nature of the disease, I
have already published what each sign, star and sub indicates and said what it
would be. Therefore, you have to refer to it and then ascertain which part of
the body will be affected.</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.1_HOW LONG WILL ONE LIVE_4"><span lang="EN-US">Accident</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Astrology, there is nothing as Accident.
Astrological dictionary does not have this word because, for every result,
there is a cause. Therefore, even that which the people call as Accident is
something which happens when least expected. Anything that is a surprise and an
unexpected one alone is classified as an accident, whether the result is
favourable or unfavourable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, the sub-lord of the 8th house is
to be deposited in the constellation of the planet which is the significator of
the 8th house. If the significator happens to be also the significator of the
6th house, then he will have fever, etc., following the accident. If the same
sub-lord is in the star of a planet who is also the significator of the 12th,
he will be admitted in a hospital. If the sub-lord happens to be the
significator of Bathaka Sthana, and Makara Sthana; he will succumb to it,
provided his longevity is not further more promised. If the longevity is
promised, he will get over this, and the condition of the patient would be
threatening. Some may be unconscious; some may be given blood transfusion and
also oxygen. Therefore we have to judge both the longevity and also the
duration of the disease.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.3_ECLIPSE ECLIPSED PLANET-RESULTS.html">← ECLIPSE ECLIPSED PLANET-RESULTS</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_06.1_HOW LONG WILL ONE LIVE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="06.2_ABSENT PERSON ALIVE OR DEAD.html">ABSENT PERSON ALIVE OR DEAD →</a></div></body>
