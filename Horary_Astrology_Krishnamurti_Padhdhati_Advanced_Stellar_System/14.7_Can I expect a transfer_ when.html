the houses 3, 10 and 12 because the 3rd house shows change of place and short
journey, 10th shows employment and the 12th shows altogether new circumstances,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To proceed on leave or to go on tour, the
houses3, 9 and 12 are to be considered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to K. P. the owner of a house is
the owner of the sign where the cusp falls. Planets in the constellation of the
owner of a House are stronger than the owner to give the results of that house.
Further the occupant of a bhava is stronger than the planets in the
constellations of the owner of the house and the planets in the constellations
of the occupants are stronger than the occupants. All these planets will, how
ever, give the results of that house, but in a varying degree as above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu and Kethu are nodes. They are always
stronger than the planets represented by them. They give firstly the results of
the planet or planets with which they are conjoined, then the results of the
planet in whose constellation they are deposited, then that of the planets
aspecting them and then the results of the owner of the sign occupied by them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The query is whether he can expect transfer
and, if yes, when? This depends upon what dasa and bhukti he is running. One
can expect transfer during the conjoined period of the signi- ficators of
houses 3, 10 and 12. The significators of the houses 3, 10 and 12 are Moon,
Mercury, Kethu, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Mars. Whenever the significators are
more in number the best method to select the beneficial ones and eliminate the
tempters is to find out the ruling planets at the time of judgment. and see
which of them are common with the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Those ruling planets which are deposited in
the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet will not read the result.
Reject them and take the remaining.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To-day is Wednesday ruled by Mercury. The
owners of the sign and star transited by Moon are Mars and Kethu respectively.
The lagna is Thulam governed by Venus. As Rahu is associated with Venus take
Rahu also. (Kethu is aspected by Venus and is posited in Mercury's sign. But it
has already come as a ruling planet).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the ruling planets are Mercury, Mars,
Kethu, Venus and Rahu. None of them are posited either in the constellation or
sub of a retrograde planet. All of them are common with the significators. So
you can expect transfer during their conjoined period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars is by itself retrograde. So it will
not be able to give the results as long as it is retrograde. Afterwards it can
give.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to dasa-bhukti at the time of
judgment, Kethu dasa balance was 2 years 3 months 2 days from 14-5-1969. The
bhukti running is that of Jupiter, Jupiter is not a ruling planet. Then comes
Saturn bhukti but Saturn is also not a Tuling planet. Then follows Mercury
Bhukti. Mercury is a ruling planet. So you can expect transfer either in Venus
Antra or Mars Antra or Rahu Antra in Mercury Bhakti, depending upon which of
these three antra lords is strong to give you transfer. Of the four ruling
planets the lord of lagna is the strongest, if no node is representing it. In
case a node represents, then the node is the strongest. Therefore Rahu
representing Venus, the lord of lagna in the ruling planets, in the strongest
and you will be transferred in Rahu Antra. This runs between 8-3-1971 and
1-5-1971.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Transit of Sun during the above period will
give the exact date of transfer. Sun transit Kethu star Rahu sub in the sign
Aries on 24-4-1971. Therefore you will be transferred on this date and till
that date you need not expect any transfer.</span></p><span lang="EN-US"><br clear="all"/>
