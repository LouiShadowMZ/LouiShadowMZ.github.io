249,"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"One. I want to become number one. So,
I give this number. Also tell me please, what I should do," asks a boy
aged 15 in whose horoscope, he says that many planets are exalted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"You should study law, if you want to
be a lawyer: Chemistry, if you desire to be a chemist medicine, if you have to
become a doctor; but for politics, as Max O'Rell says "you need only to
study your own interest. Also you should know what Wendell Philips had said,
"Two kinds of men generally best succeed in political life; men of no
principle, but of great talent; and men of no talent, but of one principle that
of obedience to their superiors. Do you want to serve for the prosperity of your
country or what?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Charity begins at home, is what all
say: But I want to do good so that my children and grandchildren will lead a
pleasant and peaceful life. There should be discipline, security for life,
security of property, etc. I do not want to be a minister but I want to serve
and satisfy the mass."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Then say that you want to become a
statesman." </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"What is the difference between a
politician and a statesman?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"A politician acts in such a way
always bearing in his or her mind the next election. But a statesman cares more
for the welfare of the next generation. A politician will form a party and join
such a party which come out successful whereas a stateman minds only the
progress and prosperity of his country: so, a statesman will guide and direct
his course of action, whereas a politician will yield, adjust to circumstances
and be satisfied to drift."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Thanks, Sir: I want to be a
statesman. Can I become a famous statesman."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"So, just like a coachman follows his
horses but he holds. on the reign and at appropriate time guides them, you
should conduct yourself. You should remember what Coleridge has advised. The
three great ends for a statesman are, security to possessors, facility to
acquirers and liberty and hope to the people,"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"You can become a famous statesman, by
doing nothing yourself but causing everything to be done. Leave nothing to
chance: be attentive night and day: see into failure: do not regard the
present: then only you can change a nation from what it is to what it ought to
be."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes! What does my number one
indicate?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First It shows that you need advice for
success. So I did.. Now I shall predict."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whenever Saturn is in lagna one should have
patience and perseverance. Don't you know that people who want to do good,
never get discouraged if they are defeated once, twice and so on. What is
perseverance? Does it not clearly show that a few attempts fail and again an
attempt is made.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Nothing is impossible. Can I go round the
world. I have no conveyance, etc. Johnson said. He that shall work, with
vigour, three hours a day, will pass in seven years, a space equal to the
circumstances of the globe. So you be making attempts. When once you start this
noble enterprise, do not leave it: go ahead.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The horoscope is as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">

politician or a statesman. There is no planet in the 5th Bhava. But the owner
of the sign Cancer where the 5th cusp is Moon: sub-lord and the lord of the

constellation of lord of 5 in 11. Therefore Mercury promises grand success and
success after success as it is Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"When, Sir?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As Moon is in 17 19 in Aquarius Rahu Dasa

you have to judge the following Dasas. Saturn, in direct. motion as lord of 11
in the constellation of Kethu in 6 shows success and realisation of ambition.
But, note in which sub it is: who the sub lord is: it is Jupiter who is
retrograde. Therefore in the period of Saturn, Saturn will tempt but cannot
fulfil your desire.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But Mercury is in the constellation of
