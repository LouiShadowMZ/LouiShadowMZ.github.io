23 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether one is promised children or not is
to he judged from the 5th cusp. One will be able to produce children if the
following three conditions are simultaneously satisfied:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) The sub-lord of the 5th cusp is not
retrograde.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ii) It is not posited in a constellation
of a retrograde planet and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ii) It is a significator of either 2nd or
5th or 11th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If any one of these three conditions is not
satisfied, one will not be able to produce a child at all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To judge the time of birth of child, one
has to select the significators of houses 2, 5 and 11 and predict the time
during the conjoined period of the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 5th cusp is very important to see
whether one is capable of producing a child or not. The 11th house is the 5th
house of the partner. Therefore the 11th cusp shows whether the partner will be
able to produce children or not. If the 5th cusp shows that he can and he will
have children and the 11th shows that the partner cannot naturally, he will
have children somewhere else. If the 11th cusp shows that the partner can
produce and 5th cusp denotes that he cannot produce, then the wife will have
natural children. If both the 5th cusp and the 11th cusp promise progeny then
they will both have children. But the children born may or may not be due to
the husband and the husband also can have children outside, other than what he
can have through his wife. If both the 5th and 11th cusps are not favourable,
they will both be sterile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The number, within 249, given by the

sterile, both are productive, judge the 5th cusp for husband and 11th cusp for
wife (because the number is given by the husband).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 5th cusp is 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
36' Aries, i. e. Mars sign, Venus star and Jupiter sub. Jupiter is neither
retrograde or deposited in the constellation of a retrograde planet. But it is
not a significator of any of the houses 2 or 5 or 11 (see table of
significators). Therefore of the three essential conditions for the ability to
produce children, the third condition is not satisfied. This clearly means that
the husband is sterile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now take the 11th cusp. It is Tulam 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 36</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> i.e. in Venus sign Jupiter star and
Jupiter sub. Jupiter is neither retrograde nor deposited in a constellation
whose lord is retrograde. Also Jupiter is a strong significator of 8th house
which is the 2nd house counted from the lagna of the wife. Therefore the third
condition is satisfied here and the wife will be able to produce children.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When she is productive and her husband is
sterile, she will have natural children.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The houses 2, 5 and 11 counted from the
lagna of wife are 5, 8 and 11. From the table of significators, the
significators of theses houses are Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, Kethu and
Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which of these significators will really
give children and which are merely temptors is to be found out from the ruling
planets. They are the lords of the day, rasi, star, lagna and lagna-star at the
moment of judgment. The day is Sunday ruled by Sun. The sign and star transited
by Moon are owned by Jupiter and Mercury respectively. The lagna is 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Dhanus, i.e. Jupiter sign Venus star. As Kethu occupies Sun's sign,
take Kethu also. Therefore the ruling planets are Sun, Jupiter, Mercury Venus
and Kethu. They are also the significators.. Therefore they will give her child
during their conjoined period. and sub period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to dasa-bhukti at the time of
judgment, Mercury Dasa balance was 1 year 1 month and 23 days from 3-8-1969.
The bhukti running is that of Saturn. Saturn is not a ruling planet. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So Saturn Bhukti will not give. Kethu Dasa
will start 26-9-1970. On 23-2-1971 Venus Bhukti will commence, On 26-9-1971
Jupiter Anthra will start. This will run upto 22-11-1971. This period will give
her a child, if transit agrees.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun transits Jupiter star Kethu sub in
Venus sign Tulam on 22-10-1971. Therefore transit also agrees and she will have
a child on this date. (Let us wait and see how the prediction comes true.)</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="10.4_Can I Prosper as an Actress or an Actor.html">← Can I Prosper as an Actress or an Actor</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_10.5_Any Child for me_ Who is Sterile">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="10.6_Child-Birth_ Number within 108.html">Child-Birth_ Number within 108 →</a></div></body>
