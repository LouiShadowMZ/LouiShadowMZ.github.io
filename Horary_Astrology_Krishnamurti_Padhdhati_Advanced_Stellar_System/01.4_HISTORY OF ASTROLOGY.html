<body><h2 id="heading_01.4_HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY_0"><span lang="EN-US">HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The history of Astrology begins with
Creation itself. Sage Garga says that the science was propounded by the Creator
Himself and that Brahma handed it down to him at the time of creation. From
Garga, other sages learnt it and it was spread all over. It appears to be
co-eval with that of the earth.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In western countries there is a certain
belief that Seth (3,769 B.C.) was the world</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s first
astrologer. This can be inferred from the astrological books written later by
Arabic, Egyptian, Jewish, and Persian writers. Westerners believe that Seth was
the first person to study the planets, their motions and their pathway. It is
he who divided the Zodiac into twelve equal parts, as he found that the Sun
ever follows a particular path in the Heavens, year after year; and he also
noticed that this circular route of the Sun was spaced out by twelve full
moons. Full Moon occurs once a month. Therefore, the Sun's path is divided into
12 equal parts called </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Mazzaroth</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> which term we designate as </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Signs</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> or solar mansions.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Around 2,600 years ago, the priests and the
shepherds of Chaldea took this science for serious study and developed it.
Their period was called the Golden Ages of Astrology, because they connected
the movements of the planets with all kinds of events in human life.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dr. Thompson says that the Akkadians and
the Sumerians observed the heavens and heavenly bodies and tried to note their
courses. The Babylonians and the Egyptians attributed some influence over the
animate and the inanimate objects on the earth. Astrology was popular and it
wielded great influence over the rich, the priests, the princes and the kings.
Maspero said, that, in his time, the Mistress of the world was Astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some are of the opinion that Astrology had
its origin in Chaldea from time immemorial. They suggest that the very name
Chaldean means </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Astrologer</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.
The Pythagoreans further advanced the concepts of the Chaldeans. They applied
higher mathematics. Later, astrology came into the hands of the Greeks. They
concentrated more on Natal Astrology, as they had a deep-rooted religious
nature and an enquiring mind. They always posed the questions: "Who am I?
Why am I born? What for do I live? Why are there so much of inequalities in
life?" They had the answers only through astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many of the records of the early
astrologers of Nineveh and Babylon are found among the early tablets in the
British Museum, some of their findings are dated nearly 5,000 years ago.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Greeks were also enthusiastic in
following astrology. They erected the horoscope for the time of birth and
presaged the finance, family, fate, fortune and future of the individuals. One
of the Greek horoscopes written in Papyrus about 2,000 years ago is kept in the
British Museum. The Chaldeans who practiced this art of Astrology were held in
high esteem even at the time of Alexander the Great.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Egyptians were equally interested in
Astrology, which played an important role. They were also responsible for
shaping the future of the nation. As can be seen from the monuments, the
inscriptions, and modern investigations, this science dates back to 5,000 B.C.
Pharaohs gave much respect to the astrologers of whom Babilus was the leader.
He was always consulted and the duty of Babilus was to find out the charts of
those who might per chance gain power, become a rival and create trouble to the
emperor. Whenever Babilus foresaw any such native, he informed the king, who
put such people to death. Pharaohs had faith in their astrologers. Often they
were consuIted to interpret the dreams of the king. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Persia, the kings honoured the
astrologers for their sound knowledge of this science. It is only Gjamasp
otherwise known as "Al Hakim" (meaning Learned), an astrologer in
Persian court who precisely predicted the time of birth of the prophets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Saracens spread the Science in Spain in
711 A.D. and the North Africans, the Moors, in 1,237 carried the science to
Europe</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dr. Brewster admits that in China about
2,752 B.C. from the days of King Fohi, they developed astronomy nobly for
studying astrology and emperors were chosen according to the profound knowledge
possessed by them in astrology. In 2,513 B.C. Cheuni was elected as the King in
that manner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whenever Alexander the Great went out, he
took with him the astronomer Calisthenis in all his campaigns. He spread the
science in the east by giving out some of the rational methods adopted there
and his visit to India had helped him to learn more and develop it further in
his country.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Henry Cornelius Agrippa, born in 1486, was
the astrologer to Francis I of France when he was 38 years old, John Dee was
the favourite astrologer of Queen Elizabeth. Albu Mezar of Bulah was the
professor of Mundane Astrology at Bagdad. The Caliph Mammonarrasheed translated
many ancient astrological works into Arabic</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, every nation is to be credited with
the knowledge of this Science. It is advisable to learn the experiences and
findings of research workers who had contributed to the technique of correct
prediction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let me mention the names of a few
foreigners who have contributed to the development of this Science. They were
not only scholars in Astrology but were renowned and reputed Astronomers,
Historians, Philosophers, Physicians and Poets. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astronomers: Ptolemy (67 A.D.) Galileo
Newton Pythagoras Kepler (27-12-1571) Copernicus, </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrologers: Alan Leo (-11-1862) Sepharial
Dr. W. J. Llewellyn Hayden George Agrippa (Simmonite Max Heindel Carter Parker
Morirus Maurice Sibley Wemyss W. Lily Culpeter Boreham Robson Newton.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Historians: Diodorus Coley Pabwal Maximus
Josephus Plutarch Camden Heroditus</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Philosophers: Lilly Macrobius Aristote
Bacon Thales Pliny Anasagoros Pliny Ptolemy</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Physicians: Hypocrates Foster John Dee
Gilbert Partridge Agrippa Starkey</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Poets: Hypocrates Foster Galen John Dee
Gilbert Partridge Agrippa. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In India, it is said that it was the sage
Garga who handed down the Science to his disciples. Further there are recorded
evidences that Yavanas were very learned astrologers and that they lived many
centuries before Varahamihira, who admired, in his text-books, the progress
made by the Yavanas in this Science. Yavanas have contributed much for the
development of this Science in India. There are records to show that around
3,102 B.C. the Trivalore Tables were used solely for astrological purposes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following list furnishes the names of a
few renowned Indian Scholars who expounded, explained and interpreted this
Science: Garga: Viddha Garga: Asita; Aryabhatta; Bhrigu; Brihaspathi Badarayana
Baradwaja: Bhadalla Devaswami;Devala Dravyavardhana; Garutman Jeevasamon:
Kapila; Kanabuk: Kashyappa: Latacharya; Manu; Manitha; Maya; Parasara; Panlisa
Pitamaha-Romaka; Rishiputa; Sidhasena; Simhacharya Saka; Sapatharishi:
Saraswatha; Savitra: Satyacharya; Sidhasena; Yavanachara; Varahamihira:
Bathothpala: Prithyuyasas; Vaidyanatha Dikshithar; and many others.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus it can be seen that astrology was held
in great esteem in all ages by the leaders in other sciences also.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As years passed by, for various reasons
this science, which is to live long, and which will surely live long, has lost
some of its charms. But science remains ever a science. In every age, a
particular science alone receives much attention and is developed, even though
every science has its own innate value and is useful to us. No country had ever
passed quiet without any advancement in any branch of science. So in every age
any one science may be very popular, whereas the other sciences may be ignored,
though not totally forgotten. It is not unlikely that there are people even now
those names would come as a great surprise to all; there will be very earnest
and loyal student of astrology who will popularise astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This book is published with the sincere
desire that Astrology should be made popular. Much of Research is done
regularly and systematically. Furthermore it has to be carried out. There
should be fool-proof methods to read accurate results. Students of astrology
with half-baked knowledge should be educated and imparted higher knowledge.
Their doubts should be cleared. Those who bring ridicule to this noble science
should be silenced by producing able astrologers who will give correct
knowledge to them. It is only with correct and clear understanding of the
subject one can predict astoundingly accurate results, and establish that the
noble legacy, astrology, given to us by our forefathers, is indeed a science
which is as accurate as any other science. The present position of astrology,
in the hands of a number of astrologers, is really deplorable, The excuse may
be that there is no proper education to them and hence the result is
unsatisfactory. Even when watches are manufactured by the same concern, no two
watches agree. If they are manufactured by many, one can guess, how they will
be. Similarly, astrologers and a few other professionals usually offer
different opinions, confusing the already depressed consultant. So I suggest
that coaching up of students is absolutely necessary to have the same school of
thought. To say that it is not a fit subject cannot be said as a wise statement
from the astrologers point of view.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In many other countries, astrology is
included in the curriculum. It is understood that, in American University,
Astrology is included. Also, there are schools of Astrology in Germany,
Switzerland, Holland and France. Now in India in Jaipur astrology is included.
KULAPATIJI Dr. MUNSHI is conducting course on Astrology in Delhi and Madras
where I coach up students and in Bombay where learned scholars with vast
experience teach. Scientific circles there, give serious attention to it.
Astrologers are to-day thankful to the Astrological Research Association of New
York which publish quarterly (Editor Charles Jayne), and all Research Scholars
are allowed to contribute their articles. At present in India, Astrology is
like a T. B. patient left uncared for, especially by those who alone can cure.
It is handled by a few. Of them, some are avaricious, some others have
commercialised it by fortune-telling without the desire to maintain the
prestige and utility of astrology. Some alone sacrifice everything for this noble-
science. The rash and worthless predictions of a few astrologers have debased
astrology and these are received with sarcastic smile only to be dismissed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_Toc184334361"><span lang="EN-US">Nadis</span></a></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some people feel sorry that they consulted
"Nadis" written on palmyra leaves claimed to be written by the
ancient Rishis of India. It is a fact that the events in the lives of many
persons born and yet to be born are found written already by Hindu genius.
People who have consulted add that they are dumbfounded with the surprisingly
accurate predictions about the past events, but feel upset when the future
events fail miserably. This is a common complaint. Thousands of years ago,
Rishis wrote these wonderful predictions. When they can be very correct in all
the predictions from the time of birth of the native till the date of
consultation, why they should fail in their future predictions cannot be
explained. I also agree with those who say that this needs proper investigation
because there are large number of genuine Nadis and it is likely that a few may
be unauthentic ones. The solution can be found easily if the palm leaves are
handed over to the consultants, by the owners, who hold the leaves and read out
the results, as if from them. I am confident that if the palm leaves are given
to the qureist and if the reading of the past and present should agree
correctly. the future must also be invariably correct when alone the Nadi can
claim to be one of the genuine documents. Our sages who had written Nadis can
never fail in their predictions and they have never failed, because of their
intuitive power and scientific knowledge. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is likely that a few readers of the palm
leaves gain enough knowledge and experience in reciting verses, composed by
themselves in no time. A few of them, when they read the past events, have to
read very strictly the material as is found in the leaves, because the past has
to be correct. Then only, the consultant will hear him further. But when the
future is to be read, it is open to doubt as to whether he reads only those
materials found on the leaves or he himself coins verses suiting to the taste
of the querist. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In one case, a consultant and his friend
caught hold of such a fraud, the Nadi reader, redhanded, because he had Maha-
baratham on hand and read his life by having those leaves on hand, looking at
them and turning over pages after pages every 5 minutes. Another experience at
Benares was also published in the magazine Astrology and Athrishta. It is a
pity that the existence of a very few of such people bring ridicule to this
amazing Nadi. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Another investigation is also to be made to
find out whether the documents are genuine and original. There is the doubt
whether the authors, i.e., the sages, knew all languages including Tamil, etc.,
in South India, as they lived in the North having Sanskrit as the Mother Tongue
and Nadis are found in all languages also whether they used paper and pen as
some Nadis are found written in paper and claimed to be original. Whatever it
is, there are records now, to prove that astrology was practised by many people,
thousands of years ago who could predict even the birth time of a native in
20th century, the place of his birth, names of his parents, occupations, etc.,
and the events in his life marriage, profession, foreign journey, property,
conveyance, etc. They had such profound knowledge. Now it has deteriorated to a
very great extent, like a multimillionaire having a few hundreds in the bank.
It is more or less in a pitiable condition in India.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In fact, there is probably not one science
which is not properly understood, which so many pretend to know, and on which
so many are prepared to express an opinion as in the case of astrology. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Westerners are always research-minded. If
they had any truth in any statement and if they are convinced, they study it
further, and develop it. It may be that there are failures. Yet they consider
how it is possible to predict correctly in some cases, and why in other cases
there is failure: and to find out the truth, they make research till something
satisfactory is discovered. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="01.3_ASTROLOGY_AN OCCULT SCIENCE.html">← ASTROLOGY_AN OCCULT SCIENCE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_01.4_HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="01.5_Astrology-available data incomplete.html">Astrology-available data incomplete →</a></div></body>
