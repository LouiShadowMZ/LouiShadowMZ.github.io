Horary astrology mean?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_Toc184334365"><span lang="EN-US">Natal Astrology</span></a></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Natal astrology concerns largely with the
life of human beings. A chart is made out for the moment of birth and for the
particular place of birth (Latitude and Longitude being taken for calculation).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From such a chart, one can read all events
about the native; his character, temperament and peculiarities, longevity,
condition of health, accident, proneness, finance and fortune, marriage, birth
of children and also his prosperity or adversity. Moreover, the actual date of
any occurrence in his life can be calculated. Thus natal astrology is very
useful for one and all, whether he is born a King, a Kubera, or a beggar: for
health and longevity are precious to every individual. Fortune, prosperity, and
above all, peace of mind and happiness are desired by all. Hence natal
astrology is the most useful branch of this science and therefore, it behoves
all of us to support and encourage genuine research, by trained workers and
scholars, to bridge the incomplete phases in this, just as in every other
branch of science.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is a fact that 100% correct predictions
cannot be given with the literature available and with the knowledge that we
may gain by studying them alone. It is only by plodding, persevering and
patiently carrying out research that one will be able to fill up the gap,
supplement, improve, and make it perfect. One of the sub-branches of Natal
Astrology may be discussed for the consideration of the readers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There is a sub-branch called "Gochara
Phalan" by the Hindus. Westerners call it "Transit." Let it be
stated, with great humility, for the information of the readers, that the
method of prediction adopted by research scholars is, in a way, an improvement
over the application of the general principles of astrology handed down to us
by our ancient sages and scholars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the Western System, the astrologers take
the radical position of the Sun at the time of birth and consider the relative
positions of the Planets transiting in the Zodiac and give their predictions.
In India and in the Hindu System, the position of the Moon at the time of birth
of the native is taken as the starting and determining point to which the
transiting positions of the Planets are related, and according to their
relative positions, we read the results and say whether the time is auspicious
or not. Both the methods will be found to be incomplete and therefore the
percentage of failures is bound to be large. This cannot be of much advantage
to those who desire to know their future.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Western and the Hindu systems of
predictions based on the transits of planets fail in many cases whether
referred either to the Sun or to the Moon alone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For transitory results. Fortuna deserves
serious attention as it indicates certain results which are not shown by the
aspects formed by the transiting planets to those in the natal chart </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When it is found that the results enjoyed
by people born within a few minutes of each other show diametrically opposite
results, we should try and find out the factor which is so fast moving as to
cause opposite aspects and bring about such different effects.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In those few minutes can planets move much?
No! Then which will have a change in the position? Is it not lagna thereby the
other II cusps and Fortuna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All research scholars will surely declare
that the fast changing ascendant, the cusps of other houses and Fortuna cause
different aspects and produce different results. If therefore the cusps and
Fortuna are also included in all calculations and predictions offered, there
can be no great room for disappointment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Readers will do well at this stage to pause
and ponder over the significant truths, placed before them in the preceding
paragraphs. That Astrology, no doubt, is an accurate science can he proved by
taking the following instances.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Identical results are enjoyed by people
whose birth took place at the same minute, in the same Latitude and Longitude.
Let me place before the readers in a tangible and systematic form my reasons:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The first instance relates to two persons
born at the same time and who both got married to two career girls who were
earning. They had no children but both couples were very fond of domestic pets,
cats and dogs. The two males were lecturers producing identical results, with
equal interest in politics, philosophy and religion. Minor events in their
lives were also strikingly similar; for example, both suffered from tooth-ache
at the same time and on the same day. Yet, the two male partners were in no way
related to each other and hailed from widely separated places.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Another instance is about two men born in
the same village who narrated their experiences after they had lived there for
a fairly long time. Their temperaments, behaviour and character were identical.
Both had pleasing manners, were always cheerful and never rude to anyone. Both
were robust in health and whenever one fell ill, the other also ailed from the
same disease.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Each of them lost a child in the same
month, and had the same number of children. One was a journalist, while the
other was a writer of fiction. Mercury, Mars and Jupiter were the signs who
ruled over their professions. The culmination in this extraordinary similarity
was in the death of these two natives on the same day.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yet another instance relates to a report.
that appeared in a foreign journal in 1820. It mentioned that Samuel Hennings
died at the age of 82. He was born on 4-6-1738 at a place situated in the same
Latitude and Longitude, as King George III, who ascended the throne in October,
1760. Mr. Hennings was then an independent business-man. King George III got
married on 8-9-1761 and on the same day Mr. Hennings took Elsie for his wife.
Both had the same number of children of each sex. Both were long-lived and died
at the same hour on 2-9-1820.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Instances can be multiplied for such
remarkably coincident happenings. The principles governing such events will be
explained in my magazine.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="01.6_Astrology-its Use and Limitations.html">← Astrology-its Use and Limitations</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_01.7_Branches of Astrology">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="01.8_Horary Astrology.html">Horary Astrology →</a></div></body>
