Horary Astrology. It has been widely practised by great scientists and very
learned scholars. The western system is explained most scientifically and their
arguments convince the readers. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It has already been said in this book that
in the western system, the commencement of the zodiac, differs from that of the
Hindu system; thereby the signs get changed; most of the planets are considered
to occupy different signs; so, the lords of the signs and the qualities as well
as characteristics attributed to the signs get changed. The westerners erect
the horoscopes according to Sayana system whereas we erect according to
Nirayana. They do not include the Nodes, while offering prediction, whereas they
take Uranus, Neptune and Pluto for judgment. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following extract is taken from the
book "Horary Astrology" by Dr. W. J. SIMONITE M.D., PH.D., with
additions by John Story and edited by ERNEST A. GRANT. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_Toc184334377"><span lang="EN-US">I. The time of
erecting a horary figure".</span></a></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">a. Many disputes have arisen about the
proper time for the figure of a horary question to be erected. Some think the
moment when the querent is first seen by the artist; others when he salutes
him, others when he inquires of him, etc. But the proper time is the hour and
the minute when the querent feels the most anxious about the matter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">﻿</span><span lang="EN-US">b. If a person apply to the Astrologer the figure must be erected
for the minute the querent proposes the question. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">c. If a letter be sent to an artist the
time of the letter being received is not taken notice of, but the moment the
artists reads the very questions. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">d. In sickness the time must be taken when
the person first spoke to the physician concerning the disease, whether the
querent is the afflicted party or not. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">e. If a parent bring the water of a child,
though the child cannot speak, the 1st house represents the child, and not the
5th, and so of the rest.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">f. If it be not a question but a sudden
event, take the moment of its commencement, as the setting off on a journey.
beginning a letter, or any business, etc., or when you first discover the loss
of an article. In all these cases the first impression on your mind is the time
and moment for the figure. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. The following extract is taken from the
book "Modern Text-book of Astrology" by MARGARET E HONE (page 272). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the question comes to an astrologer's
mind, he casts the chart for the moment of his thought, using the latitude and
longitude of the place where he is. If a person comes to an astrologer and puts
his request, the time of the request is taken. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Diversity of opinion exists as to the
procedure to follow when there is delay through the post. Some astrologers say
that the time of opening the letter should be taken, others stating that the
querent should give the time when the idea came to birth in his own mind. This
seems the more reasonable way. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The chart having been cast, the ruler of
the sign on the first cusp is reckoned to represent the querent, and the ruler
of the sign on the cusp of the house connected with the affairs of the question
is taken as its significator. Judgment depends mainly on the aspect formed
between these two, but many minor rules to be followed have bearing on this. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The practice of Horary Astrology was very
popular in the Middle ages, and its best known exponent was William Lilly
(1602-81). His Life and Works may be read, also a book of his aphorisms and
maps, edited by the astrologer Zadikiel (Commander R. J. Morrison). He states
that every rule must be meticulously followed, but unfortunately he himself
begins the book with Tables of Houses calculated for the Placidean System of
house division and follows by Lilly's maps, all calculated according to the
system of Regiomontanus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As many astrological students have accepted
the Placidean system because its Tables are the only one easily accessible, and
as few realise that Lilly died before this system was introduced into England,
it may be wondered why Zadikiel did not mention this.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Horary work, aspects to house cusps are
held to be as important as those to planets. This presented no problem to most
astrologers of the last few generations, since they accepted the Placidean
system and said their maps" worked". </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mr. LLEWELLYN GEORGE says in the book
"A to Z Horoscope Maker and Delineator" in page 569 as follows:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One branch of astrology called
"Horary" relates to the word "horus" meaning hour. It is a
system of divination based upon a chart cast for a certain hour and minute,
pertaining to a thought, question or event.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Horary Astrology bears out wonderfully the
idea of celestial correspondence to mundane affairs, exemplifying the sympathy
existing between the operations of mind and planetary vibrations. Through the
positions and aspects of planets chemical changes occur in the human organism
which have an important bearing on metabolism, and to a great extent determine
the anabolistic and catabolistic activities. These subjective states lead
people to think of and ask questions of importance at times when the planets
bear definite relation to the origin, nature and termination of the matters
involved.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">﻿</span><span lang="EN-US">In Horary Astrology very much depends upon whether an aspect is
applying or separating; whether planets are angular, succeedent, cadent,
dexter, sinister, etc. A number of considerations not usually employed in Natal
Astrology are used in Horary, such as collection of light, combustion, disposal
of, frustration, reception, refraction translation of light, void of course,
etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To become proficient in Horary Astrology,
one should first become very familiar with Natal Astrology, especially as
regards the casting of horoscopes, local time corrections, the nature of signs,
planets, houses and aspects.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This branch of astrology is useful for
answering specific questions which arise as the result of sickness, accidents,
journeys, news, reading a letter, receiving a proposition and other matters
which give a desire for information regarding the outcome.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Several-textbooks are available for the
study of this subject. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He adds in page No. 629 as follows: </span>——</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is important to know what things are
ruled by signs and planets and the places which they describe, as the knowledge
is valuable in reading horoscopes, natal and horary, particularly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To illustrate: A lady once said to me,
"I have lost an article of value. Can astrology give me any aid toward its
discovery?" I took the time when the article was missed and made a horary
chart for that date. As the Sun was in the second house I said, "The
article was round and golden". Yes, it was my watch". The ruler of
seventh house (the thief) was the Moon and it was in the fourth house. So I
informed her. "The person who took it was a woman and is right now in the
building where you reside. She is dressed in white, (Moon) is a common sort of
person. perhaps a servant or house-keeper; the Moon is in aspect to Uranus,
therefore she is not young and is peculiar in some ways; the Moon is in Aries,
therefore she is of fair complexion; her part of the house should be the top
and corner room; as the ruler of the Ascendant is in good aspect to Uranus,
ruler of the second (the valuable in question.) you can recover it by adopting
unusual methods". The lady recognized one of the maids from this
description who had a corner, attic room, was middle-aged and quite eccentric.
Instead of accusing her of theft the lady said, "I left my watch on the
table; I presume you put it away for safe keeping?" The woman was
speechless for a moment then said." Yes, madam, I took it upstairs and put
it on the top shelf of my closet where no one could see it". This incident
proves the practical value of astrological knowledge.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mr. Zadkiel says in the book, "An
Introduction to Astrology" William Lilly and A grammar of Astrology"
by Zadkiel. Thus :</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is the age of enquiry and yet
prejudice continues to press down her leaden foot upon the neck of examination
in the matter. I can only attribute the pitiable fact to the circumstance of
there being no recent publications on those parts of Astrology which are the
most easily acquired. The art of nativities requires many years of patient
experimenting before it can be well understood and practised with certainty and
satisfaction. The art of atmospherical astrology and also that of Mundane
Astrology alike demand much time to penetrate their arcana and a good education
to follow their practice. We may account for their comparatively confined
study: few have either the abilities or the opportunity to wrestle with their
difficulties.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But Horary Astrology, may be speedily
learnt by any person of even moderate abilities; and may be mastered in a few
day's study. It may be well understood and reduced to constant practice in less
than a quarter of an year, and no one will be at a loss for occasions to test
its reality or its utility; for his own avocations, and the affairs of his
friends will offer these almost daily. He may thus in 5 minutes learn
infallibly whether the affair will succeed or not".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="02.7_PADMAPRAPUSURI.html">← PADMAPRAPUSURI</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_03.1_HORARY ASTROLOGY-WESTERN SYSTEM WESTERN SYSTEM">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="03.2_WHAT EACH PLANET SIGNIFIES.html">WHAT EACH PLANET SIGNIFIES →</a></div></body>
