	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whether the astrologer will be able to predict immediately after the query or not is to be judged
		from the sub-lord of the 7th cusp. If the sub-lord is a fast moving planet, the query will be solved
		immediately. If it is a slow moving planet, there will be delay in analysing the problem. If Mercury is the
		sub-lord or if Mercury associates with or aspects the sub-lord then the querist will either correspond or send
		agent or will come second time to get his problem solved. If the sub-lord is node, it will have to be seen to
		whom they represent and then judged. (A node firstly represents the planet or planets with which it is
		conjoined, then the planet or planets aspecting it and lastly the owner of the sign in which it is deposited).

		moving planet. This indicates that the analysis will not be worked out immediately after the query. Mercury
		suggests that the querist will come once again to the astrologer, remind him and then get the judgment. He will
		be able to come only when the ruling planets then, will. reveal the actual results and the date of the event.

	<p class="block_4">Raid is generally result of some secret inimical activity resulting into loss of reputation and
		also money. Nowa-days, a few persons have amassed wealth by not submitting correct accounts and saved money
		either in this country or abroad. But, when their time is bad, the servants or the neighbours or some unreliable
		friends who gather information, during unguarded moments, betray, give information, leak out the truth and land
		the native in trouble.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 12th houses indicates sudden and surprising loss, confiscation by Government etc., by one's
		own wrongful acting, secret enemies, secret inimical activity, cheating etc. etc.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Who will betray and give information to the police is to be judged from the sub-lord of the 12th
		cusp. If the sub-lord of 12th cusp is connected with houses 3 (younger brother or neighbour) and 6 (open enemy)
		then one's own younger brother or neighbour will openly betray. If it is connected to houses 3 and 12 (secret
		enmity) one's own younger brother or neighbour will secretly give the information to the police. Houses 6 and 12
		indicate that servants will do harm. 11 and 12 show that the so-called friend or elder brother betrays the
		native. 9 and 12 indicate that either father or a stranger will be harmful. 4 and 12 show that the informant is
		in his own house, street or town. 7 and 12 threaten that either the partner in business, as soon as he severs
		connection, shows his true colour; or the native's wife, after divorce etc. will call on the police and give
		information.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 12th house shows loss of money, and also loss of reputation as it is 12th to 1st house
		(showing reputation of the native).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To ascertain loss of reputation and that of money, consider the 12th house and find out the
		significators. The significators are to found out in the following manner:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(i) The planets situated in the constellation of the occupants of the 12th house.</p>
	<p class="block_4">(ii) The planets tenanted in the 12th bhava.</p>
	<p class="block_4">(iii) Planets in the constellation of lord of 12.</p>
	<p class="block_4">(iv) Lord of 12 (lord of the sign in which the 12th cusp falls).</p>
	<p class="block_4">(v) Nodes firstly give the results of the planet or planets with which they are conjoined, then
		of the planet in whose constellation they are deposited, then the planets aspecting them and lastly the planet
		in whose sign it is deposited.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">All the above significators are connected with the 12th house matters and all of them can give
		12th house results but in varying degree.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore what one is to do is to find out the significators of 12th house, verify which of these
		significators are common with the ruling planets at the moment of judgment, find out the period that is running
		and that which is to follow and pass the judgment.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 12th house will be in everybody's chart. Significators of 12th house will also come in
		everybody's chart- Does it mean that everybody's house will be raided some day or the other? No! Then how to
		judge? Find out the sub-lord of the 12th cusp and see whether it is a strong significator of 12th house. If it
		is, then the danger of loss of reputation and also money is indicated. Otherwise not.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To find out the sub lord and analyse, a number 90 within 249 is given. The horary chart showing
		the disposition of the twelve cusps and the planetary position at the moment of judg ment is given above.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 12th cusp is 7 50 Karka, i.e. Moon sign Saturn star and Kethu sub. Kethu is deposited in the
		constellation of Sun who is in 12th bhava. Therefore the sub-lord of 12th cusp is a strong significator of 12th
		house. Therefore danger of loss of reputation and also money is indicated.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Kethu, the sub-lord of the 12th cusp, is deposited in lagna in the sign Leo owned by Sun and also
		Kethu is conjoined with Mercury. Therefore Kethu represents both Sun and Mercury. Sun is owner of Ist (native)
		and occupant of 12th (secret inimical activity), Mercury is occupant of 1st bhava and owner of 2nd (one's own
		family) and 11th (friend or elder brother). Therefore because of the consultant's own wrongful actions (houses 1
		and 12) either his elder brother (11th house) or a family friend (houses 2 and 11) will secretly (12th house)
		give information to the police who, in turn, will raid the native's house during the conjoined period of the
		planets common in significators and the ruling planets at the moment of judgment.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 12th bhava is occupied by Sun and Moon. It is owned by Moon Kethu in Simha represents Sun. No
		planet is in any of the three stars, Aswini, Magha and Mula owned by Kethu. Jupiter is posited in the Hastha
		star owned by Moon and Kethu is deposited in Uttarapalguni star owned by Sun.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore the significators of the 12th house are Sun, Kethu, Jupiter and Moon.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Let us find out the ruling planets. They are the lords of the day, rasi, star, lagna and lagna
		star at the moment of judg ment. The lord of the day is Mars, that of rasi is Moon, of star is Mercury (who is
		represented by Kethu as it conjoins with Kethu) and the lagna falls in Uttarashada star owned by Sun in the sign
		Makata governed by Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore the ruling planets are Mars, Moon, Kethu, Mercury, Saturn and Sun.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The common in the ruting planets and the significators are Sun, Kethu and Moon.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now let us see what dasa-bhukti he is running. Balance of Mercury Dasa is 14 years 11 months and
		8 days. As Mercury is no way connected with raid, you need not fear till Mercury Dasa ends. It ends on
		20-7-1984. (A doubt may come is somebody's mind that whether the native will be alive till this date, Let us
		see. Judge the 8th house which shows one's longevity. No planet is in 8th. It is owned by Jupiter. Also, Jupiter
		aspects 8th house. Therefore it gives long life to the native who is at present 30 years old) After Mercury,
		Kethu Dasa starts. Kethu is a strong significator of 12th. It is a ruling planet at the moment of judgment and
		also the sub-lord of the 12th cusp. Therefore Kethu Dasa Kethu Bhukti will be dangerous. It runs from 20-7-1984
		to 17-12-1984. In this Sun Antra operates between 23-8-1984 and 30-8-1984 and Moon Antra operates from 30-8-1984
		to 13-9-1984. Therefore somewhere from 23-8-1984 to 13-9-1984 loss of reputation and also money due to raid in
		the house is sure.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">For exact date consider the transit of Sun. Sun transits Sun star Moon sub in the sign Leo owned
		by Sun on 10-9-1984 Therefore, on this date there will be raid in your house.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334517" class="block_12">Which Gem will suit me?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">A few learned astrologers find that a particular planet in its period will give adverse results
		to a person. So to mitigate the evil effects they suggest the stone or gem governed by that malefic planet.
		According to Prof. Krishnamurti, it is wrong and actually doing harm to the consultant.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Suppose Venus has to cause Diabetes, if one suggests that sweets are governed by Venus and one
		taking much of sweets, will reduce the evil effects of Venus, how far this learned astrologer will be helpful to
		the patient.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Again, if Mars donates arrogance, independence, disobedi ence, etc. and thereby Mars threatens
		dispute among husband and wife, what is the meaning of suggesting to put on coral or ruby indicated by Mars or
		to keep ready a tathi or a knife or a revolver loaded, governed by Mars. Suppose due to evil Mars, one's hut is
		in fire, consider how wise the learned adviser is, if he suggests to pour highly inflammable ones on the fire,
		since inflammable ones are governed by Mars.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If Saturn indicates laziness, lethargic tendency and slow in one's action, how can there be any
		benefit by painting the wall with blue colour, purchasing blue cloth for curtain and blue car for his use. The
		result will be similar to an old (Saturn) deaf (Saturn) person crossing the road and the Saturn afflicted driver
		or owner delaying in reducing the speed by applying the brake. Readers know what the results would be.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If Moon is evil and it threatens loose motion, if one suggests a liquid purgative to the patient
		what will be the result? If Moon threatens, drowning in one's horoscope and if one uses. pearl according to an
		advice, do you know what will happen? Mind you, Moon will keep him for some hours by the side of the pearls at
		the bottom of the sea and after a few hours, lift his body up to the surface and carry the bloated dead body to
		the shores.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So, what is the wise suggestion? Prof. Krishnamurti says that when a house is in fire, we throw
		water and sand: when one is lazy, we give stimulant: when there is diabetes. we give insulin to control.
		Therefore, that which will nullify the evil is to be suggested. That planet which is auspicious, is to be taken.
		Its Gem alone is to be used. Therefore, people following Sayana system will be knowing the date of birth.</p>

		Saththan, Kurali, etc. But my sincere advice would be to pray to your Guru, the preceptor who puts you on the
		way and removes your darkness. It is said "Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur Devoh Mahaeswara." Hence in Guru
		you can find all the three; to produce anything you desire. to protect anything you want and to get rid of those
		which you wish. Hence I strongly recommend to have the blessings of your Guru. It will be much more effective,
		if you receive the blessings of Jagadguru, who never cared for his wordly pleasures, but took Sanyasin life in
		youth and daily spends most of the hours in doing Pooja to the idol which was worshipped for hundreds of years
		and who does Japa for hours. Further the people with whom he spends most of the remaining time are those who are
		religious or try to be religious, Godfearing, etc.. Such Gurus are considered as the incarnation of God to guide
		us and put us in the right path. People who have the fortune in the future alone, that is, those who have done
		meritorious deed in the previous birth alone can have such a Dharsan. All cannot have the chances to visit his
		place. Such of those can have the Dharsan of his disciples.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Today in India if anybody has the desire to meet such a Guruji and at the same time, one has
		neither time nor money, then they can simply pray to Him having the following photo. He is our Jagadguru,
		Kanchikamakoti Peetadhipathi Shri Sankarachariar Swamigal Avargal.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Astrologically</p>
	<p class="block_4">When you want to make a selection of God or Goddess, select those planets which are deposited in
		the constellation of the significators of the 10th and 11th houses and not the significators of 8 and 12 houses.
