medical officer or more than one medical officer will examine you before
issuing a certificate, declaring that you are absolutely fit, that you are not
suffering from any bodily informity </span>ог<span lang="EN-US"> incurable
diseases which are unfavourable for the nature of the work you have to carry
out or to go to a foreign country to work there, etc. (Luckily, such a medical
examination is not carried out on either of the sexes before marriage. If such
a bill is introduced, I am sure many will remain unmarried due to congenital
diseases like rheumatic heart, enlarged heart, etc.): therefore we have to
examine the 4th house to know whether there will be the medical examination as
you desire; then we have to see whether it will be favourable or not! 7th house
represents the medical officer whomsoever he is and 10th to the 7th, that is
the 4th house, indicates his job which means yourself being examined; the 11th
house shows whether you will be given a good certificate to make further
attempts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 4th cusp falls in Aquarius 6</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 45' 20", that is, it is in Rahu star and Rahu sub. Rahu is not
conjoined with any planet but it is aspected by Venus who is the significator
of the 11th, the 7th and the 12th. Therefore, Rahu as the significator of the
11th will allow you to appear before the medical officer for the medical
examination. As Rahu is in Saturn sign, you have to appear more than once,
since Saturn gives success after a few attempts or examination.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Disease is indicated by 6th; danger by 8th:
defect by 12th. Here, 12th house is not occupied by any planet but Venus is its
owner. Therefore, if it all, there is any defect it should be in the vision
especially in the left eye, since Venus is in the constellation of Sun and sub
of Moon: really, there should be something wrong with your eye. But luckily
Sun, Moon and Jupiter are in the 11th house. Moon is in its own constellation
and sub it is in 11th; Jupiter is in the constellation of Moon in 11 and sub of
Sun 11. Sun is in the 11th house, in the constellation of Mars and sub of Rahu.
All planets are connected with the 10th and 11th houses. Therefore, even though
there is the defect in the eye, yet you will get through the medical
examination and your desire will be fulfilled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="14.3_Any Study Overseas.html">← Any Study Overseas</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_14.4_Success in Medical Examination and Overseas">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="14.5_Will I go Overseas.html">Will I go Overseas →</a></div></body>
