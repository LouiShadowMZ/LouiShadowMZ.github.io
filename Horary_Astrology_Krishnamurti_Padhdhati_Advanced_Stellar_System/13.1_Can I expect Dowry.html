easily cashable valuable metals, jewels, vessels, vehicles, etc. These are
indicated by the second house. Since the consultant is expecting dowry from his
or her partner, then the second house to the 7th indicates the value of the
dowry, and the houses 6 and 11 denote the partner giving the money as present
and the consultant accepting it. Therefore, the sublord of the eighth cusp must
be deposited in the constellation of the planet who signifies the matters of the
houses 6 and 11. But if the sublord of the eighth cusp happens to be the
significator of 5 and 12, then the consultant is to give. Therefore, who will
give to whom is to be ascertained.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then the extent to which one can have the
dowry has to be judged, from the strength of the lord of the constellation in
which the sublord of the 11th is deposited. The sublord of the 11th may be
debilitated. Yet, if it were to be in the constellation of a planet which is
exalted, then most satisfactory dowry will be received.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even though the sublord of the 11th cusp
may be exalted, yet if it is in the constellation of a planet which is
debilitated, then the dowri will be less.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let me compare the debilitated planet for a
small container and exalted planet for a big one. If a debilitated planet is a
small packet, then the exalted planet, in whose constellation the debilitated
planet is, will be similar to diamond in that small packet. Similarly the
exalted planet is the huge container who is in the constellation of debilitated
planet which shows that the content's value is less like cotton ball. A big
cotton packet is not as valuable as a small packet of diamond. Small packet is
the debilitated sublord. Diamond is the exalted constellation lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is the way how we have to find out
whether a debilitated planet or exalted planet maintains its strength.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="12.5_Business and Partnership.html">← Business and Partnership</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_13.1_Can I expect Dowry">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="13.2_Will he be chaste.html">Will he be chaste →</a></div></body>
