</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Balance of dasa Mercury 5 years 8 months
ths Rahu 1.50 12 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What is lottery? It is a gain without
pains, bringing casual income. which is tax-free. Such an attempt will be made
during the period of a planet connected with 3rd house, counted from lagna. 3rd
house indicates lottery).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The query may be for the querist himself or
for some relative or friend. If the query is for himself, make all calculations
from the lagna. If it is for younger brother or sister, take the third house
counted from lagna as the ascendant for that younger brother or sister. If it
relates to mother, take the 4th house. To son or daughter take 5th. To wife or
partner, take 7th. To father take 9th and to elder brother or sister take 11th
and find out.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To know whether one will win at all, judge
the 11th cusp and find out whether the sub-lord of 11th cusp is either
retrograde or deposited in a constellation whose lord is retrograde. If either
is retrograde one cannot win. If the sub lord and the lord of the constellation
in which the sub lord is situated are in direct motion and if such a sub-lord
of 11th cusp is also a significator of the houses 2 or 6 or 11, then one will
win.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To note the sub-lord the number 3 is given
within 249 and the horary chart for this number at Bombay is as given above.
The planetary position is for the time of judgment. The 11th cusp is Makara 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 58' i.c, Saturn sign Moon star and Sun sub. Sun is never
retrograde. It is posited in the constellation of Rahu. Nodes firstly, give
results of the planet or planets with which they are conjoined, secondly the
lord of the star in which it is deposited, then the planet or planets aspecting
them and then the lord of the sign in which they are deposited. In the present
case Jupiter is aspecting Rahu and also Rahu is deposited in the sign Meena
owned by Jupiter. Therefore Rahu represents Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter is not retrograde. Rahu's motion is
always retrograde. But such a retrograde motion of the nodes should not be
confused with the retrograde motion of other planets.. The reason is that
planets, when retrograde, move in a direction which is opposite to the usual.
On the other hand the usual direction of motion of the Nodes never gets
reversed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the sub lord of 11th cusp is
neither retrograde nor deposited in the constellation of a planet who is
retrograde. Now, to know whether he will win or not, what remains to be seen is
whether the sub lord of 11th cusp is also a significator of house 2 or 6 or 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun is in the constellation of Rahu and sub
of Mercury. Rahu represents Jupiter. Jupiter is in 6th and Mercury in 2nd
bhava. Therefore you are sure to win. Further Sun is deposited in the 3rd bhava
(lottery). Therefore gain through lottery is promised,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house shows fulfilment of one's
desire. Whether the desire will be fulfilled or not is to be decided from the
planet or planets in 11th bhava and its owner. Saturn delays. Fast moving
planets fulfil the desire early. Others fulfil it in a medium time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In your case no planet is in 11th bhava.
Saturn owns it. Therefore delay is indicated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 2nd house is for improvement of bank
position, 6th for loss of opponent and 11th for gains and fulfilment of desire,
So consider the houses 2, 6 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2nd house is occupied by Mercury. Kethu is
in Mercury's sign Kanya. Moon is in Mercury star and Saturn is in Kethu star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6th house is occupied by Jupiter and Kethu.
Rahu is in Jupiter sign Meena. Therefore planets in the constellations of
Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu are strong significators of 6th house. Sun is in Rahu
star, Saturn is in Kethu star and Rahu is in Jupiter star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house is unoccupied. Saturn owns it.
Mars is in Saturn star. Mars is retrograde. This indicates that Mars will not
give results till it is retrograde. After that it will give.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the significators of the houses
2, 6 and 11 are Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 7th house shows opponent houses 2, 6
and 11 of the opponent are 5, 8 and 12, counted from lagna. Therefore the
significators of these houses will give gains without pains to the opponent.
5th house is vacant. 8th is occupied by Mars and Moon and 12th by Rahu.
Further, Moon, Mars and Saturn are owners of houses 5, 8 and 12 respectively.
No planets are in any of the stars of Moon and Mars. Sun is in Rahu star and
Mars in Saturn star. Therefore Sun, Moon, Mars, Saturn and Rahu are the
significators of houses 5, 8 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If these significators are excluded from
the significators of houses 2, 6 and 11, then the remaining significators will
give beneficial results to the querist regarding gains without pains, Therefore
these beneficial significators of houses 2, 6 and 11 are Mercury, Jupiter and
Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now let us find out the ruling planets. The
day is Saturday ruled by Saturn. Moon transits Mercury star in Vrischik sign
owned by Mars. The lagna is Dhanus owned by Jupiter. Both nodes Rahu and Kethu
represent Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the ruling planets are Saturn,
Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The common between the beneficial
significators and the ruling planets are Mercury, Jupiter and Kethu. Therefore
you will have gains without pains during their conjoined period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury Dasa is already on. As its dasa
balance is 5 yearsb 8 months and 12 days, Kethu bhukti is not to come. Jupiter</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">bhukti will run between 15-3-1970 and
21-6-1972. In the Kethu Antra will run between 9-3-1971 and 27-4-1971.
Therefore this period will give.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to transit, when Sun or Mercury
transits the 19th degree of Meena, you must get the lottery prize. (19</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Meena is Revathi star, ruled by Mercury, sign is owned by Jupiter
and sub is governed by Kethu.) Sun transits the 19th degree in Meena on
5-4-1971 and therefore on this date you will receive the lottery prize.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="10.12_Am I to adopt.html">← Am I to adopt</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_10.13_Can I gain in lottery_ When">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="10.14_Which relative will win.html">Which relative will win →</a></div></body>
