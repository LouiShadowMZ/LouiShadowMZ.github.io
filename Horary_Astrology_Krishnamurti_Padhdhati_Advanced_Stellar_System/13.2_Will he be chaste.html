occupying a dual sign and also if the sublord of the 11th is in the
constellation of a planet signifying the 7th house, the person will remain the

signifying the 6th even thought one may be moving with the other sex, yet the
other sex will not permit to proceed beyond a particular limit and thereby the
person has to necessarily remain chaste.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="13.1_Can I expect Dowry.html">← 8 HOUSE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_13.2_Will he be chaste">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="13.3_I Will I get scholarship.html">I Will I get scholarship →</a></div></body>
