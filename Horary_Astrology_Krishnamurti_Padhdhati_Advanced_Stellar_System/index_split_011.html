<h1 class="block_14" id="id_Toc184334468">7 HOUSE</h1>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334469">Can I buy him?</h2>
<p class="block_4">The whole world is like the rose. There are sweet smelling and beautiful flowers and also thorns.
		Good and bad both exist. Similarly there are men who can be bought and there are also those whom we cannot buy.
		There are immoral fellows and rogues, large in number who never hesitate to sell their souls and the bodies for
		money and for such favourites of those persons. Are there not instances wherein due to bribery and corruption
		the election was held void. Those who sell themselves do not consider that they become slaves. Also those who
		buy do not consider that such a practice is unfair, Only those who do not want to maintain dignity or
		self-respect accept and without any principle nor considering that he should be fair and just act in the manner
		in which the person who pays the bribe. This is not only in the election but in every quarters if that person's
		co-operation is needed.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If one is elected in that manner and he uses the political power for one's interests, it is a
		curse. It is the greatest blessing to the community if the person elected or the person appointed carries out
		his job intelligently and impartially, but according to convention and the rules and regulations prevailing.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Goldsmith was a gentleman of character whom nobody could buy. He refused to do dirty political
		work. He starved many days. He was arrested for having not paid the rent for his house. Johnson understood his
		poverty, met him; as Goldsmith could not accept anything from others as a gift, etc. Johnson took the manuscript
		of Vicar of Wakefield, sold it and paid the rent and released him. There are such honest people.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The experience has taught that such people whom you buy will never be your fast friend. If
		another person pays more, he will desert you. Also such people are never grateful. A person drawing salary every
		month from an office for something he does and acts against the interest of the employer. When such is the case
		how can you expect that he would stick on, be your permanent friend and ever help you. People with character
		should never try to buy. Do not tempt others and spoil them. Beggars increase in number because there are people
		to do charity. Hence those whom you buy are spoiled by you. The person would be unscruuplous, having the only
		principle to do favour to one who offers illegal gratification. So such a person is to be the benefactor and
		your desire is to be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Whomsoever you approach is judged from the 7th house. 11th house indicates both the benefactor
		and the fulfilment of one's desire. It also shows the success.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If the lord of the sub of the 7th house is deposited in the constellation of the planet
		signifying the 11th house then, you can straightaway buy him. But if the significator of 5, 8 and 12 happen to
		be the lord of the constellation in which the sub-lord of the 7th is situated then he will receive the money and
		cannot or will not oblige you. Have we not heard of people taking money from one party and voting for the
		opponent. Therefore judge the 7th cusp.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334470">When is the Marriage?</h2>
<p class="block_4"><span class="calibre3">"Sir, your students say that predictions based on the horoscope of a
			person may or may not be correct. All the position of the 12 cusps depend on the moment of the birth time
			taken. And you decide whether there is fulfilment of one's desire or not only from the sub lord of the cusps
			to be taken for judgment. Hence, it seems you prefer Horary to Natal chart."</span></p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Yes, undoubtedly. I reiterate that Horary is the best to get correct and amazing results."</p>
<p class="block_4">"For Horary am I to give a number? "</p>
<p class="block_4">"Yes, please mention any number between 1 and 249. "</p>
<p class="block_4">"Let me give 74."</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Suppose I give number 74 within 1 and 249 and the query is judged at Delhi at 7-30 A.M. I.S.T.
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">By 74 it is meant that Moon sign Cancer, Saturn star Pushya and 14° 53' 20" ruled by Jupiter is
		the lagna.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Then we have to find out the cusps of the other houses." </p>
<p class="block_4">"Will not the cusps vary from one place to the other?"</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"All places in the same latitude will have the same cusps even though their longitude may be
		different. Therefore one is to note the latitude of the place of judgment and not the place from which the query
		is put."</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"So, we have to take the latitude of Delhi."</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Yes. It is for Delhi we have to see. The latitude is 28-38 North. "</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Which Table of Houses do you recommend to refer ?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Till the Table of HOUSES prepared by me comes out, one should refer only the Raphael's Table of
		Houses and not anything else: we should avoid calculations. Even he who claims that he is good in Higher
		Mathematics failed in Elementary Mathematics which I pointed out in my October 1967 issue. One may be M.A. yet
		he can err. Therefore as far as possible avoid calculations when ready reference table is there. So refer to
		Raphael's Table and when mine is released refer to mine."</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">“Sir, the Table of Houses is in Sayana position. Is it not?"</p>
<p class="block_4">"Yes. So you have to note the ayanamsa on the day of judgment.“</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Which Ayanamsa am I to follow?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Follow Krishnamurti Ayanamsa. Forget all others. When Krishnamurti Ayanamsa is used and by using
		the subdivision of a constellation you come correct in minute details, it goes without saying that the other
		ayanamsa are not to be followed, especially if it varies by degrees? Follow only mine.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">What is the Ayanamsa now?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">23 degrees 20 minutes. So you add this figure to the position you got for the number you gave,
		i.e. 74. Hence add 23-20 to 14-53-20. Then the Sayana position of the lagna would be 8 degrees 13 mts. 20 ses.
		Turn over the page where the cusps of various houses are given for Delhi Latitude. Then you will get that Virgo
		9-32 is the second cusp Libra 8-32 is the third cusp; fourth will be 10-32 Scorpio; fifth will be 13-32
		Sagittarius; sixth will be 15-32 Capricorn and the other 6 cusps are 180 degrees opposite to these.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Now we have got the Sayana position of the 12 cusps.. Deduct the Ayanamsa and convert them to
		Nirayana. The following figure is the map for the query and hereafter we have to note down the position of the
		planets.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">For which time are we to note the position of the planets? If you judge a chart immediately after
		calculations, then you have to note the position of the planets at which you start the casting of the horoscope
		for judgment. Cusps for the number can be done and kept ready as a ready reckoner. You may keep a ready reckoner
		for any single locality for every number between 1 and 249. Noting the position of the planets and in
		continuation to judge will be done at any time. That time alone should be taken for the position of the planets.
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Then are we to note for 7-30 A.M. I.S.T. or are we to convert the time to L.M.T.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Hullo ! it is only to find the cusps of the houses one is to find out the time in L.M.T. But to
		calculate the position of the planets you have to take the Indian Standard time. Because the position of the
		planets are for 12 noon Greenwich. That is the same position for 5-30 P.M. LS.T. That is why I have given in my
		Ephemeris the position of the planets for 5-30 P.M. I could have given the position of the planets for 12 noon
		I.S.T. But you cannot verify easily with that of Western Ephemeris and confirm that mine is correct. So one can
		work with confidence. Doubt should never be there. Therefore you calculate and insert in the map after deducting
		ayanamsa from the figures obtained. Then the following is the horoscope for Judgment:-</p>

<p class="block_4">Mercury Dasa at the moment of judgment balance 5 years, 11 months 20 days. We have to presume
		that Mercury Dasa Rahu Bhukti started on 30-1-68.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">First Question: Is marriage promised?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Note where the seventh cusp falls, it is in Capricorn at 14-53-20. It is Moon star Jupiter sub.
		What does Jupiter signify? Jupiter is occupying the second house promising increase in the number of the members
		of the family by marriage. Hence marriage is promised.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Second Question:-Who are the significators of the houses 2, 7, 11 which houses denote the
		wedding?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Occupant of the constellation of a planet is stronger than the occupant. Occupant of a house is
		stronger than the lord of the house. This is the main principle of Krishnamurtiji.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore find out the occupant, of these houses and the planets, if any deposited in the
		constellation of the occupant. Then note down the occupant. Later find out the planets situated in the
		constellation of the owners of the signs in which the cusps of the houses 2, 7 and 11 fall. Finally take the
		lords of the houses as well as those planets conjoined with or aspected by the above significators.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Second house extends from 16-12 Leo to 15-12 Virgo (you have to take cusp to cusp as a house and
		not like the traditional astrologers, if you want to follow Krishnamurti Padhdhati.) Mercury, Kethu and Jupiter
		are the occupants of the 2nd house. No planet is in Kethu constellation. Rahu is in Jupiter's star; Moon, Sun
		are in the star of Mercury.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Seventh house extends from 14-53-20 in Capricorn to 16-12 in Aquarius. No planet is found in this
		arc.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Eleventh house extends from Taurus to 22-12 Gemini. Venus is in this area and the three
		constellations of Venus are Bharani. P.P. Guni and Poorvashda. Saturn and Mercury are the two planets in its
		star. Therefore the strongest are Mercury, Rahu, Jupiter, Kethu, Saturn, Venus, Moon and Sun.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Now the question arises how to select the strongest and the fruitful ones.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Krishnamurtiji has discovered that the ruling planets at the moment of judgment will be helpful
		and they are the real benefactors. Today it is Wednesday governed by Mercury. The star is Ashlesha ruled by
		Mercury. The sign is governed by Moon, Cancer. Lagna falls in Leo, Kethu and Rahu are the two nodes which will
		represent Mercury as Kethu is conjoined with Mercury and Rahu is aspected by Mercury. Krishnamurtiji has said
		that Rahu or Kethu will give first of all the results indicated by the planets with which they are conjoind or
		by which they are aspected.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Hence include the two nodes, Reject Sun, take Kethu. Then when will the marriage come up?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Mercury Dasa Rahu Bhukti Kethu Anthra or Mercury Dasa Rahu Bhukti Moon Anthra. Mercury Dasa Rahu
		Bhukti Kethu Anthra is mostly over. Moon Anthra will start after 7 months 24 days, i.e. on 7th April, 1970. It
		will run for 2 months and 16 days. Now we have to see in which constellation and sub the significators will be
		transitting. As Mercury and Moon are fast moving, take Rahu. Rahu comes to its own constellation on 7th
		February, 1970. Then it will be in Venus sub till 25th April, 1970. Then it will be in Kethu sub which is also a
		strong significator. Mercury will enter into Rohini star governed by Moon in Venus sign. Hence the date of
		marriage will be on the day when Sun transits in Venus sign, Moon star, Rahu sub, i.e.. 25th May, 1970.</p>

<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">7th house indicates husband, marital happiness and with legal husband. 2nd house indicates family

		partner,</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore for reunion with husband and perfect domestic facility, consider houses 2, 7 and 11-
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The significators are:</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(1) Planets posited in the constellation of the occupant of houses 2, 7 and 11.</p>
<p class="block_4">(2) Occupants of houses 2, 7 and 11.</p>
<p class="block_4">(3) Planets posited in the constellation of the lords of houses 2, 7 and 11.</p>
<p class="block_4">(4) Lords of houses 2, 7 and 11..</p>
<p class="block_4">(5) Planets who are in conjunction which or aspected by the significators.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(a) 2nd house is vacant. 7th house is occupied by Saturn. Pushyam. Anuradha and Uttarabhadra are
		ruled by Saturn. Saturn himself is posited in Uttarabhadra. So Saturn is a significator.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(b) 2nd house is occupied by no planet. 7th house is occupied by Saturn. 11th house is vacant. So
		Saturn is a significator.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(c) 2nd lord is Mercury. 11th lord is also Mercury. Mercury rules the constellations, Aslesha,
		Jyeshta and Revathi. No planet is posited in any one of these constellations. 7th lord is Saturn. Saturn himself
		is posited in his own constellation. So Saturn is a significator.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(d) Lord of 2 and 11 is Mercury. Lord of 7th house is Saturn. Therefore Mercury and Saturn are
		significators.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(e) Saturn aspects Rahu powerfully. Mercury is in conjunction with Jupiter.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore the significators indicating reunion with husband and domestic facility are Saturn,
		Mercury, Jupiter and Rahu.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The planetary period of Mars is in operation at the time of query. It is to run upto 17-2-1968.
		Mars is not a significator indicating reunion and domestic facility. He is posited in the constellation Rohini,
		ruled by Moon and is in the sub of Jupiter. Moon rules the 12th house indicating separation of husband and
		Jupiter rules the house indicating sorrow due to husband. Therefore Mars will not contribute to the growth of
		cordial relations with the husband. As Jupiter is also lord of 5th house, relation with the husband will not be
		snapped. There is also no danger to the life of your husband as Jupiter holds the lordship of your
		"Mangalyasthana" (8th house) and the 7th lord, Saturn is posited in his own constellation, Uttarabhadra.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">From 17-2-1968 onwards the planetary period of Rahu commences.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Whether Rahu contributes reunion and domestic facility?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">A planet offers the results of the lord of the constellation in which it is posited. The affairs
		pertaining to the houses over which the lord of constellation holds lordship will be experienced by the native
		predominently. The sub will indicate the net result.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Rahu is posited in the constellation Krithika. Krithika is ruled by Sun. And Sun holds the
		lordship of 1st house. 1st house indicates honour, dignity, glory, comfort and happiness.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Rahu is posited in the sub of Jupiter. Jupiter holds lord-ship of 5th house and 8th house. 5th
		house indicates recreation and pleasure. 5th house is 11th (permanent tie) to 7th house (husband). 8th house is
		your (Mangalyam"). It is 2nd house (comfort from family) to the 7th house (husband).</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore Rahu who is posited in the constellation of lord of 1st house and who is in the sub of
		lord of 5 and 8, is a strong significator indicating reunion and domestic facility. You are sure to meet and
		move with your married partner and will have marital bliss and domestic comfort during the planetary period of
		Rahu.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Sir, the planetary period of Rahu runs for 18 years. If so, when my husband will meet me and I
		will have the pleasure of moving with him", asked the lady quite interestedly.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Madam!</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">What you told is correct. Rahu rules 18 years. Naturally you are interested to know which year,
		which month and which day you will meet your husband and move with him with comfort and joy.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Our ancient sages have divided the planetary periods into sub periods and each sub periods rules
		certain period which runs a few years. Again each sub period is divided into sub sub periods which runs a few
		months.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Planets posited favourably with the major lord will always help, assist and co-operate with the
		major lord in giving the expected result. Planets inharmoniously disposed with the major lord will bring
		obstacles and cause delay.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Whether a planet is favourably placed or not, is to be ascertained from the longitudinal distance
		between planets. Saturn is very favourably placed towards Rahu. Mercury is also favourably placed towards Rahu.
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The first sub period in the Rahu major period is Rahu sub period itself which runs 2 years 8
		months and 12 days. The sub period of Rahu is again divided into sub sub (Anthara) periods. The first sub sub
		(Anthra) period in the sub period of Rahu belongs to Rahu himself which runs for 4 months, 25 days and 48 Ghatis
		from 17-2-1968.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Rahu is a strong significator. Therefore it is during this period, i.e., between 17-2-1968 and
		13-7-1968 you will meet your husband.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">On what date?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The ruling planets at the time of query are the ruling planets at the time of fructification of
		the expected result. The week day the query is put, is Thursday. Thursday is ruled by Jupiter. The query is put
		when Leo is rising in the east. Leo is ruled by Sun. The Moon is in the constellation Avittam, in sign Aquarius
		at the time of query. Avittam is ruled by Mars. Aquarius is ruled by Saturn. Therefore the ruling planets at the
		time of query are Jupiter, Sun, Mars and Saturn. The same planets will rule at the time of return of your
		husband. The planetary period that will be ruling then will also belong to these planets only.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The planetary period of Rahu is in operation. Rahu is a shadowy planet. It reflects the results
		of the planets with whom it is in association and also in aspect of. Rahu is in association with Sun and Mars is
		aspected by Saturn. Therefore Rahu is to act as agent of Sun, Mars and Saturn. Thus the lord of the planetary
		period has reflected the ruling planets of the query. Sun, Mars and Saturn leaving aside Jupiter. Therefore the
		major period of Rahu, the sub period of Rahu, the sub sub period of Rahu and the sookshma period of Jupiter will

		significator of the houses 2, 3 and 7. As a significator of 7 aspected by lord of lagna it shows that there will

		Venus Dasa for some time wife goes away and then returns. Unless Venus has got such matters shown according to

<p class="block_4">Jupiter Dasa balance 3 yrs. 2 mths. 5 days. Note the sub lord of the seventh. If it is connected
		with houses 6 and 12, the partnership will break. If it is connected with houses 5 and 11, more permanent tie is
		to be correctly predicted.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Why not boldly predict." </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Boldly anybody can predict." A child of 3 years can predict that its expectant mother will
		contribute to younger brother to itself. It may or may not come true. If it comes true, is the child an
		astrologer. If it fails is astrology a failing science or can the child escape saying that astrology shows only
		the Tendency. Correct prediction by following Krishnamurti Padhdhati alone is useful. So I say, predict
		precisely and correctly?"</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"7th cusp is in 12°53′ 20″. It is in Venus sign Moon star Rahu sub!</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"What results, i.c. which house matters does Rahu indicate? "</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Rahu is in Pisces in 8° 41'</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">It means it is in Saturn's star Uthrapadra. When we refer to Krishnamurti Padhdhati table, Rahu
		is in Venus sub.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Rahu is to give the results of the house occupied by the lord of the constellation. The matter of
		this house will be materialising, if the sub lord of the position occupied by Rahu is in direct motion. If the
		sub lord is retrograde, it means that the matter indicated by the house occupied by the lord of the
		constellation will appear to come through, but during the period or sub period of the sub lord, it will fall
		through.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Here Rahu is in the constellation of the planet in 5, promising union, denying separation and the
		sub lord Venus in direct motion in S. promises harmony and continuity of the partnership.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore, this partner will continue. If the circumstances, now, threaten that it will end, do
		not bother; good understanding will be had to continue the partnership.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Suppose, I give some other number, will it not change the result?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">You cannot give any other number. It is an unknown, unseen force which cannot be shown by doing
		any laboratory test which mysterious force without your knowledge forces you to give only that number, which
		will guide the astrologer correctly.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">For the same time, ie 7-30 A.M. 19-2-69 which number will show that the partnership will break
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">I told you that if the sub lord of the 7th cusp is in the significator of either of the houses 6
		or 12 partnership will break. So, if the 7th cusp falls in Aries and the sub lord is again Rahu, then Rahu will
		be in the constellation of Saturn in 6 and sub of Venus in 6 and Venus in direct motion will surely bring
		separation in the period and sub period of the significators of the 6th and 12th houses.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If Venus is in retrograde motion, attempts will be made to separate but separation will not be
		there.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If the sub lord of the 7th cusp is the significator of 6th house, partner takes the initiative,
		the partner is bent on separation and thereby the partnership breaks.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If the sub lord of the 7th cusp is the significator of 12th house, then the querist is bent on
		separation and he gets separated.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">So, if you would have given the number 137 then 18° 6' 40" will be the ascendant in Libra: 7th
		cusp will be 18° 6' 40" Aries which is Rahu sub in Venus star. The 6th cusp will be 20° 6' 40" in Pisces: Saturn
		and Venus will be in 6. The partner will try and get out. If you would have mentioned the number seven, then the
		ascendant will be 7° 33' 20" Aries. Sub lord will be in Rahu star and Rahu sub. The sub lord Rahu will be in the
		constellation of Saturn and sub of Venus in 12 and you yourself will leave him, drop him and drive him out
		smoothly (sub lord Venus is for smoothly, smilingly as friends get separated: if the sub lord is Mars, violence:
		if it is Jupiter, by compromise or through Court; if it is in Mercury, by giving notice. and paying his share in
		instalments and so on).</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If you would have mentioned a number so that the sub lord of the 7th cusp is deposited in the
		constellation of a planet or node in 6 or 12 and in the sub of Jupiter (which is retrograde) then there will be
		the mind to separate, but it will not materialise.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Thus partition among brothers, divorce, separation from wife or husband or demise can be found
		out. 3 and 12 houses show separation from mother: 3, 5, 10 and 12 demise 4 and 12 houses indicate separation
		from children: 4, 6, 11 and 12 show death. 6 and 12 from partners; 1, 6, 8 and 12: 8 and 12 separation from
		father 8, 12 death; 10 and 12 separation from elder brother; 5, 12, 10 demise, and so on. 1 and 12 show
		separation from family: 3 and 12 show separation, leaving the present permanent residence and living in a
		close-by locality: 9 and 12 show separation and life in a far off distant place.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Sir, as partnership should naturally and inevitably come to an end when either of us take eternal
		rest, when do you expect it?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Your ascendant-Horary is in a fixed sign. Lord of 9 is a Bhadhakasthana adhipathi Bhadhakasthana
		the 9th is unoccupied Owner is Moon, Jupiter and Mercury are in Moon's star. Kethu is in Mercury's sign. Hence
		tour end will be in Mercury Dasa Kethu Bhukti Jupiter Anthra. As you had 3 years 2 months and 5 days in Jupiter
		Dasa, then 19 years of Saturn and at least 3 years of Mercury. Hence for 25 years more you are wedded to him in
		the business.</p>
