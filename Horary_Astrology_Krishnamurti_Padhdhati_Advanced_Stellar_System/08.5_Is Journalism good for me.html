has the desire to become a Journalist and he puts the query, one has to judge
whether the sub-lord of the 11th cusp (indicating his success) is deposited in
the constellation of a planet which is the significator of the houses 3 and 9
and if the sub-lord is in any manner connected with Jupiter or Mercury or both.
If the sub-lord happens to be Venus, one will be writing much about the
marriage, sex, love affairs, Chemistry etc. But if is Jupiter, most sensible and
useful articles will be written and the books published will be popular.
Considering the natural quality of the planet one has to fix the subject of the
book which one will write.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
