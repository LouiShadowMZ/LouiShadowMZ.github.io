Saturn sub. The 3rd cusp falls at 6-42 in Virgo, i.e. Mer cury sign Sun's star
and Mercury sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Analysis:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Will I move at all? </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b)Will I be lucky thereafter? </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Where will I go?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Will I move? Note the sub-lord of the 4th
house as the fourth house indicates the present place of residence. Here the
4th cusp falls in Libra at 8 degrees 42 minutes. The lord of the constellation
is in 10 and the sub-lord Jupiter is in 12. Hence, you will surely move. As the
lord of the constellation is the significator of the 10th house the cause of
moving from one place to the other is only your profession,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Will I be lucky? Movement will be given by
the significators of the third house. If the significator of the third house is
also the significator of the second, tenth and the eleventh then you will have
gains in the place to which you move. But if the significator of 3 is also the
significator of 8 and 12 then you will move to lose whatever you have. This is
applicable both to the natal and Horary chart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Horary chart you have to note the sub of
the third house which indicates the change of place. If the sub-lord is the
significator of 2 or 10 or 11 one will make money and improve his lot. If the
sub-lord of the third cusp is the significator of 8 and 12 then the move adds
more difficulties.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In your chart the lord of the sub where the
third cusp falls, is Mercury. Mercury as lord of 3 will assist in moving from
one place to the other, as lord of 12 it shows life in another place, as the
depositor of the 10th house, it brings money by business, mostly agency, and
being in the constellation of Sun, lord of 2 in 11 promises profit, social and
financial success. Hence you will move and you will be lucky.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Where will I go? As the sub-lord is
Mercury, you will go to one place first; not finding that it is no good, you
will further move. Plurality is indicated by Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out this one has to refer to the
periods-dasa, bhukti. Now you are running, according to the horary chart,
Saturn Dasa Saturn Bhukti. It is lord of 6 and 7 deposited in the 8th house in
its own star and sub. Hence during Saturn Bhukti you must continue to stay
here. Only when Mercury Bhukti starts, you will go. It will be after 7th June,
1968.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Oh, God. Everyday is a hell. How can I pass
two years. Nowadays I do not have telephone to avoid the unpleasant
conversation with those who demand their money back. Also I go late home to
avoid the fellows who come to my house to demand money. I allow my wife to go
to bed and then I reach home. How long can I manage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally people are depressed and they
become despondent. Somehow they manage. The Sun counts the year. When good time
comes one begins to enjoy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Will I commit suicide by drowning?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">No, you will not die. You will borrow more
money from others and be drowned in debts only.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Alright. If at all I go where will I go? </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The third cusp shows only the moment. But
it is the 12th cusp which indicates the place of your stay outside. As the 12th
cusp falls in Gemini in Rahu star Jupiter sub, it will be a twin city and it
will be HYDERABAD, SECUNDERABAD. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thanks, sir.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(This person did not meet me later. I was
happy that he would not borrow from me also. In 1969 when I went to In 1969
Hyderabad I met him. He told that he was pulling on there since a few months.
When I asked him to give his address, he told that if he were to give his
address, I might in any casual talk mention about this prediction and the
creditors would chase him. So he said that he was temporarily put up with a
friend of his and avoided giving a straight answer.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="15.12_Any foreign assignment to me.html">← Any foreign assignment to me</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_15.13_Business Change of Place">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="15.14_Can I have a press of my own to publish books.html">Can I have a press of my own to publish books →</a></div></body>
