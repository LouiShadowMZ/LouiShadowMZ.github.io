they erect a horoscope for the moment of judgment and they read out results
according to the aspects which are being formed (applying) and also the aspects
which are separating.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Aspects: They do not include minor aspects
as they consider that they are not of any significance. But they take for
judgment only the following aspects. These aspects may be either between a
planet and a cusp of a house, or mutual aspects between two planets. The
aspects which are included are: the conjunction; the semi-sextile; semi-square;
sextile; square: trine: sesquiquadrate and opposition. When two planets have
the same geocentric latitude, it is said to be in conjunction. This is
considered to be good if beneficial planets conjoin. But if malefic planets
conjoin together, it is considered to be evil. semi-sextile aspect is moderate
in strength and it is advantageous. The longitudinal distance will be 30. The
Semisguare aspect is ever evil whether it is among the benefics or among the
malefics. It is of 45</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. The sextile aspect at 60</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> is considered to be more favourable than semi-sextile. But much
less than the trine. The sextile is of 60</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. The square
aspect of 90</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> is very bad, and very evil. The aspect
may be among two benefics or among two malefics. Whatever it is, this aspect is
very detrimental. The trine aspect of 120</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> is very
strong in offering most desirable results. Whether the aspect is among the
benefics or among the malefics, or between benefic and malefic, the
sesquisquarate aspect is of 135 and it is an unlucky one. The opposition of 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> is considered to be malefic if either of the two planets happens to
be a malefic. But if both of them: happen to be benefics then, even though
aspect is called opposition, yet the results will be agreeable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Orbs: In a horoscope (whether natal or
horary) the planets will not be always in the exact number of degrees as 30,
45, 60 and so on. It is to be remembered that every planet has got an influence
round its body. Uranus has 7</span>°<span lang="EN-US">, Saturn 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US">, Jupiter 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US">, Sun 15, Mars 7</span>°<span lang="EN-US">, Venus 7</span>°<span lang="EN-US">, Mercury 7</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and Moon 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If one wants to know whether the planets
are forming an aspect, taking into consideration the orbs, then one has to add
the orbs of both the planets and divide by 2. So take half of the sum. If the
aspect which is to be formed is within the actual distance plus half of the sum
(half the orbs of the two planets) then they are said to be forming the aspect.
The results also should be given as though they are having the aspect (applying
aspect).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Description of the person</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Please refer to Krishnamurti Padhdhati

book and note down what each planet signifies and also each house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What the 12 Houses Signifies</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I House: Health, one's mind, physical

judge, accurately. They limit the time by taking either the house or the sign
or by aspect. To find out the number of days, weeks, months and years, they
consider the actual distance between the planet and the cusp of the house or
among two planets and depending upon the number of degrees in between their
aspect, they predict the days, weeks, the months and years. Also, they include
in their prediction, in which house the planets are deposited. If the houses
are succedent ones, the result will be in so many months or years according to
the sign, being movable, common or fixed. But cadent houses give in months in
movable signs; years in common ones and far beyond in fixed sign. South
latitude increases the duration, whereas north latitude reduces.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">They also take the transit into
consideration and from the transiting position, they offer the prediction how a
matter will progress.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Distance: To find out the distance, they
select the planet which signifies the matter. If it is without latitude, the
distance is short. But if it is in North Latitude, it will be in furlongs
whereas if it is in South Latitude, it will be in miles. They calculate the
number of miles taking the number of degrees and minutes between the planet and
the significator and according to the distance in degrees and minutes, they
mention the same number of miles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn show two
miles for every degree. Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius for every degree
indicates two furlongs, whereas Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces denote
four furlongs for every degree. Therefore, from the number of degrees and
minutes, we have to multiply and give out the answer. Their principle of
judgment depends only on the aspects and the longitudinal distance</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Honestly speaking, however, much one may
master their system, one cannot give such a clear and precise answer as one who
follows Krishnamurti Padhdhati. The most scientific way of approach to this
subject is Krishnamurti Padhdhati and Krishnamurti Padhdhati alone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A few examples of the method followed by
the westerners will be given, when certain queries are answered using
Krishnamurti Padhdhati.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
