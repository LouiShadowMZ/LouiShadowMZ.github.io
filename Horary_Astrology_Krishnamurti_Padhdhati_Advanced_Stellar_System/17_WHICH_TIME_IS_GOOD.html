a significator of the 11th house and also either 6 or 10, you are sure to have
promotion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) Whom to pray:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrologically, while judging a horoscope,
note the planets which are very advantageous to fulfil one's desire; then make
a selection of a particular form of god or Goddess or any low form like
yekshini, Saththan, Kurali, etc. But my sincere advice would be to pray to your
Guru, the preceptor who puts you on the way and removes your darkness. It is
said "Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur Devoh Mahaeswara." Hence in
Guru you can find all the three; to produce anything you desire. to protect anything
you want and to get rid of those which you wish. Hence I strongly recommend to
have the blessings of your Guru. It will be much more effective, if you receive
the blessings of Jagadguru, who never cared for his wordly pleasures, but took
Sanyasin life in youth and daily spends most of the hours in doing Pooja to the
idol which was worshipped for hundreds of years and who does Japa for hours.
Further the people with whom he spends most of the remaining time are those who
are religious or try to be religious, Godfearing, etc.. Such Gurus are
considered as the incarnation of God to guide us and put us in the right path.
People who have the fortune in the future alone, that is, those who have done
meritorious deed in the previous birth alone can have such a Dharsan. All
cannot have the chances to visit his place. Such of those can have the Dharsan
of his disciples.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Today in India if anybody has the desire to
meet such a Guruji and at the same time, one has neither time nor money, then
they can simply pray to Him having the following photo. He is our Jagadguru,
Kanchikamakoti Peetadhipathi Shri Sankarachariar Swamigal Avargal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrologically</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you want to make a selection of God or
Goddess, select those planets which are deposited in the constellation of the
significators of the 10th and 11th houses and not the significators of 8 and 12
houses. You can refer to Krishnamurti Padhdhati. Advanced Stellar Astrology</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
