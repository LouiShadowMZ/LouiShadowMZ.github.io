Raphael give the various longitudes in Sayana. To convert them to Nirayana we
subtract Ayanamsa. Therefore, only correct Anyanamsa must be used to give
correct predictions. If Ayanamsa is not correct, the whole basis of the
calculations will be incorrect. There are several Ayanamsa in vogue. Of them
that which gives the correct timing of events is to be used.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is established by Prof. Krishnamurti
after a lot of creditable research work and experiments that, only those
Ayanamsas used and advocated by him give correct results. Others do not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Another never failing finding of Prof.
Krishnamurti is the Ruling Planets. He has proved that the ruling planets at
the time of judgment and those at the time of fructification of the event are
same. The ruling planets are the lords of the day, rasi, star and lagna at the
moment of judgment. Invariably in all cases, without any single failure, using
ruling planets one can decide correctly the nature of event and predict
precisely the time and date of its fructification. The ruling planets point out
the correct answers to any query. The nature of query may be anything like time
of birth, exact position of lagna, exact position of any other cusp, correct
birth star, correct position of Fortuna, time of marriage, time of delivery,
time of accident, time of death, etc., etc. the ruling planets will reveal the
results. In fact, ruling planets help us to give precise predictions regarding
any question even in the absence of birth chart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The query here is about delivery. Doctor
has given her a date somewhere in the month of November 1969. She wants to know
the exact date of delivery.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of query the lagna is Dhanus.
It is ruled by Jupiter,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The star is Dhanista. Its lord is Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The rasi is Makara owned by Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The day is Wednesday governed by Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the ruling planets are Jupiter,
Mars, Saturn and Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One should not make a haste and accept
these ruling planets as they come. See whether any of them is deposited either
in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet. If there is any, reject it.
Mercury is deposited in the constellation of Mars who is retrograde. Reject
Mercury and take Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, as the final ruling planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars is by itself retrograde. But it is
deposited in the constellation and sub of planets in direct motion. This shows
that Mars is not barred off from giving the results. But it will not be able to
give the results as long as it is retrograde. Once it becomes direct, it will
give. The probable date given by the Doctor is in the month of November 1969.
Mars is in direct motion then. Therefore Mars will give the results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore finally the ruling planets are
Jupiter, Mars and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When Sun transits a position in the Zodiac
ruled by the ruling planets, the event will fructify.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun enters the sign Scorpio ruled by Mars
on 16-11-1969, In Scorpio, there are stars of both Jupiter and Saturn. Which
star to be chosen? When a doubt arises, always find out who is stronger. (In
the ruling planets, the lord of the sign transited by Moon is stronger than the
lord of the day, the lord of the star is stronger than the lord of the sign and
the lord of lagna is stronger than the lord of the star). Jupiter, is the lord
of the lagna in the ruling planets. Therefore Jupiter's star is to be chosen.
In this, Mars sub is transited by Sun on 18-11-1969. The day is Tuesday ruled
by Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now check up whether transit of Moon agrees
on this date. Moon transits Jupiter star in Saturn sign Kumba on this date.
Therefore Moon's transit also agrees and the delivery will certainly take place
on 18th November, 1969.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The number given by the lady when asked to

unfavourable, especially when Mars is a ruling planet. Kethu in lagna and Mars
