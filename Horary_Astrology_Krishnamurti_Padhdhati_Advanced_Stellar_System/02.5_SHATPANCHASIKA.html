then for the benefit of Astrologers writes this work titled Shatpanchasika. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 2: The lagna rising at the moment of
the query indicates changes in one's position or rank or transfer from the
permanent place: the fourth house indicates success in one's attempts or
progress. The tenth house shows the stay outside one's residence. 7th house
indicates one's return, if the lagna or Navamsa Lagna were to be Seershalaya.
But if the lagna is occupied by a malefic or if the navamsa lagna is a
Prishtodaya one cannot be successful in his attempt. If the lagna or navamsa
lagna is connected with benefics and also malefics. one will come out
successful after facing difficulties. The planetary positions at the time of
judgment should be studied. One will return to his permanent place when any
planet enters into the fourth house. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 3: If the lord of a Bhava either
occupies or aspects its own Bhava or if a Bhava is occupied by any benefic, it
is auspicious in the results of that Bhava. But if a Bhava is occupied or
aspected by any malefic the results of the Bhava will be undesirable. This
principle is applicable both to the birth chart and also to the Horary (Prasna)
one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 4: An attempt will be successful if
(a) a benefic occupies the lagna, (b) the navamsa lagna belongs to a benefic,
(c) the lagna or navamsa lagna were to be Seershodaya. But if the lagna is
occupied by a malefic or if the navamsa lagna is owned by an evil planet or if
the lagna or navamsa lagna is Prishtodaya, one cannot be successful in his
attempt. But if both benefics and malefics are connected with the lagna or
navamsa lagnas, one will come out successful after facing difficulties. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 5: Strong Moon occupying the Lagna
and also receiving aspect from a benefic Jupiter or Venus, promises the
recovery of the lost property. Such beneficial result can be had if a strong
benefic is deposited in the 11th house. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 6: If a planet is in its own navamsa
and aspects its own in any of the Trikona houses, it means that the consultant
wants to know about some minerals. If a planet which aspects does not occupy
his own, the query will be about animals. If the planet which aspects is not in
it is own navamsa but aspect the navamsa in the Trikona sign. the question will
be about vegetable or agriculture. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 7: Alternate signs counted from
Aries, are called masculine ones. The nine divisions of these odd signs
indicate mineral, vegetable and animal kingdom in cyclic order. But in feminine
signs, one is to reverse the order. So note whether the ascendant is masculine
or feminine, find out the navamsa in which lagna rises and predict the nature
of the query. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">CHAPTER II </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 1: If Taurus, Leo, Scorpio or
Aquarius is the ascendant at the time of consultation, one will acquire a place
or position. This does not indicate any journey and return to home; it does not
indicate death or any loss. It does not show cure or failure (as the above
signs are fixed ones). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 2: If the ascendant falls in a
movable sign, just opposite results are to be expected. If the ascendant falls
in a dual sign, the result will be mixed. If either the Lagna or the Moon
receives aspects from benefics, one can predict success in one's attempts. If
the ascendant receives aspects from evil planets, success is not promised. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 3 If evil planets are situated in the
5th or the 6th house, the opponent or the enemy will return home (it may be
interpreted as follows: The opponent withdraws the case in the court). If the
fourth house is occupied by malefic, the opponent will be defeated ultimately.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 4: If the fourth house be Cancer or
Scorpio or Aquarius or Pisces the enemy will be defeated and he will return
with his cavalry. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 5: Success to a person is to be
predicted if the ascendant is in a movable sign, occupied by a benefic. Failure
is to be expected if malefic occupies such an ascendant. If the ascendant is a
fixed one, and evil planets occupy the ascendant, the result will be very
advantageous. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 6: If the ascendant is in a movable
sign and the Moon is in a fixed one, the arrival of the opponent is doubtful.
But if Ascendant is in a fixed sign and Moon is in a movable one, the opponent
will arrive. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 7: If the ascendant be in a fixed
sign and the Moon is in a common one, the opponent will come a long way but
retrace his own step.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 8: If the Moon be in a movable sign
and the Ascendant be in a common one, the opponent comes half the way and
returns home. If the Ascendant is in a movable sign and the Moon is deposited
in a common one and both are aspected by malefics, there will be the fight (or
war or litigation) and there will be loss for both. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 9: If the Ascendant is in a movable
sign, and if either Sun or Saturn or Mercury or Venus be in the Ascendant, the
opponent will march on speedily. But if Saturn, Mercury or Venus be retrograde
the enemy will not leave his permanent place. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 10: If the Ascendant at the time of
question be in a fixed sign and receives aspects from Jupiter and Saturn the
opponent will not leave his place': but he will arrive, if the ascendant is in
a fixed sign and is aspected by Jupiter and Saturn; and if evils are in three,
five and six there will be the fight. Evil planets in the fourth house indicate
that the opponent will retreat. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 11: If Sun and Moon are in the fourth
house, the opponent will not come. But if Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are in the
fourth house, the opponent will come quickly. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 12: If Aries, Taurus, Leo or
Sagittarius happens to be the fourth house counted from the Ascendant, the
enemy will return to his home whether these signs are occupied by planets or
not. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 13: If Jupiter or Saturn were to be
in the Ascendant, in a fixed sign the enemy would have left his place; he would
have halted on his way; if movable sign is the Ascendant, and Sun or Jupiter
were to be in the Ascendant, the enemy will surely arrive. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 14: Find the strongest planet and
note in which house, it is deposited. One can expect the return of a person in
so many months as is shown by the mumber of the house occupied by the strongest
planet. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 15: If the strongest planet is
situated in the Navamsa, in a movable sign, the above calculation is to be
made. But if the navamsa sign is an immovable one, the duration is to be
doubled. If the Navamsa sign is a common one, the period will be trebled. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 16: The return of a person is to be
expected when the lord of the 7th house begins to retrograde (if Capricorn or
Aquarius happens to be the ascendant this rule is not applicable at all). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 17: If there is no planet between the
lagna and the sign occupied by Moon, the opponent will arrive within so many
days as is indicated by the number of the sign occupied by Moon counted from
the Ascendant. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">CHAPTER III Success or Failure </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 1: Even when a ruler of a place is
opposed or attached by another, if either in the lagna or in the 7th or in the
10th house, benefits are deposited, one will win and come out successful.
Jupiter, Venus and Mercury in the 9th house also brings victory. But Mars and
Saturn in the 9th house threatens failure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 2: The houses 3 to 8 counted from the
Ascendant indicates the people in the place who are attacked if benefics are
deposited in these houses; victory is certain for the people. The houses 9, 10,
11, 12 and 1, 2 if occupied by beneficial planets, there will be success. But,
if in the 10th, 11th and 12th houses evil planets are deposited then the people
in the place will lose whereas those who attacked will win.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Slokas 3 &amp; 4: A compromise will be
arrived at or a treaty will be the result if benefics occupy 1 or 11 or 12 and
these houses happen to be two-legged-biped. If evil planets occupy common signs
there will be war to the end. In 1 or 4 or 7 or 10 if benefics are deposited
and aspected by benefics they will come to a compromise and the war will end in
a treaty. But if the Kenthra houses are occupied by the malefics and also
aspected by malefics war will go on to the last.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 5: If in the second or third house,
Jupiter or Venus or both are deposited, the enemy will go back very soon. Under
the same circumstances, anyone who would have gone abroad, will return back
soon without any doubt.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">CHAPTER IV</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 1: If evil planets do not occupy 1,
4, 7, 8 or 10 the benefics are in 1, 4, 5, 7, 9 or 10 one will realise first
ambition. If not, the result will be just opposite.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 2: There is success or progress if in
the 3rd or 5th or 6th or 11th or 12th benefics are deposited. If the ascendant
falls in Gemini, Virgo, or Aquarius and at the same time beneficial planets are
also deposited therein, one is to expect desirable results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 3: Improvement in status and
achievement of one's aims are promised by beneficial planets, occupying the
houses 7 and 10. If they are in the 1st or 2nd or 5th one can expect prestige,
power and money. Evil planets occupying the 11th or the 12th cannot reduce any
advantageous results. Moon in the ascendant does no good. But if it is 10th
house, it is beneficial.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 4: If Jupiter aspects Moon deposited
in 2 or 3 or 6 or 7 or 10 or 11 one can be happy, make gains, etc. through
other sex. But evil planets in 1 or 3 or 5 or 8 or 9 bring loss, cause fear and
also failure in one's attempts or business. But benefics in these houses are
advantageous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 5: Beneficial planets in I or 5 or 7
or 8 receiving aspect from other benefics and moon in Upachayasthana promises
recovery from disease if the person is ill.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">CHAPTER V</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Person in far off place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 1: If all planets occupy 2, 3 and 5
the person will return home early. If benefics occupy these houses the person
whom it would have been thought to be lost, will return and also the missing
article will be recovered. If Jupiter and Venus occupy the above 2, 3 or 5 the
person will return shortly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 2: The person will return home early
if Jupiter is in a Kendra sign and if planet occupies the 6th or the 7th house.
If Venus and Mercury were to be in 5 or 9 the person will return quickly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 3: Moon in the 8th house and Kendra
sign unoccupied by evil planets show that the person will return safely. Also
he will return with gains if in the Kendra signs benefics are found.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 4: If the ascendant is a Prishtodaya
sign and evil planets aspect it, the person is undergoing lot of trouble anp
may be imprisoned. If evil planets are in the third house and they are not
aspected by beneficial ones, that person would have started from his place to a
foreign land. If in the sixth house, evil planets are deposited the person will
be either dead or missing. He would have been kidnapped by robbers if the
malefics are in the Kendra signs (1, 4, 7 or 10).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 5: Note the planet which is in direct
motion next to the lagna; calculate how many rasis away from lagna it is. Multiply
it by 12. In so many days he will return; if the planet next to lagna is
retrograde, then he will return in as many days as the number of signs in
between the ascendant and the sign occupied by the retrograde planet.<br/>
<br/>
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">CHAPTER VI</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To Regain The Lost</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 1: A person related to the consultant
alone, would have taken the missing article and it is there only, if the lagna
falls in a fixed sign or the Navamsa lagna is in a fixed sign or if the lagna
is Vargothama</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 2: The article which is considered to
be lost, will be near the gate of the house, if the first 10° of a sign will be
the lagna. But if the lagna is between 10 and 20, the missed article will be in
the middle portion of the house; if the lagna falls between 20 and 30, it will
be in the backyard of the house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 3: Strong Moon in lagna or the lagna
is seershodhaya, occupied or aspected by beneficial planets, indicates that one
will recover the property, considered to be lost. If the 11th house is occupied
by a strong benefic, the property will be recovered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 4: Planets situated in the houses 1,
4, 7 or 10 indicate where the property that had been missed, would be.. It
indicates the direction by which it is taken. If there is no planet in the
Kendra house, then the lagna indicates the direction. The distance by which the
missing article is taken is to be ascertained by considering the Navamsa lagna.
The nature of the property lost is judged through the navamsa lagna:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) the rising decanate describes the
robbers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) the ascendant indicates the time, when
it was lost and also the direction by which and the place to which the missing
article is taken. The age, caste, and other particulars of the robber is judged
from the lord of the ascendant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">CHAPTER VII</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 1: Predict that a male child will be
born if Saturn is deposited in the houses 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11. If not, a girl will
be born. As regards marriage, if Saturn is in even houses, one will be
successful, otherwise, no.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 2: If Moon is in 3 or 5 or 6 or 7 or
11 receiving aspect from Jupiter and Mercury, marriage will take place. If
benefics occupy Trikona or Kendra houses, then also marriage will come up.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 3: If Venus is 7 to Moon and Saturn
is in 7 to Sun or if Venus and Saturn are in 4th and 8th houses, there will be
the rain during the rainy season.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 4: If benefics are found in the
houses 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 or 10 and such a house is a watery one, there will be
rain. If Moon is in the ascendant in a watery sign predict that there will be
the rain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 5: A male child will be born if the
lagna be in a masculine sign and also aspected by male planets. If the
ascendant be a female sign, receiving aspect from feminine planets, the child
will be female. If Mercury is situated in the ascendant, the lady will be
pregnant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 6: One would like to know about a
girl if Moon or Mercury either occupies or aspects the lagna. If Saturn.
occupies or aspects the lagna, the query will be about an old woman. If Jupiter
or Sun is situated in the ascendant or if they aspect the ascendant, the lady
in question would have recently delivered. The lady will be maintaining strong
health if Mars or Venus occupies or aspects the ascendant. The above principle
is also applicable for males.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 7: Strong planet in the lagna
indicates that the consultant would like to know about one with whom he is
closely connected. If the strong planet is in the third house, the matter will
be about one's youngster. If it occupies the 5th.it relates to one's offspring.
If the strong planet is in 4, the matter relates to the mother or sister. If it
is in 6 the query is about the enemy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 8: If it is in 7, about one's wife,
if in 9, it will be about a virtuous person doing meritorious deed. If it is in
10 it relates to one's Guru. If the Lord of the Navamsa lagna is strong in the
Horary lagna one will put questions about himself. If the Lord of the Navamsa
lagna is strong and is a friend to the Lord of the Horary Lagna, the question
will be about one's friend. If they are enemical, the question will be about
one's enemy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 9: If the lagna falls in a movable
sign and also the navamsa lagna, the question will be about one who has left
his place and gone overseas. If a planet has moved away from the 7th house and
it is not retrograde, he, who has gone out, will return. But if the planet is
retrograde he will not return.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 10: One will enjoy another man's wife
if Sun. Venus or Mars is situated in the 7th house. One will enjoy his own wife
if the 7th house is occupied by Jupiter. One enjoys a prostitute if Moon or
Mercury is in 9. One enjoys a woman of a very low caste if Saturn is in 7. From
the nature of the Moon, ascertain the age of the woman. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 11: He who has gone out will fall ill
in a foreign land if in the 9th house Saturn and some other evil planet are
deposited. He who has gone out will not return, but will die there itself, if
Saturn is in 8. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 12: One's father who had already left
his place will further move on to another country if Sun or a benefic or both
are in the 8th house, receiving aspect from another benefic. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus Prithuyasas has given various
principles in his book, Shatpanchasika". </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="02.4_UTHRAKALAMRITHA.html">← UTHRAKALAMRITHA</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_02.5_SHATPANCHASIKA">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="02.6_SINENDRAMALA.html">SINENDRAMALA →</a></div></body>
