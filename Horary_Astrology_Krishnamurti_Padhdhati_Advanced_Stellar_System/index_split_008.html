	<p class="block_4">To find out the time of celebration of the second marriage take out the significators of the
		houses 2 and 11 from the above table. They are Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Kethu, Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Venus and Rahu.
		All the nine planets are significators of houses 2 &amp; 11. When many signify, the best course to eliminate the
		tempors and select the beneficial ones is to go for Ruling planets. They are the lords of the day, Moon sign,
		star and lagna at the moment of judgment.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The day is Tuesday ruled by Mars, The rasi is Dhanus, owned by Jupiter. The star is Purvashada
		governed by Venus. The lagna is Tula owned by Venus.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As Rahu is conjoined with Venus and Kethu with Jupiter, take Rahu and Kethu also.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore the ruling planets are Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Rahu and Kethu. None of them is posited
		either in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet. Therefore consider all.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mars and Jupiter are themselves retrograde. But that does not prevent them from giving results.
		Only thing is that they are incapable of giving results as long as they are retrograde. Once they become direct
		they will give</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to dasa-bhukti, balance of Venus Dasa is 7 years 11 months and 12 days from 6-9-1969.
		In Venus Dasa, Jupiter Bhukti is running. Jupiter is lord of 11th. So you will have second marriage in Jupiter
		Bhukti. Jupiter Bhukti will run upto 18-2-1970. Jupiter will become direct on 23-5-1969. So it can give result
		during 23-5-1969 and 18-2-1970. In this period Mars Antra runs from 28-7-1969 to 24-9-1969 and Rahu Antra runs
		from 24-9-1969 to 18-2-1979.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To find out which of these two anthras will give the result, we have to judge who is stronger.
		Rahu is a node. It represents both Jupiter and Venus (i.e. lord of rasi, star and lagna in ruling planets).
		Therefore Rahu is stronger than Mars who is only day-lord in the ruling planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore Rahu anthra will give second marriage. To pinpoint the exact date of marriage consider
		the transit of the dasa lord Venus.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Venus transits Jupiter sub in Rahu star Swathi in the sign Tula owned by Venus on 13-11-1969. The
		day is Thursday owned by Jupiter. Moon transits Venus star Purvashada in Jupiter sign Dhanu on this day.
		Therefore you will surely have your second marriage on 13-11-1969.</p>
