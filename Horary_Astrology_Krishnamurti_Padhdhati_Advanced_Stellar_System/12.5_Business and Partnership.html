</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter Dasa balance 3 yrs. 2 mths. 5 days.
Note the sub lord of the seventh. If it is connected with houses 6 and 12, the
partnership will break. If it is connected with houses 5 and 11, more permanent
tie is to be correctly predicted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Why not boldly predict." </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Boldly anybody can predict." A
child of 3 years can predict that its expectant mother will contribute to
younger brother to itself. It may or may not come true. If it comes true, is
the child an astrologer. If it fails is astrology a failing science or can the
child escape saying that astrology shows only the Tendency. Correct prediction
by following Krishnamurti Padhdhati alone is useful. So I say, predict
precisely and correctly?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"7th cusp is in 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US">53</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>″<span lang="EN-US">. It is in
Venus sign Moon star Rahu sub!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"What results, i.c. which house
matters does Rahu indicate? "</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is in Pisces in 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 41'</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It means it is in Saturn's star Uthrapadra.
When we refer to Krishnamurti Padhdhati table, Rahu is in Venus sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is to give the results of the house
occupied by the lord of the constellation. The matter of this house will be
materialising, if the sub lord of the position occupied by Rahu is in direct
motion. If the sub lord is retrograde, it means that the matter indicated by
the house occupied by the lord of the constellation will appear to come
through, but during the period or sub period of the sub lord, it will fall
through.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here Rahu is in the constellation of the
planet in 5, promising union, denying separation and the sub lord Venus in
direct motion in S. promises harmony and continuity of the partnership.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, this partner will continue. If
the circumstances, now, threaten that it will end, do not bother; good
understanding will be had to continue the partnership.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose, I give some other number, will it
not change the result?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You cannot give any other number. It is an
unknown, unseen force which cannot be shown by doing any laboratory test which
mysterious force without your knowledge forces you to give only that number,
which will guide the astrologer correctly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For the same time, ie 7-30 A.M. 19-2-69
which number will show that the partnership will break</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I told you that if the sub lord of the 7th
cusp is in the significator of either of the houses 6 or 12 partnership will
break. So, if the 7th cusp falls in Aries and the sub lord is again Rahu, then
Rahu will be in the constellation of Saturn in 6 and sub of Venus in 6 and
Venus in direct motion will surely bring separation in the period and sub
period of the significators of the 6th and 12th houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If Venus is in retrograde motion, attempts
will be made to separate but separation will not be there.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord of the 7th cusp is the
significator of 6th house, partner takes the initiative, the partner is bent on
separation and thereby the partnership breaks.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord of the 7th cusp is the
significator of 12th house, then the querist is bent on separation and he gets
separated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, if you would have given the number 137
then 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6' 40" will be the ascendant in Libra:
7th cusp will be 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6' 40" Aries which is Rahu
sub in Venus star. The 6th cusp will be 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6' 40"
in Pisces: Saturn and Venus will be in 6. The partner will try and get out. If
you would have mentioned the number seven, then the ascendant will be 7</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 33' 20" Aries. Sub lord will be in Rahu star and Rahu sub. The
sub lord Rahu will be in the constellation of Saturn and sub of Venus in 12 and
you yourself will leave him, drop him and drive him out smoothly (sub lord
Venus is for smoothly, smilingly as friends get separated: if the sub lord is
Mars, violence: if it is Jupiter, by compromise or through Court; if it is in
Mercury, by giving notice. and paying his share in instalments and so on).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you would have mentioned a number so
that the sub lord of the 7th cusp is deposited in the constellation of a planet
or node in 6 or 12 and in the sub of Jupiter (which is retrograde) then there
will be the mind to separate, but it will not materialise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus partition among brothers, divorce,
separation from wife or husband or demise can be found out. 3 and 12 houses
show separation from mother: 3, 5, 10 and 12 demise 4 and 12 houses indicate
separation from children: 4, 6, 11 and 12 show death. 6 and 12 from partners;
1, 6, 8 and 12: 8 and 12 separation from father 8, 12 death; 10 and 12
separation from elder brother; 5, 12, 10 demise, and so on. 1 and 12 show
separation from family: 3 and 12 show separation, leaving the present permanent
residence and living in a close-by locality: 9 and 12 show separation and life
in a far off distant place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sir, as partnership should naturally and
inevitably come to an end when either of us take eternal rest, when do you
expect it?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Your ascendant-Horary is in a fixed sign.
Lord of 9 is a Bhadhakasthana adhipathi Bhadhakasthana the 9th is unoccupied
Owner is Moon, Jupiter and Mercury are in Moon's star. Kethu is in Mercury's
sign. Hence tour end will be in Mercury Dasa Kethu Bhukti Jupiter Anthra. As
you had 3 years 2 months and 5 days in Jupiter Dasa, then 19 years of Saturn
and at least 3 years of Mercury. Hence for 25 years more you are wedded to him
in the business.</span></p><span lang="EN-US"><br clear="all"/>
