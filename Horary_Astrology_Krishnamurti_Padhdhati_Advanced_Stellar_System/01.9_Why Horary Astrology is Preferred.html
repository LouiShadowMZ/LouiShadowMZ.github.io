<body><h2 id="heading_01.9_Why Horary Astrology is Preferred_0"><span lang="EN-US">Why Horary Astrology is Preferred</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out the events in one's life or to
know in advance the result of one's attempts or action, there are two methods,
They are Natal Astrology and Horary Astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. To erect a horoscope with 12 cusps and
insert the planets at correct position, the time of birth should be accurate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In India, the standard time was introduced
on 1-1-1906 and any birth before this date was noted down according to the
timing following by the postal authorities or railway authorities in that
locality. Before standard time was introduced even when our watches show
correct time, (agreeing with local time) yet the information given to the
interested parties after the birth of the child by the attendants differ one
from the other. Because, the medical attendants are anxious to do their job
than to note the time. A few give the time of Siras-udhaya. A few note the time
when the whole body of the child had been removed from that of a mother. There
are instances wherein midwife gave a time, the nurse mentioned another, whereas
the lady doctor differed from both of them. When such is the case which time
can we take even though the clock shows the Indian Standard time correctly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, the time of the birth is in most of
the cases are not correct at all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Whenever twins are born with a
difference of few minutes and we erect horoscopes according to traditional
system the picture remains the same for both except in the dasa balance. There
also the difference is only by a few weeks. The position of the planets do not
get changed, in the Bhava (House Division) nor they move at all even by a few
minutes. So the horoscopes of both the twins appear for predictive side more or
less same according to Hindu Traditional astrology: but Krishnamurti Padhdhati
shows the difference. There are many instances wherein the results enjoyed by
them are diametrically opposite. This shows that the moment of the birth of a
child should be very correct, when only the prediction will come out
accurately. If the time of birth differs by a few minutes then this horoscope
refers to someone else and not to the consultant. So the reading fails.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Any student of Astrology will not be
able to carry out the research for decades and decades and have a satisfactory
solution for the various problems within his lifetime. Honestly so many
centuries will be needed to carry out the research on Natal horoscopes to find
out the truth. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. But in Horary Astrology one takes the
moment of the judgment, makes a chart and offers the result. This horoscope
will be very correct and the result also will be amazingly accurate. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. One can understand the principles of
Horary Astrology within a period of three months and he can apply the
principles and in a year start carrying out the research on Horary Astrology
and find out the truth within a couple of years. One can master this subject
easily and offer useful predictions which come to pass. Horary Astrology is
genuine and simple. It is most useful, as one can have the results or the
solution for one's problem in a few minutes. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. In one's horoscope it may be found that
the person will have an agricultural farm but one cannot say which variety of
crop he will cultivate. But in Horary Astrology one can find out whether he
will have oranges or grapes or lime fruit or sugarcane, etc. Therefore, to have
exact and precise prediction Horary is useful. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. One may predict that the person will
purchase a house in a particular period. But in which street and which house he
will buy cannot be predicted from Natal chart. Horary Astrology is very useful
to make the selection out of the many. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. Similarly, a young bridegroom may have
to choose his wife from half a dozen brides suggested to him. Natal chart can
show that he will get married but it is difficult to select any and declare
that he would marry only a particular girl, whereas Horary Astrology is useful
to make the selection and definitely declare whom he will surely marry. Thus it
can be seen that Horary Astrology is most useful for one and all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9. Even in political Astrology when three
or four people compete for election a few may have horoscopes; a few may not
have at all. Even the horoscopes which they give may or may not be correct.
Further, when four horoscopes are given it is very difficult, to pitch up one
out of the four and declare that he alone will win. But in Horary Astrology
after one takes one number for each candidate then he can correctly predict who
would win in the election.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus Horary Astrology will be found very
useful in all matters to get precise answer.</span></p><span lang="EN-US"><br clear="all"/>
