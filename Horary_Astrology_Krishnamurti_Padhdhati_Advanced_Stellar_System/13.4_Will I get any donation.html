Any money received means your bank position improves-indicated by second house.
As it is given by another, to that extent it is a loss to him, the giver. As it
is a donation which need not be returned it is in full a profit. This is
indicated by the 11th house. As the giver is indicated by the 7th house loss to
him is shown by the 12th to the 7th,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In horary astrology, see that the sub-lord
of the 8th is in the constellation of a planet who is the significator of the
6th. The sub-lord of the 6th is the significator of 2 or 6 or 11. Then getting
a donation is promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="13.3_I Will I get scholarship.html">← I Will I get scholarship</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_13.4_Will I get any donation">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="13.5_Will I get money by way of Will from my uncle.html">Will I get money by way of Will from my uncle →</a></div></body>
