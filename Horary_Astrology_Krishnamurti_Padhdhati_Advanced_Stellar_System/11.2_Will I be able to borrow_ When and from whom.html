</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 6th house is the house which indicates
debt or borrowing. To know whether one borrows money or not, judge the 6th cusp
and find out whether the lord of the sub of the 6th cusp is either retrograde
or deposited in the constellation whose lord is retrograde. If either is
retrograde, one cannot borrow. If the sub lord and the lord of the
constellation in which the sub lord is situated, are in direct motion, then one
will be able to borrow. If it is Sun the loan will be from Government. If it
is. Moon, very quickly the lender will agree to give. If it is Mars, there will
be an atmosphere of tension in borrowing. If it is Mercury, one will
correspond, send agent and will borrow in instalments. If it is Jupiter, with
honour and by lawful means one borrows. If it is Venus, in a friendly way the
borrowing will take place. If the sub lord is Saturn, then there will be some
delay and obstacles in borrowing. If Saturn aspects the sub lord of the 6th
cusp, even if it is Jupiter or any other planet, one gets only a part of the
amount or gets the amount part by part.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In your case, the 6th cusp is 17 15 Aries,
i.e. in Mars sign Venus star and Moon sub, Moon is never retrograde. It is
posited in the constellation of Rahu. The motion of Nodes is always
unidirectional. Unlike retrograde planets it does not get reversed in motion. A
retrograde planet appears to change its usual direction of motion and moves in
an opposite direction. This retrograde nature of motion of the planets should
not be confused with the unidirectional retrograded motion of Nodes. So Moon's
deposition in the constellation of Rahu should not be interpreted as deposited
in a constellation whose lord is retrograde. The inner meaning of the term
retrograde here is the reversal of usual direction of motion and Nodes never
change their usual direction of motion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the sub lord of 6th cusp is
neither retrograde nor placed in a constellation whose lord is retrograde and
therefore, you will be able to borrow.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 6th cusp is in Venus star and sub of
Moon. Venus indicates that the borrowing will be in a very friendly manner.
Moon denotes that the lender will quickly agree to give you the amount. But
Saturn aspecting Moon foreshows that he will not give you full amount. But a
little less. The sign lord Mars portends that you will be upset and angry in
your mind because he agrees to give you little less than what is requested.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now to know the time of event consider the
ruling planets. The day is Sunday owned by Sun. Moon is in Mercury sign and
Rahu star. Kethu is in Mercury sign Kanya. The lagna is Dhanus owned by
Jupiter. Kethu and Jupiter are conjoined in Kanya. So Kethu is very strong.
Therefore the ruling planets are Sun, Mercury, Rahu, Jupiter and Kethu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As you are to get the amount very soon
(because the sub lord is Moon), the dasa-bhukti method will not be useful here.
Very soon means within a month or so. In all such cases wherein the result is
anticipated within a month or so, consider the transit of Moon and predict.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The strongest of the ruling planets is the
lord of lagna. It is Jupiter here Kethu conjoined with Jupiter is stronger than
Jupiter to give the result. Kethu is doubly strong because it also represents
Mercury, another ruling planet. So Moon must transit in Kethu star. Kethu star
Aswini is in Mar's sign Mesha, Makha is in Sun's sign Simha and Mula is in
Jupiter sign Dhanus. Mars is not a ruling planet. Sun and Jupiter are ruling
planets. So Moon will give the result while transiting Kethu star either in Simha
or Dhanus, whichever is earlier from today.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On July 20, 1969, Moon is transiting Kethu
star Magha in the sign Simha and therefore on this date you will borrow.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Always, he with whom one deals, whether he
takes or gives, is to be judged from the 7th house. When you borrow, he loses.
You receive a cheque means another has issued the cheque. If one is to give, it
is found from the 12th house to his lagna. Younger brother is shown by 3rd
house. The 12th to 3rd is 2nd. Therefore borrowing from younger brother is
indicated by the houses 2 and 6. If mother gives 3 and 6. If children give 4
and 6. If wife gives 6; if partner in business gives, 6th; if one with whom we deal
gives, then also 6th; if father gives 8 and 6. If elder brother gives 10 and 6.
If friend gives 10 and 6. This is how one is to note from whom one borrows.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In your case the sub lord of 6th cusp in
Moon, who is deposited in 8th bhava, Therefore you will borrow from your
father.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="11.1_Overdraft Facility.html">← 6 HOUSE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_11.2_Will I be able to borrow_ When and from whom">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="11.3_Will I be able to clear off loans_ When.html">Will I be able to clear off loans_ When →</a></div></body>
