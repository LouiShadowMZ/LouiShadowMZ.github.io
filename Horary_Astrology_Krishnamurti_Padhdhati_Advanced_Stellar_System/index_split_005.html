	<h2 id="id_Toc184334384" class="block_12">HINDUS —— UNSCIENTIFIC "KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI-SCIENTIFIC"</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Horary Astrology followed by the Hindus is not scientific. There are two methods:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(1) Ask for a number within 108 and divide by 12; take the remainder and counting from Aries
		depending on the reminder, we fix a sign as lagna. We take the whole sign as lagna bhava, the next sign is
		second bhava and so on. Hence the longitude of each bhava will be 30°. Only when the number given happens to be
		6 or 18 or 30 or 42 or 54 or 66 or 78 or 90 or 102, ascendant Virgo will rise for latitudes 14° to 18° N, the
		longitude of each house will be more or less the same, each being 30°. Otherwise, the longitude of each house
		must be different.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(2) We ask for number within 108 and divide it by 9 count from Aries, as many signs as the
		quotient is, then the remainder indicates the Navamsa in the next sign. So the number given by the consultant
		gives the navamsa, the longitude of which 3°20′. The house division is not suggested by the author in
		Uthrakalamridha. So, one is to take, naturally, 30°, 30° from that Navamsa or 15° behind and 15° in advance
		according to the Hindu system of house division. The author has not advocated as to which method is to be
		followed. But if we follow cusp to cusp, just like Westerners, then also we have to take 30°, as the longitude
		of each house. The longitude of each house will be 30° only when the number given is 47, and that also, will be
		nearing correctness only for 200 years to come as from 1st January, 1970, Ayanamsa is 23° 20′; one may refer to
		Raphael's Tables of Houses. Then one can find that, for latitudes 14° to 18° N when Libra 0 rises in the East,
		the other cusps are all in 0 in the next, next sign. (The sidereal time will be 6 hrs. 0 mts. 0 secs.) Therefore
		only for the latitudes 14 to 18° N, when according to Sayana 0 Libra rises in the East, the houses will be of
		30. Otherwise, the longitude of each must vary.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">But in Krishnamurti Padhdhati, the number indicates the sign, the star and the sub. And the sub
		commences at a particular position. This is taken as the ascendant and according to the latitude of the
		locality, where the horoscope is judged, taking into account the Ayanamsa on the day of judgment, the cusps of
		the other houses are calculated. Therefore, Krishnamurti Padhdhati is alone scientific, whereas the Hindu system
		is, in fact, unscientific.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Regarding Westerners they take the time of judgment; they crect the horoscope, for that time
		taking into account, the latitude of the place of judgment. So, it is very scientific. </p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334385" class="block_12">Number preferred</h3>
	<p class="block_4">But the defect in that system is that certain questions can never be answered using the horoscope
		erected for a particular moment of judgment. Suppose two people come and ask, within an interval of a few
		minutes. The horoscope, the aspects between the planets and the cusps of the houses, the mutual aspects among
		the planets themselves, will remain more or less the same, and therefore one has to predict the same result for
		both of them. (Time of event and the nature of the result). Supposing A and B stand for election in the same
		locality and both of them visit the house of an astrologer at an interval, of 5 minutes, the astrologer has to
		necessarily offer the same prediction to both of them.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">But if the astrologer were to ask for a number and accordingly he erects the horoscope, certainly
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(a) the position of the ascendant and the other cusps of the houses will vary, even though the
		planets may be in the same sign, same star, and same sub: </p>
	<p class="block_4">(b) the houses occupied by the planets will vary: </p>
	<p class="block_4">(c) the significators will vary and hence one can correctly predict the diametrically opposite
		results.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore, Krishnamurti Padhdhati-Horary Astrology- is most scientific and most useful for any
		question, and this gives precisely the correct answer and also the accurate date of fruition.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334386" class="block_12">Krishnamurti Padhdhati Replaces Traditional Astrology</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Astrology is a divine science. It has been practised by many astrologers, who followed either the
		traditional Hindu System or the Western System. Honestly both of them find it difficult to pinpoint the nature
		of the event and the time of event. The latter is more important to the consultants.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Time of event must be found out to the minute. Such a method alone is useful. With all humility,
		let me say that Lord Ganesh has given through me a particular technic to decide the event. It is popularly known
		as KRISHNAMURTI PADH- DHATI.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">All the creations of God must die either in the intrauterine life or born dead, or in the infancy
		or in the youth or in the old age. Death is a certainty: it is inevitable: at which time it comes, none knows.
		Pages after pages one may write, methods after methods, one can publish: symposium after symposium one can
		collect; but people with open mind will say that nothing serves useful purpose.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Let them follow K.P.; they will say after thoroughly understanding the subject, explained in a
		very simple way. applying strictly Krishnamurti's method as instructed by him, casting the horoscope using
		KRISHNAMURTI EPHEMERIS, KRISHNAMURTI AYANAMSA, and RAPHAEL'S TABLE OF HOUSES, and also the HORARY
		SYSTEM-KRISHNA-MURTI PADHDHATI-one can confirm the date and the time and declare the result which will prove to
		be correct.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">99% of the people get married. Which is important? To give the date of marriage; if fate is to
		suffer, then to give the date of divorce: if luck is there, to give the date of birth of children, etc. Is it
		not?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">A few percentage of the people alone own houses, so many have to live in rented buildings or in
		Government quarters, or in office accommodations. As most of them do not own, will they have any of their own at
		all; if so, when they can have, is to be clearly and correctly predicted.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Nowadays most of the students and those employed, desire to know whether they would get
		scholarship to go overseas, and persecute higher studies. Actually this question was not tackled by our
		ancients. K.P. alone is useful.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When the old scholars expounded the theory of Astrology, they were living in a land when Pakistan
		and India was one. They said that Capricorn represented India. They have not given separately which sign will
		represent Pakistan: therefore the difficulty arises for a student to know whether Capricorn indicates Pakistan
		or India. But if one follows the Horary System of Astrology-KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI-he need not pose such a
		problem. Horary answers.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus there are hundreds of problems for which we have to guess if we follow only the traditional
		system. But K. P. deals with each problem, gives most satisfactory and scientific explanation, calculating on
		simple and single method and it offers straight answer, solving the problem. K. P. can be followed by even a
		layman not knowing, previously, anything about astrology.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334387" class="block_12">ZODIAC</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Division of the Zodiac: The Zodiac is divided into twelve equal parts; each division is called a
		Solar mansion (or rasi, or sign.)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">They are Aries Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius. Capricorn,
		Aquarius and Pisces.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The Hindus have another division also. The Zodiac is divided into twenty-seven equal parts: each
		measures 13° 20' They commence from Aries 0° and end by Pisces 30. The 27 divisions are called Lunar Mansions
		(Nakshatras, Asterisms, Stars Constellations). They are called Aswini, Bharani. Karthikai, Rohini. ...
		Uthrapathrapada and Revathi,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The explanation that I can offer why they have taken 9 planets and divided the Zodiac into 27
		Nakshatras is as follows:-</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The Zodiac is 360° in longitude. What is the sanctity in the number 360. Probably, Sun moves in
		between the stars, in its path the Ecliptic-daily on an average, about of the circle. So, every day, in 24
		hours, Sun moves 1. Further, 360 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 10. 12, etc. when it will be easy
		for other calculations.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">It is first divided into 3 equal parts of 120° each. The four signs Aries. Taurus, Gemini and
		Cancer make up 120° The next four signs Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio form 120°, Sagittarius, Capricorn,
		Aquarius and Pisces are the last 4 signs measuring 120°. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">All planets moving from Vernal Equinox Aries-Mesha O according to Nirayana System-get their
		results modified as they move in the Zodiac. In the first 13° 20′. i.e., 0° to 13° 20′ any planet transitting in
		Mesha (Aries) will be influenced by Kethu, and the constellation is called Aswini. Then when it passes on,
		between 13° 20' and 26° 40', Venus influences it; this area is called Bharani. Between 26° 40' and 30° of Aries
		and from 0 Taurus to 10 Taurus, the planet's results will be modified by Sun, Karthikai is the name of the star,
		or constellation which I call as Zone. Then from 10 Taurus to 23° 20' Moon modifies the results of the planet
		occupying this Zone or Lunar Mansion called Rohini. Between 23° 20' in Taurus and 30 Taurus. as well as 0°
		Gemini to 6" 40′ in Gemini, the Zone or mansion called Mrigasirisha is ruled by Mars and the planet in this Zone
		will be under the control of Mars.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The next 13°20′, called Arudra, is governed by Rahu: next Punarvasu is ruled by Jupiter (Guru).
		It is followed by Pushya and Ashlesha governed by Saturn and Mercury respectively.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Similarly, from Simha 0 (Leo) upto the end of Scorpio, the four signs are divided into 9 lunar
		mansions (called Nakshatra, Stars or Constellations). They are called Makam, Poorvapalguni, Uthrapalguni,
		Hastham, Chithrai, Swathi, Visakam, Anuradha and Jyeshta which are ruled by 9 planets in the same order, viz.,
		Kethu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars (Sevvai, Mangal, Angaraka, Kuja). Rahu. Jupiter (Guru) Saturn (Sani), and Mercury
		(Budha).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The remaining 1/3 of the Zodiac contains the 4 signs Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces;
		and the nine constellations in it are Moolam, Poorvashada, Uthrashada, Sravana, Dhanishta, Sathabisha,
		Poorvapathrapada, Uthrapathrapada and Revathi. The planets Kethu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu. Jupiter, Saturn
		and Mercury rule the stars in the same. order.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence, planets in between 0 and 13°20' in Aries (Aswini), 0° and 13°20' in Leo (Makam), and 0°
		and 13°20' in Sagittarius (Moolam) will be under the sway of Kethu; 13°20' in Aries to 26°40' Bharani. 13°20' to
		26°40 (Leo) Poorvapalguni; 13°20' to 26°40′ in Sagittarius (Poorvashada), these three zones are ruled by Venus
		and planets transitting in these zones are under the influence of Venus and the results of Venus will be offered
		by the planet, transitting in this Zone.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus, each planet governs three zones in the Zodiac.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If a planet were to be in Aswini, another in Makam and the third in Moolam, all are under the
		influence of Kethu and in Kethu's zone. If the astrologer says that a planet is modified by the lord of the
		constellation Kethu, then the statement is not complete and clear. He has to add, whether it is in Aries, or
		Leo. or Sagittarius, otherwise one cannot locate the position of the planet correctly. That is why 27 different
		names are given to the 27 constellations.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">1. Aswini - Arietus - Stars 3<br class="calibre6" />2. Bharani - Arietisa Mus - 3<br

	<p class="block_4">25. Purvabhadra - Pegasi – 4<br class="calibre6" />26. Uttarabhadra - Pegasi and Andremedae –
		4<br class="calibre6" />27. Revathi - Pichum - 3<br class="calibre6" /> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore, these 27 stars are to guide us, so that we can calculate and ascertain the position of
		the 27 zones in the Zodiac, each measuring 13°20'.<br class="calibre6" /> </p>
	<p class="block_4">These 27 constellations are governed by the 9 planets. Hence, each planet rules over three zones
		at an interval of 120° (e.g.) KETHU-Aswini, Makam, Moolam, VENUS (Sukra) -Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam and so
		on.<br class="calibre6" /> </p>
	<p class="block_4">These zones modify the results of the planets transitting the Zodiac and not the stars, scattered
		in the Heavens which are far, far away. Planets are the immediate neighbours of our mother Earth and these
		belong to one family. Probably this is the reason why they have selected only 27 groups of stars even though
		there are numberless stars in the sky which can influence the earth as much as these 27 groups.<br
			class="calibre6" /> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Suppose (a) there is a light in the centre of a circular room provided with 12 glass panes of
		different colours, (b) around the room there is a verandah and outside it, there are 27 glass panes of which the
		colour 1, 10 and 19, is the same; 2, 11 and 20 differ from 1, 10, 19 but these three are of the same colour: 3,
		12 and 21 differ from others but these three are of the same colour as they belong to one group. Similarly, all
		the 27 panes are of 9 different colours<br class="calibre6" /> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If a person walks outside the circular verandah looking at the light inside, he will find the
		colour of the light getting changed according to the colour of the coloured panes. Similarly, the results of the
		planets are modified by the lord of the sign and indicated by the lord of the Nakshathra or constellation.<br
			class="calibre6" /> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If a planet is compared to a torch light, then the influence of the sign-Solar Mansion occupied
		by it and the influence of the Zones of 13°20' called stars, change the colour of the light. Suppose a railway
		guard shows the light. It may be plain, or green or red according to the background mirror.<br
			class="calibre6" /> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Similarly, imagine that the mirror used behind the bulb is the lord of the sign. It may be clear
		and it may illuminate to a maximum or it may be dull rendering the light, weak. The strength and modification of
		the colour depends on the mirror behind the bulb (which is the reflector) which denotes whether a planet is
		exalted and strong or debilitated and weak.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Also suppose one coloured slide is inserted between the torch light and the observer. This colour
		depends on the lord of the constellation when the planet is the bulb.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore, the results of a planet in different positions in the Zodiac, in different signs and
		different constellations is similar to the light from the torch getting modified and the resultant becoming
		absolutely different from the original light, unless all the colours are similar to that of the planet.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In my research I found that one should not satisfy himself with the modification of the lord of
		the constellation alone. But. one has to find out further sub-divisions, which should be: scientific, so that
		one can explain the differences between twin births.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So, I have divided each star in a manner which will be explained shortly. Suppose, we do not
		sub-divide, then we offer prediction taking into consideration the situation of a planet in a particular sign
		and star. It will be similar to saying that a particular dasa of a person will be brilliant. The dasa lord may
		be Venus. It will run for 20 years. Even though, in general, these 20 years might have proved to be beneficial,
		yet there would have been occasions when we could have had difficulties, trials and tribulations also, but these
		difficulties when compared to the beneficial results, may not be much. It may be similar to a person being
		foretold that he would gain in a race on a particular day. No doubt he may lose in the first race, lose in the
		second, gain in the third, again lose in the fourth and gain in the last few races. When we calculate, we may
		find that he had gained on that particular day. But consider his anxiety whenever he lost, especially in the
		first two races. It is similar to taking a planet, the sign and the star in which it was and passing judgment.
		But according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati" it will be possible to say that he will gain at a particular time and
		also conclude, that it is a day of profit. This method of forecast is not merely advantageous but correct and
		convincing as well.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Suppose a person is told that during Venus Dasa, he will be fortunate, no doubt, during Venus
		Dasa, Venus Bhukthi he gets married; Venus Dasa, Sun Bhukthi he starts business; Venus Dasa, Moon Bhukthi he
		goes overseas, Venus Dasa, Mars bhukthi he has a son. Venus Dasa Rahu Bhukthi some elder member in the family
		passes away: Venus Dasa Jupiter Bhukthi there is expansion in the business and he has another child. During
		Venus Dasa, Saturn Bhukti there is some labour trouble and minor losses. In Venus Dasa, Mercury Bhukti be opens
		branches, takes up agencies and during Venus Dasa Kethu Bhukthi he visits various pilgrim centres. On the whole,
		no doubt, the person got married, started business, went overseas, expanded business and stabilised it. Also one
		should not forget that he had lost a member of the family, had labour trouble, suffered some loss and had
		worries for some time. If a person is informed that in these 20 years, Venus will cause Rajayoga it will not
		help him much. But indeed, it would be useful only when he is informed both the time of event and also the
		nature of event, both good and bad. So, the dasa of 20 years is sub- divided into sub-periods otherwise called
		bhukti.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">On the same analogy, I established that the division of a constellation was necessary if correct
		results are to be forecast.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Suppose a person is informed that he will have very good business and profit on a particular day.
		He feels depressed till 2 p.m., as there was no business till then and in these hours he loses his faith in
		astrology: but the planets so adjust that a few marriage parties enter his shop and make purchases from him for
		an amount much greater than what he had been normally collecting daily. If the same astrologer could tell him
		that only between 2 and 4 pm, on that day he would do excellent business, it would have been advantageous for
		both. Then the method is scientific so the sub-divisions of the constellation are an imperative necessity to
		predict exact time of event.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Again, as a result of intensive research it has been possible to find out why a person receiving
		a few letters on a day in a particular moment, feels very happy when he goes through the contents of a letter,
		next feels dejected and depressed when he reads the other, gets irritated when he goes through the third and so
		on. It was found that the ascendant and the cusp of the houses move faster than the planets and it is the
		ascendant and the cusp of the houses which explain such rapid changes due to occupation of the star and sub.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The ascendant can move in a sign for about 2 hours; but in a constellation, it can only be for
		about 50 to 58 minutes. But certain events may happen within an interval of 10 or 15. minutes. Therefore, there
		should be some other minute factor which brings about varying results in a very short time. So, it was found
		that the ascendant in that constellation (star) showed that he would receive letters. But to indicate which
		moment he would read a pleasant letter, which moment he would read that letter which would irritate him and so
		on, further divisions of the constellation was necessary. This method was found in 1951 and it is convincing,
		and most scientific.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Let us take another example. Suppose, we judge the results according to the transit of the
		planets. It is generally stated that Saturn while transiting the 11th house will produce most desirable results.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Saturn will be passing through the 11th house, roughly for a period of two and a half years.
		Saturn signifies certain matters to the person according to his chart and only such of those matters alone will
		be expected by him. It is not uncommon (1) that for a long time after the entry of Saturn into the 11th house,
		the person continues to suffer and is not able to reconcile, (2) some actually suffer all the time whereas they
		enjoy when Saturn transits in the 12th sign. When Saturn is in 11, what actually one will enjoy, or experience
		depends on the lord of the constellation and the lord of the sub, according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati and this
		would explain why the Traditional system fails miserably.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">First of all, I would like to say emphatically that all persons having Saturn in 11 can never
		expect favourable results because the ascendant may be different and the lords of the constellations in the 11th
		house may be ruling evil houses to that lagna-born. Thereby the person will and must experience difficulties
		through the source indicated by Saturn (the transiting planet), But, according to my technique, when Saturn is
		passing in a constellation, throughout that period, he neither enjoys nor suffers uniformly, but during certain
		periods he finds beneficial results compensating for the difficulties. The method which I advocate is very
		correct and it will never fail: because, take the sub-division of the constellation. The constellation indicates
		the matters signified by its lords: the planet transiting influence such results denoted by the lord of the star
		through the source denoted by the transiting planet (by nature, lordship and occupation etc.) and it is the
		sub-lord which decides whether the result is favourable or unfavourable. The lord of the constellation is
		similar to the lord of a dasa of the Vimshothari system, whereas the sub is the lord of the sub- period or
		Bhukti. So, I have evolved a method to divide the constellation based upon the sound principles of astrology,
		which will appeal to one and all.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Suppose, Moon enters a particular constellation, say Bharani (the second star of the 27 stars),
		the longitude of which extends from 13°20′ to 26°40′ of Aries (Mesha) and a child is born at that moment. What
		do we say? Is it not that the child is to run Venus Dasa and it will have 20 years of Venus Dasa left over at
		the time of the birth? The child is having Venus Dasa, Venus Bhukti at the time of the birth. If Moon moves a
		little further, say 1° (ie. 14°20' in Aries-Mesha), we say that the child has a balance of 18 years 6 months and
		also that the child will have Venus Dasa. Venus Bhukti at the time of the birth. But, when Moon has moved 20/120
		of Bharani and a child is born then, we say that the child has a balance of 16 years 8 months and that the child
		is having Venus Dasa, Sun Bhukti, just starting. If Moon further moves by 6/120 of the star, and a child is
		born, we say that the child commences with Moon Bhukti. If further Moon moves by 10/120 of the star, we say the
		child will be having Venus Dasa, Mars Bhukti Moon moves further by 7/120 of Bharani. So, Mars sub is also over:
		Rahu sub starts. Let it go on. When it completes 18/120 of this star, Rahu sub is over and Jupiter starts. Thus,
		it will be seen that the Moon is influenced by the exact position which it occupies in the constellation.
		Therefore, Moon in the beginning is under the sway of Venus and the sub of Venus. Then, Moon is in the
		constellation of Venus and the sub of Sun. Next it passed in the same constellation belonging to Venus but in
		the sub of Moon. It is followed by the sub of Mars, then by Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, and lastly by Kethu.
		So according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati each constellation is sub-divided into 9 parts. They are not equal in the
		longitude but the longitude of each sub is in the proportion in which they are allotted the total number of
		years in Vimshothari Dasa system.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The longitude of each constellation is 13°20' equal to 800 minutes. Therefore, in every
		constellation of 800 minutes each planet will have an area equal to the number of years allotted to each in the
		dasa multiplied by 6 and 2/3 minutes. Therefore, Sun's sub extends to 40 minutes whatever be the constellation.
		Mars and Kethu extend for 46-2/3 minutes, Moon extends for 1° 6-2/3, Rahu extends for exactly 2. Jupiter has an
		area of 1° 46' 40" Mercury 1°53' 20": Saturn 2° 13' 20".</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Even though the area allotted to each planet is the same in cach star, yet the order in which
		they occupy the constellation differs. To note the order, one has to find out which planet rules the
		constellation, then the beginning of the constellation is ruled by the lord of the star, just like in any dasa,
		the first sub- period or bhukti is ruled by the dasa lord. The second sub is ruled by the bhukti lord who will
		follow the dasa lord. Then in the same cyclic order the subs will be ruled as in the bhuktis</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In Aswini, the first sub is allotted to Kethu, the second to Venus, the third to Sun, the fourth
		to Moon and so on till the last sub is given to Mercury. Aswini is ruled by Kethu. So the first sub is allotted
		to Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If the star is Rohini, note the lord of the star. It is Moon. Hence, allot the first sub to Moon.
		In the cyclic order, who will follow Moon? It is Mars. So the second sub is given to Mars, the third to Rahu,
		the fourth to Jupiter and so on till the last sub is governed by Sun.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If the star is Punarpushyam, otherwise called Punarvasu, the first subdivision is governed by
		Jupiter, next by Saturn and the last by Rahu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If the star is Pushya, the lord is Saturn. Therefore the first sub is governed by Saturn, the
		second sub is ruled by Mercury, the third is allotted to Kethu and so on till the last sub is under the sway of
		Jupiter.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If the star is Aslesha, otherwise called Ayilyam, the first sub-division is governed by Mercury,
		the next by Kethu and so on, till the last sub-division is allotted to Saturn..</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus all the twenty-seven stars are divided among the nine planets. It may appear as though the
		whole Zodiac is divided into 27 multiplied by 9 parts. Actually, the lord of the sign, the lord of the star and
		the lord of the sub will be 249 instead of 243. If one can refer to the table, it is easy for one to know how
		the stars 27 in number even though each is divided into 9 divisions, totalling to 243 divisions, yet due to the
		change in the sign lord (lord of the sign), as certain subs are found in 2 adjacent signs, they are 249 in
		number. (Furthermore one can sub-divide and record the results.)</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334388" class="block_12">CONSTELLATION AND SUB</h3>
	<p class="block_4">The zodiac is divided into 27 equal parts. Each is called an asterism, Nakshathra, star or
		constellation. They are equal in: longitude. Each constellation is 13°20′ or 800′. It commences from Mesha Aries
		0° which is ever 180° opposite to Spica Star and the 27 stars ruled by Kethu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu,
		Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury in the above order make up the Zodiac of 360°. After these 9 planets in the above
		order extend from Aries 0° to Cancer 30°, again they, in the same order extend from Leo 0° to Scorpio 30°; again
		they follow the same order Kethu to Mercury from Sagittarius 0° to Pisces 30°. Thus Kethu has 3 zones. Next to
		the zone of Kethu, Venus has 3 zones; next to Venus, Sun rules 3 stars. Next to Sun, Moon governs 3 stars. Thus
		each planet rules 3 stars.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore</p>
	<p class="block_4">Kethu rules Aswini, Maka and Moola (1-10-19)</p>
	<p class="block_4">Venus rules Bharani, P. Palguni and Poorvashada (2-11-20)</p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun rules Karthik, U. Palguni and Uthrashada (3, 12, 21)</p>
	<p class="block_4">Moon rules Rohini, Hastha and Sravana (4, 13, 22) </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mars rules Mrigasira, Chitra and Dhanishta (5, 14, 23)</p>
	<p class="block_4">Rahu rules Arudhra, Swathi and Sathabisha (6, 15, 24)</p>
	<p class="block_4">Jupiter rules P. Vasu, Visaka, P. P. Pada (7, 16, 25)</p>
	<p class="block_4">Saturn rules Pushya, Anuradha, U.P. Pada. (8, 17, 26)</p>
	<p class="block_4">Mercury rules Ashlesha, Jyeshta, Revathi. (9, 18, 27)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Since the Zodiac is of 360 and it is equally, divided into 12 signs, each extending to
		30°exactly, in each sign there will be, on the whole 2-1/4 constellation,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In Arics, Aswini, Bharani and 3°20′ of Karthik, in Taurus, Karthik remaining 10°, Rohini and
		Mrigasira 6° 40′ in Gemini Mrigasira remaining 6° 40′ Arudhra and P. Vasu 10°.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In Cancer remaining 3°20′ P. Vasu, Pushya and Ashlesha. Thus in Leo Maka, P. P. Guni and 1/4 of
		U.P. Guni: in Virgo 3/4, U.P. Guni, Hastha, Chitra 1/2; in Libra Chitra 1/2, Swathi Visaka 3/4 in Scorpio Visaka
		1/4 Anuradha and Jyeshta. In Sagittarius Moola, P. Shada and U. Shada first 14; in Capricorn remaining 3/4: U.
		Shada. Sravana. Dhanishta 1/2: In Aquarius remaining 1/2 Dhanishta, Sathabisha P.P. Pada 3/4. In Pisces. P.P.
		Pada remaining 1/4, U. Pada and Revathi.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The sign is not as important as the constellation. The sub is more important. The sign gives an
		idea about the strength of the planet. Planet occupying a house is stronger than the owner of the sign. Tenant
		is stronger than the owner. Here there are two mansions. One is the sign, i.e., one of the twelve equal
		divisions of the zodiac. The other is the equal divisions of the zodiac into 27 equal parts which is 13 degrees
		20 minutes cach, called constellation. Therefore, the tenant in a sign is stronger than the lord of the sign and
		the tenant in a constellation is stronger than the lord of the constellation.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence a planet in a sign will give to a greater extent the results of the house in which its
		position is. The planet in a constellation will offer the results of the Bhava-house occupied by the lord of the
		constellation.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">All planets must be in a house and also in any constellation. Constellation is stronger than the
		sign.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence the planet which is situated in the constellation is the strongest to offer the results of
		the house occupied by the lord of the constellation.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Then the occupant of a house is strong to give the results of the house occupied by it.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Next comes the planet deposited in the constellation of the lord of the sign were the cusp of a
		house falls.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Then only the lord of the sign where the cusp of a house falls. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Planets which are conjoined with or aspected by these significators ascertained by the above
		analysis also are to offer the results of the houses indicated by the significators. Thus one is to find out the
		role of sign, and star.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">This is the finding after any years of research. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>

	<p class="block_4">Jupiter Dasa 3 years 1 month 6 days.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">This gentleman had gains, fortune and success during Saturn, Mars and Sun sub periods; desirable
		benefits during Jupiter and Mercury sub periods. But Kethu in 10. Venus in 11 and Rahu in 4 gave untoward and
		undesirable results.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to traditional system, Saturn and Sun must be the worst. Jupiter also will fall in 12th
		Bhava and ought to have been very bad. Venus and Budha causing Dharma Karmadhipathi Rajayoga should give
		brilliant results. Rahu representing Venus must cause Rajayoga. Mars should be dangerous. This person was my
		friend for a long number of years and such results alone opened my eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In 1939, when I visited Coimbatore, I heard one Nadi reader reading the results of a few persons
		in his cottage. I understood that planets' results were read as they were found in the Bhavas. Then I heard many
		Nadi readers. None made use of the constellation. While reading the Nadi, I understood that without assigning
		the reason, the results were read and they were astoundingly meticulously correct. For the future they gave the
		reasons taking the traditional methods of the Bhavas and the future proved to be mostly a failure. So, I started
		the research collecting the horoscopes of old people with past events.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Such horoscopes as shown above threw the light. What is it? A planet ‘A’ offers the results of
		the house occupied by the lord of the star ‘B’ wherein this planet ‘A’ is deposited,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Again trouble arose when 2, 3 or 4 planets were found in the same constellation, as all the
		planets in the same star, though referring the same matters, yet gave diametrically opposite results, i.e., if
		planets A, B, C and D are in one constellation, in the same house. A and C gave pleasant results whereas B and D
		gave just opposite results. This made me think further. I found that a particular dasa is to cause Rajayoga. But
		yet, he gets most desirable results in some Bukties and irrepairable disadvantageous results in some Bhukties,
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Then I started doing research and in all cases I found that planets, though they are in the same
		constellation, yet a few of them alone can be beneficial and a few must be unfavourable. This caused me to
		further carry on the research. I found that every constellation must be divided in the manner, I have said, into
		9 subs and each sub having that area in a constellation in the proportion in which they are allotted the number
		of years in Vimsodhari Dasa.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">I proved that planets occupying any one constellation has connection with the bhava occupied by
		the lord of the constellation. These planets in that constellation are termed as the "Significators" of the
		Bhava occupied by the lord of the constellation. Thus if one works out, for all the planets, then each planet is
		found to signify the matters of a few houses.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Then judge each planet. The planet signifies a matter. Whether it votes for the progress and
		prosperity of that matter depends on the sub lord: it is not capable of doing good, but, it does harm to that
		bhava signified by the planet, if the sub lord is detrimental to that house matters</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">This discovery has crowned me with success.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">I say, "If a planet is the significator of lagna bhava, it gives long life, success in attempts,
		it helps to maintain good health, if the sub lord is not also the significator of 6 or 8 or 12. If the sub-lord
		of the planet signifies 6th house if the planet signifying lagna results by occupying the constellation of a
		planet in Lagna Bhava occupies such a sub ruled by the significator of 6, he falls ill. The constellation refers
		his health, sub signifying 6 gives disease. If a planet signifies lagna bhava and it is in the sub of the
		significator of 8 he meets with danger.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord signifies 12th house and the significator of lagna is in such a sub, one runs
		away, or imprisoned, or hospitalised.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore constellation lord shows whom or which matter it refers. But the deciding factor, good
		or bad, success or failure is shown by the sub occupied by the significator.</p>
	<p class="block_21">﻿</p>
	<p class="block_4">Suppose a planet A is the significator of second bhava and it is in the sub of 6 one borrows but
		if it is in the sub of 8 or 12, he lends or repays loan. Second shows finance. Do you receive a cheque or issue
		a cheque is shown by the sub-lord.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If it is in the sub of 11, there is gain of what? Either money or son-in-law or daughter-in-law
		or child birth to the person. Because 2nd house shows family, 11th indicates the above relations. If the
		significator of the second house is in the sub of the significator of 3, through brother one gains, brother
		loses or gives away: if it is in the sub of 4, one may have car. or house during the period of the significator
		of 2nd house deposited in the sub of 4th house significator, in their conjoined periods. If the significator of
		the 4th house rules the sub and if it is also the significator or 11, he purchases and acquires: if the sub-lord
		who is also the significator of 12 other than 4, he sells and converts the permanent possession as liquid cash
		and his bank position improves by losing the car or building. If the sub-lord of planet signifying second house
		is the significator of 10 and 12, then he lets his land for tenancy or lets the house for rent. Why? 10th house
		is the 4th to the 7th which whom you transact: So, that which he takes, is given by you (12) and he is indebted
		(6). 10th being 4 to 7, 10 denotes other's possession and it is your business.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Suppose a planet is the significator of 7th house and if it is in the sub of 2 or 11 one gains,
		there is reunion, one gets married, etc. If it is in the sub of the significator of 12, separation or ill-health
		to wife. If it is in the sub of 1 and 2, danger to partner's life. There can be 3 or 4 or any number of
		significators for the 7th. Therefore, during the period or sub- period of a planet in such a sub whose lord
		signifies 12th house, wife falls ill or the native goes away and separation is caused. If the sub-lord signifies
		6th house, the wife goes away, thereby there is separation.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If the planet is the significator of 7th house and sub of 4, partner gains, makes money, and
		earns name. If the significator of 7 is in the sub of 5, partner makes money, friendship and enjoys pleasure. If
		the sub is ruled by the significator of 8th house, there is either income or danger to life. If that
		significator of 8th house is also significator of 5, partner gains. But significator of 8 is also significator
		of 1 and 7, it means death to partner as 8 and 1 are maraka houses to the 7th.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus one should note separately what each planet signifies. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Then in which sub each planet is posited.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Finally one should take each house and judge to which bhavas the planets are the significators
		and the sub-lords. Judge calmly how cach bhava is receiving good results from a few and adverse from the rest.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Say, mother, father, child, etc. Mother is shown by 4th house: father by 9th house: child by 5th
		house.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So, note the significators of 4: so also the significators of 9 and 5.</p>

		even when they are there, Secretary can do other than what the Deputys do.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">There is no planet is Sun's star. Hence Sun gives lagna results. Sun is in Moon's star. Moon is
		in 9 and owns 12. Hence Sun mostly refers to the matters signified by 9 and 12, ie, long journey: staying
		outside; loss of father; permanent possession of father, separation from father. Let us judge the death of his
		father.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Note the sub occupied by Sun. It is in Jupiter's sub. What can Jupiter do to the 9th house? What
		can Jupiter do to the 12th house!</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Jupiter is in Saturn star. As Saturn is the Bhadhakasthana Adhipathi to 9, Jupiter indicates
		Bhadhaka to father. Therefore, if a constellation indicates father, then the sub of Jupiter in that
		constellation indicates danger to the father.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore Sun in the constellation of Moon in 9 and sub of Jupiter —— the Bhadhaka to father,
		promises danger to father.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">9th house is owned by Mars. It governs Mrigasira, Chitra and Dhanishta stars. Rahu and Mercury
		are in Mars star. Rahu is in the sub of Mars who denotes longevity to father. Mercury is in the sub of Saturn,
		Bhadhaka to father. Hence Rahu is a benefic whereas Mercury is evil.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To the longevity of father houses 2 and 3 counted from 9th is evil. Both are owned by Venus. Rahu
		occupies 2 to 9: Mars occupies Venus star; none in Rahu star. Mars is in the sub of Venus. So it is harmful;
		Rahu is in the sub of Mars. It is good.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore Sun, Mercury and Mars are evil. Venus is in Jupi- ter sub. Venus is also evil. (Venus
		is in the constellation of Kethu who represents 4th and 9th houses. Therefore Venus indicates the houses 9, 10
		and 3 danger to father.)</p>

	<h2 id="id_Toc184334389" class="block_12">ERECTION OF HORARY HOROSCOPE</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Books Needed: (1) Raphael's Table of houses and either (2) Krishnamurti Ephemeris or Raphael's
		Ephemeris for the year when the chart is to be erected. (3) The Table showing the commencement of the sub
		according to the number given by the consultant. (4) Correct time when the astrologer begins to judge.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The time to be taken for Horary Chart: Whether one has the horoscope or not, whenever there is an
		immediate problem, one would like to know or confirm by horary astrology also. So, one may visit the
		Astrologer's place and the astrologer may also start attending to one's problem, or one may send it by post or
		send a messenger to consult or ask by phone. Now, the doubt arises whether one has to take the time when a
		person begins to write a letter to the astrologer; or when he posts it in his locality; or when the astrologer
		receives it from the postman: or when the astrologer begins to judge. We must take only the time of judgment.
		The time at which the urge comes in mind of the constulant may be compared to the urge of a expectant mother
		needing a midwife's assistance. Posting the letter is similar to getting a conveyance to go to the nursing home.
		Postman delivering the letter is similar to the expectant mother getting admitted into the labour ward. But the
		moment when the astrologer sits for judgment is similar to the moment the whole body of the child has got
		separated from that of the mother. If one were to erect a horoscope for the moment when the urge was in the mind
		of the consultant, it will show whether the astrologer would answer at all or not: whether the astrologer would
		take long time to give the reply; and also whether the letter was mis-carried or delivered properly to the
		astrologer. For the time when the postman delivers the letter if the horoscope is cast, it will show when the
		astrologer will take it for judgment. But if one takes the time when the astrologer erects a horoscope for the
		moment of the judgment, then the planets I will be occupying such a position which gives a clear picture to the
		astrologer. The truth will dawn in his mind. Therefore, the time of judgment alone must be taken to give the
		results for the query put by the consultant and the number which he had written should remain the same.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Accordingly, for the past 18 years, work had been done and uniformly everywhere the results had
		come very true. The results had proved to be marvellous and very helpful to the customer. Therefore, readers
		must take only the time of judgment whatever may be the time of query by the consultant.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Take Standard time: Every nation has got its own standard time, and for the erection of the
		horoscope, one need not convert the time of judgment, noted in standard time to local meantime and then refer to
		Sidereal time and so on. Because, Horary Astrology, according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, depends on the number
		given by the consultant and every number refers to a particular sign, star and sub as the Ascendant. One has to
		take only the commencing position of the sub, as Ascendant. Therefore, there is no necessity to convert the
		standard time to local meantime and then by noting down the sidereal time, to arrive at the sidereal time at the
		moment of judgment. Because, we are not erecting a map with the 12 cusps for the moment of judgment. It is the
		number which we take and each number has got a definite position in the Nirayana Zodiac. Having this as
		Ascendant, one is to calculate the other 11 cusps for the latitude of the place of judgment.</p>

	<p class="block_4">Table showing the number, the sign-lord, the star-lord, the sub-lord the commencing and ending
		position of each sub.</p>

	<p class="block_4">(D stands for degrees, M for minutes and S for seconds.) </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_21">﻿……</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Example 1.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Calculation: Suppose a consultant gives a number, say, 48 within 1 and 249, referring to the
		Table of Krishnamurti Padhdhati, one can find, that number 48 refers to Mercury sign, Rahu star, Jupiter sub,
		which commences at 8° 40′ in Gemini-Mithuna.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Since Krishnamurti Padhdhati is the advanced stellar astrology, the zodiac is NIRAYANA one. But
		for finding out the position of the cusps of the houses, we refer to Raphael's Table of Houses, which is in
		Sayana system. Therefore, it is necessary to add the Ayanamsa of that date of judgment to the position of the
		Ascendant, arrived at for the number given by the consultant.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Here, the consultant has given number 48. It means, the beginning of the sub of the ascendant is
		in Gemini in 8° 40'. Today, being 11th December, 1969, and the Ayanamsa is 23°20', we have to add 8° 40' in
		Gemini and 23° 20' and we get 32°. It means, the second degree in Cancer will be the Sayana Ascendant. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The question is judged at Madras. One is to take the latitude of the place where the astrologer
		judges the horoscope even though the consultant would have written from any part of the world. Therefore, the
		latitude of 13° 04'N latitude for Madras is to be taken up.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4"><span class="calibre3">Referring to Table of Houses, we find that the position of the cusps are
			given for 13° or 14°. Since 13° 04' is nearer to 13, we can refer to the Table of Houses given for 13°
			latitude. In that Table we have to find out where 2° Ascendant in Cancer is given. So, we will find that he
			has given, for 1° 54'in Cancer, and 2° 45' in Cancer. But we should find out the cusps of other houses if 2°
			Cancer is to be the Ascendant. So, work out proportionately.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Then, we will get that 28° 7′ in Cancer is the second cusp: 25° 7' in Leo will be the third cusp;
		26° 7' in Pisces will be the tenth cusp: 297 in Aries will be the eleventh cusp: 27 in Gemini will be the 12th
		cusp.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">All these are in Sayana position. We have to convert them to Nirayana. Therefore, deduct 23° 20′.
		Then 8° 40′ in Gemini will be the Ascendant. 4° 47′ in Cancer will be the 2nd cusp: 1° 47' in Leo will be the
		3rd cusp: 2° 47′ in Pisces will be the 10th; 5° 47' in Aries will be the 11th; 8° 47′ in Taurus will be the 12th
		cusp.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">We have to add 180° to all these 6 cusps, so that 180° added to the ascendant gives the position
		of the 7th cusp. 180° added to the second cusp gives the position of the 8th cusp; 180° added to the 3rd cusp
		gives the position of the 9th cusp : similarly 180° added to the meridian (10th cusp) will give the cusp of the
		fourth. 180° added to the 11th cusp will give the position of the 5th cusp; 180° added to the 12th cusp will
		give the position of the 6th cusp.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore, the map showing the 12 cusps, will be as follows:</p>

		as possible, avoid calculations when ready reference Table is available. So refer to Raphael's Table and when

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"Sir, the table of houses is in Sayana position. Is it not?"</p>

	<p class="block_4">Which ayanamsa am I to follow?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Follow Krishnamurti Ayanamsa alone. Forget all others. When Krishnamurti Ayanamsa is used and by
		using the sub- division of a constellation you come correct in minute details, it goes without saying that the
		other ayanamsas are not to be followed, especially if it varies by degrees? Follow only mine.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">What is the Ayanamsa now?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">23 degrees 20 minutes. So you add this figure to the nirayana position you got for the number you
		gave, i.c. 74. Hence add 23° 20′ to 14° 53′ 20". Then the Sayana position of the lagna would be 8° 13' 20". Turn
		over the page where the cusps of various houses are given for Delhi latitude. Then you will get that Virgo 9°
		32′ is the second cusp; Libra 8° 32′ is the third cusp; fourth will be 10° 32′ Scorpio; fifth will be 13° 32′
		Sagittarius; sixth will be 15° 32′ Capricorn and the other 6 cusps are 180 degrees opposite to these.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now we have got the Sayana position of the 12 cusps. Deduct the Ayanamsa and convert them to

		planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">For which time are we to note the position of the planets? If you judge a chart immediately after
		calculation, then you have to note the position of the planets at which you started casting of the horoscope for
		judgment. Cusps for each number can be done and kept as a ready reckoner. You may keep a ready reckoner for any
		single locality for every number between 1 and 249 if you ever stay there. One may note the position of the
		planets and in continuation judge. That time alone should be taken for the position of the planets.</p>

	<p class="block_4">It is only to find the cusps of the houses one is to find out the time in L.M.T. But to calculate

		Raphael Ephemeris are for 12 noon Greenwich. That is why I have given in my Ephemeris the position of the
		planets for 5-30 P.M. 1.S.T. I could have given the position of the planets for 12 noon 1.S.T. But you cannot
		verify easily with that of Western Ephemeris and confirm that mine gives exactly the same position and is
		correct. So one can work with confidence. Doubt should never be there. Therefore you calculate and insert in the
		map after deducting ayanamsa from the figures obtained. Then the following is the horoscope for judgment:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mercury Dasa at the moment of judgment balance 5 years 11 months 20 days. We have to presume that
		Mercury Dasa Rahu Bhukti started on 30-1-68.</p>

	<h3 id="id_Toc184334391" class="block_12">Author's Progress in Research and Success:</h3>
	<p class="block_4">Research was made upon such matters which could be verified shortly either on the same day or in
		a few days or in a few months. Then only, one can, in his lifetime complete the research and come out
		successful. The following will explain:-</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">1. The electric light was off. "When we can have it?" I posed this question and asked somebody to
		give a number: erected a horoscope immediately and I took the ruling planets as well as the sign lord, the
		star-lord and sub-lord of the Ascendant. I waited till the light came and then worked out the ascendant and with
		cusp (for the moment when the light came for that latitude and longitude of the place). I noted the lord of the
		sub. rising in the East, Le., the Ascendant and that of 11th cusp. Thus, I carried on and found out that both
		the ruling planets as well as the planets sign-lord, star-lord and sub-lord who govern the position, indicated
		by the number, and 11th cusp gave the clue to arrive at the moment correctly.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">2. When I was in service, the accountant used to send a peon to the treasury to get the money.
		The peon had to return the same day itself. He might return by 12 noon or any time. within 5 P.M. I used to ask
		the accountant to give a number to find out when the orderly would return. I worked out the ascendant for that
		particular moment; noted down the ruling planets at the moment of judgment and waited till the peon returned.
		Calculated the lords of the ascendant which I had, according to the number given by the accountant, and noted
		the planets which would govern the sign, star and the sub at the moment of the arrival of the orderly.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">3. My daughter who was working in a concern, used to return at any time between 5-30 and 6-30
		P.M. To carry out my research, I used to ask my wife to give a number within 249. Noted down the ruling planets
		at the moment of judgment and also the lord of the sign, star and sub for the number given by my wife; noted
		down the lord of the sign, the lord of the star and the lord of the sub of the eleventh cusp. I found full
		agreement and the prediction proved to be correct to the minute.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">There used to be strikes in offices, and the management used to give a number to find out when it
		would be called off especially in Calcutta. I erected a chart for the moment of the judgment, taking the
		ascendant according to the number given by the manager, and since his desire was to call off the strike, I took
		the eleventh cusp and noted down the lord of the sub. I passed my own judgment and waited to see when it was
		actually called off. Since the prediction came very true, I began to improve the method. Even the strike in
		Simpson's group was predicted by my son correct to the hour. I do not call him a genius. All will consider him
		as a scientific and able Astrologer. The agent of Bank of India, Mylapore Branch who was present at that time
		phoned to me saying that the prediction was marvellous, as none can even guess when it would be called off.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Again, opportunities arose when I used to book trunkcalls, to various places in India and the
		moment I book, immediately I used to ask a student of mine sitting with me, to give a number within 249 and
		worked out. I took the houses 3, 9 and 11 to know when it would materialise. It has been found by me that
		whenever the sub-lord of the third cusp was deposited in the constellation of a planet in retrograde motion, in
		a few minutes, the telephone office will call me and say that the line is out of order and I cancelled the call.
		But if the sub-lord himself was retrograde and the lord of the constellation direct, then I did not cancel the
		call, it matured later. If the sub-lord of the 9th cusp was in the constellation of a retrograde planet, I used
		to get the reply that the party with whom I wanted to speak, was absent and I cancelled. But if the sub-lord
		himself was retrograde his relatives at home asked the Telephone Department to keep the call pending, sent word
		to the party and later gave connection. If the sub-lord of the 11th cusp was situated in the constellation of a
		planet in retrograde motion. Then even though they gave connection, neither I was able to hear him nor could he
		hear me due to much of disturbance, and it was a waste. If the sub-lord himself was retrograde, the staff in
		Telephone Department was complained about the defect which they set right and we had the talk.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun and Moon ever direct, never retrograde. Rahu and Kethu move in opposite direction; they never
		retrace; their pathway and movement are steady in its own direction; hence treat Rahu and Kethu as never
		retrograde. The other planets alone can be either direct or retrograde. This is applicable to Krishnamurti
		Padhdhati.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus I used to pose such questions, erect the horoscopes for the moment at which the matter was
		given, allow the time to pass and noted down the time when exactly the matter materialised. Calculated and found
		out the ascendant rising then and also the cusp of houses signifying the matter, gave correct indication.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus, on minor events research was done on hundreds and hundreds of occasions, and WHEN EVERY
		QUESTION HAD COME VERY CORRECT, it gave the mental strength to proceed further and apply to major problems. In
		Astrology, whether the problem is a minor one or a major one, the principle remains the same. Using one's
		commonsense one should proceed scientifically.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">This is the way how I started research on Horary Astrology after deciding that I should take the
		number between 1 and 249.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whenever there was none to mention a number and the question pertained to me, I used to open a
		book of 400 pages and then see the number of the page printed on the right side of the book. I worked out for
		that number; erected a horoscope; posed myself some question and read out the results. This worked out very
		satisfactory. If, by chance, the number of the page which I noted down was above 249, the matter which I thought
		of, never materialised. Decision of God is known at once. I never divided by 249.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">For example, (1) I want to meet a friend of mine. To find out whether he is in the headquarters,
		so that I could meet him, for some favour. I used to open a book and whenever the number was above 249, I found
		either he had gone overseas or he was in Delhi to attend some conference.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(2) On occasions when I tried for reservation of a berth, on a particular date, and when such a
		number beyond 249 was noted, in spite of all my influence, it was impossible to reserve one berth. Thus in
		matters where it could be immediately verified, I found that if anybody were to give a number beyond 249; then
		one can immediately say that the consultant cannot have his desire fulfilled without taking further pains for
		calculation, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Again, to find out the method whether it is the right side or left side of one's body is
		affected, right leg or left leg fractured: right hand or left hand amputated, etc., I used to put two drops of
		honey on the floor and I used to observe the flies tasting the honey. I used to open a book, note the number. I
		found sub-lord of the 6th gave clue. The fly which was either on the right or the left, first flew away, 7th
		house shows flies; They, to fly away means 12 to 7. i.e., 6th house. When I came very correct, I began to find
		out which side of the body of a person (whether the right side or left side) is affected. I noted the number
		from a book and took 6th house indicating defect to the consultant. I did experiment on the numbers given by the
		persons also when I took 12th cusp. Since honest attempts were made by me, I used to ask my friend to sit along
		with me and face the same direction, observing the flies. I used to predict in advance and on all occasions I
		came correct. But if I would have been otherwise like a very few (which is not to be ruled out) then I would
		have asked the friend to sit on the opposite side, facing me. Without any working, I could say that the fly in
		the left will leave first. If that which flew away is left to me I will tell him "See, I am correct." And if
		that fly which is on the right to me, goes away first, I will tell him, "You see, I am correct", you are the
		consultant; you have to observe that which was in the left to you, had gone away, first. Thus the dishonest
		person can twist, but Krishnamurti Padhdhati is only for one answer and there is no room to twist. The answer is
		invariably correct, whatever be in the mind of the consultant. If I said that which was on his left would fly,
		even if he had in his mind the right one KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI never failed.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">One of the greatest achievements is the success in finding out that the Ruling planets reveal the
		truth and guides one to correctly predict. This truth was never expounded by Hindu sages or Western savants.</p>
