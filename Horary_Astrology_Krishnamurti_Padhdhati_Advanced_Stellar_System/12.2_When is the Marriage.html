<body><h2 id="heading_12.2_When is the Marriage_0"><span lang="EN-US">When is the Marriage</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Sir, your students say that
predictions based on the horoscope of a person may or may not be correct. All
the position of the 12 cusps depend on the moment of the birth time
taken.  And you decide whether there is fulfilment of one's desire or not
only from the sub lord of the cusps to be taken for judgment. Hence, it seems
you prefer Horary to Natal chart."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes, undoubtedly. I reiterate that
Horary is the best to get correct and amazing results."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"For Horary am I to give a number?
"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes, please mention any number
between 1 and 249. "</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Let me give 74."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose I give number 74 within 1 and 249
and the query is judged at Delhi at 7-30 A.M. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By 74 it is meant that Moon sign Cancer,
Saturn star Pushya and 14</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 53' 20" ruled by
Jupiter is the lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Then we have to find out the cusps of
the other houses." </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Will not the cusps vary from one
place to the other?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"All places in the same latitude will
have the same cusps even though their longitude may be different. Therefore one
is to note the latitude of the place of judgment and not the place from which
the query is put."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"So, we have to take the latitude of
Delhi."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes. It is for Delhi we have to see.
The latitude is 28-38 North. "</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which Table of Houses do you recommend to
refer ?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Till the Table of HOUSES prepared by me
comes out, one should refer only the Raphael's Table of Houses and not anything
else: we should avoid calculations. Even he who claims that he is good in
Higher Mathematics failed in Elementary Mathematics which I pointed out in my
October 1967 issue. One may be M.A. yet he can err. Therefore as far as
possible avoid calculations when ready reference table is there. So refer to
Raphael's Table and when mine is released refer to mine."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">“<span lang="EN-US">Sir, the Table of Houses is in Sayana
position. Is it not?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes. So you have to note the ayanamsa
on the day of judgment.</span>“</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which Ayanamsa am I to follow?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Follow Krishnamurti Ayanamsa. Forget all
others. When Krishnamurti Ayanamsa is used and by using the subdivision of a
constellation you come correct in minute details, it goes without saying that
the other ayanamsa are not to be followed, especially if it varies by degrees?
Follow only mine.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What is the Ayanamsa now?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">23 degrees 20 minutes. So you add this
figure to the position you got for the number you gave, i.e. 74. Hence add
23-20 to 14-53-20. Then the Sayana position of the lagna would be 8 degrees 13
mts. 20 ses. Turn over the page where the cusps of various houses are given for
Delhi Latitude. Then you will get that Virgo 9-32 is the second cusp Libra 8-32
is the third cusp; fourth will be 10-32 Scorpio; fifth will be 13-32
Sagittarius; sixth will be 15-32 Capricorn and the other 6 cusps are 180
degrees opposite to these.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now we have got the Sayana position of the
12 cusps.. Deduct the Ayanamsa and convert them to Nirayana. The following
figure is the map for the query and hereafter we have to note down the position
of the planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For which time are we to note the position
of the planets? If you judge a chart immediately after calculations, then you
have to note the position of the planets at which you start the casting of the
horoscope for judgment. Cusps for the number can be done and kept ready as a
ready reckoner. You may keep a ready reckoner for any single locality for every
number between 1 and 249. Noting the position of the planets and in
continuation to judge will be done at any time. That time alone should be taken
for the position of the planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then are we to note for 7-30 A.M. I.S.T. or
are we to convert the time to L.M.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Hullo ! it is only to find the cusps
of the houses one is to find out the time in L.M.T. But to calculate the
position of the planets you have to take the Indian Standard time. Because the
position of the planets are for 12 noon Greenwich. That is the same position
for 5-30 P.M. LS.T. That is why I have given in my Ephemeris the position of
the planets for 5-30 P.M. I could have given the position of the planets for 12
noon I.S.T. But you cannot verify easily with that of Western Ephemeris and confirm
that mine is correct. So one can work with confidence. Doubt should never be
there. Therefore you calculate and insert in the map after deducting ayanamsa
from the figures obtained. Then the following is the horoscope for Judgment:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">

balance 5 years, 11 months 20 days. We have to presume that Mercury Dasa Rahu
Bhukti started on 30-1-68.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First Question: Is marriage promised?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note where the seventh cusp falls, it is in
Capricorn at 14-53-20. It is Moon star Jupiter sub. What does Jupiter signify?
Jupiter is occupying the second house promising increase in the number of the
members of the family by marriage. Hence marriage is promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second Question:-Who are the significators
of the houses 2, 7, 11 which houses denote the wedding?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Occupant of the constellation of a planet
is stronger than the occupant. Occupant of a house is stronger than the lord of
the house. This is the main principle of Krishnamurtiji.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore find out the occupant, of these
houses and the planets, if any deposited in the constellation of the occupant.
Then note down the occupant. Later find out the planets situated in the
constellation of the owners of the signs in which the cusps of the houses 2, 7
and 11 fall. Finally take the lords of the houses as well as those planets
conjoined with or aspected by the above significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second house extends from 16-12 Leo to
15-12 Virgo (you have to take cusp to cusp as a house and not like the
traditional astrologers, if you want to follow Krishnamurti Padhdhati.)
Mercury, Kethu and Jupiter are the occupants of the 2nd house. No planet is in
Kethu constellation. Rahu is in Jupiter's star; Moon, Sun are in the star of
Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Seventh house extends from 14-53-20 in
Capricorn to 16-12 in Aquarius. No planet is found in this arc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Eleventh house extends from Taurus to 22-12
Gemini. Venus is in this area and the three constellations of Venus are
Bharani. P.P. Guni and Poorvashda. Saturn and Mercury are the two planets in
its star. Therefore the strongest are Mercury, Rahu, Jupiter, Kethu, Saturn,
Venus, Moon and Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now the question arises how to select the
strongest and the fruitful ones.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Krishnamurtiji has discovered that the
ruling planets at the moment of judgment will be helpful and they are the real
benefactors. Today it is Wednesday governed by Mercury. The star is Ashlesha
ruled by Mercury. The sign is governed by Moon, Cancer. Lagna falls in Leo,
Kethu and Rahu are the two nodes which will represent Mercury as Kethu is
conjoined with Mercury and Rahu is aspected by Mercury. Krishnamurtiji has said
that Rahu or Kethu will give first of all the results indicated by the planets
with which they are conjoind or by which they are aspected.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence include the two nodes, Reject Sun,
take Kethu. Then when will the marriage come up?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury Dasa Rahu Bhukti Kethu Anthra or
Mercury Dasa Rahu Bhukti Moon Anthra. Mercury Dasa Rahu Bhukti Kethu Anthra is
mostly over. Moon Anthra will start after 7 months 24 days, i.e. on 7th April,
1970. It will run for 2 months and 16 days. Now we have to see in which
constellation and sub the significators will be transitting. As Mercury and
Moon are fast moving, take Rahu. Rahu comes to its own constellation on 7th
February, 1970. Then it will be in Venus sub till 25th April, 1970. Then it
will be in Kethu sub which is also a strong significator. Mercury will enter
into Rohini star governed by Moon in Venus sign. Hence the date of marriage
will be on the day when Sun transits in Venus sign, Moon star, Rahu sub, i.e..
25th May, 1970.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="12.1_Can I buy him.html">← 7 HOUSE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_12.2_When is the Marriage">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="12.3_Re-union With Husband.html">Re-union With Husband →</a></div></body>
