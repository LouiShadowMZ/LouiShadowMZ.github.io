son-having left his house, without any information, the father may be roaming
about or might have attained eternal rest. Who can say what could have happened
to him? or if he is alive leading a secluded life, who can credit
scientifically except learned astrologers?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out the truth, horary astrology is
the most correct method as the horoscope of the native who is absent or that of
the son may or may not be correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So ask the son to give a number between 1
and 249.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The son says" 139",</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Erect a chart for the moment at which the
astrologer begins to work for the judgment. One need not worry about! the time
taken to cast the chart if he at once proceeds to work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of the commencement of the working of
the chart is to be compared to "Boopadana" i.e., the moment when a
child is out of the mother in full. Time of commencement of judgment in
continuation without a break is similar to the child after a few minutes have
passed from the moment of Boopadana. Hence one should take only the moment when
one starts erecting a chart and in continuation offers the prediction. Now it
is 7-20 A.M. L.S.T. on 24-7-1969. Place of judgment 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
33' North. So, erect a horoscope, taking the ascendant as 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Libra-Nirayana which is the position for the number 139 given by
the son (Refer the ready reckoner given in July 1968 issue Astrology and
Athrishta or the book Krishnamurti Ephemeris or Krishnamurti Padhdhati).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">

</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the 9th house represents father, his
walking out of the house should be judged from the houses 3, 9 and 12 counted
from 9th house, i.e., to this lagna 11th, 5th and 8th houses to Libra,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter and Kethu are in 11, Rahu is in 5
and Venus is in 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is in Jupiter star: None in Kethu's
star: None in Rahu star, Saturn is in Venus star. As Jupiter Dasa is running,
he ought to have left the house during Jupiter Dasa Saturn Bhukthi Kethu Anthra
Rahu Shookshma in April, May 1963 or Jupiter Dasa Kethu Bhukthi Saturn Anthra
Rahu Shookshma in January 1968. Now we have to see the transit on both
occasions and fix up.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"True, Sir: my father left on
9-5-1963".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Good".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Please find out when he will return
if he is alive".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For any action done by one, the 12th house
therefrom is to undo it. Separation came because of the significators of 3, 9
and 12 houses counted from the 9th. Therefore take houses 2, 8 and 11 counted
from the 9th. It means judge the houses 10, 4 and 7th counted from lagna. No
planet occupies any of these 3 houses 10, 4 or 7. Owners are Moon, Saturn and
Mars. No planet in Moon's star. Sun, Mars and Mercury are in Saturn star. Venus
is in Mars star. His return will be during Jupiter Dasa Sun Bhukthi Venus Anthra
Mars Shookshma, i.c.. around 4th week of July, 1971.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"How do you take Sun sub-period. It
can be Moon or Mars sub-period also."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"True. Only here the ruling planets
will guide you". Now the point which rises in the east is Simha-Leo lagna.
It is neither Karkata-Cancer, nor Scorpio.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Secondly, the lagna is in Poorvapalguni
star ruled by Venus. Further Moon is in Venus sign-Jupiter star. Query is to
find out the father's date of return. So take the ruling planets. Jupiter Dasa
Venus Bhukthi, Sun, Moon and Mars Anthra passed away. So, the next date is only
Jupiter Dasa Sun Bhukthi Venus Anthra,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also note the transit. Jupiter from its
retrograde motion takes direct course in Mars sign Jupiter star in the 4th week
of July, 1971. Venus will be in Jupiter star Sun sub. Sun will be in Moon sign.
Mars in exaltation in its own star. Saturn in Sun's star Venus sub. So one
should predict 4th week of July. 1971 to be the safe return of the father.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"So, two more years."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes. What to do?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Can I pray to God, Sir? Will it not
help for early return?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Whether you pray or not, publish in
the paper or not, his date of return will and must be 4th week July, 1971
