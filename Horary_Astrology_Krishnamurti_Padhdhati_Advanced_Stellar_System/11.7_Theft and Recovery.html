<body><h2 id="heading_11.7_Theft and Recovery_0"><span lang="EN-US">Theft and Recovery</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One who deprives you of your movables is a
thief. Lagna indicates the querist, whose property has been stolen. Seventh
house indicates the thief. If the stolen property belongs to the querist's wife
or querist's husband, from lagna find out the thief; if it belongs to his
younger brother, the ninth house; if it belongs to the querist's mother, the
tenth house; if it belongs to his son, the 11th house; if it belongs to his
maternal uncle, the 12th house, if it belongs to his father, the 3rd house will
indictae the thief. Property lost will be judged by houses 2nd, 6th and 11th
houses counted from the houses indicating the thief.</span></p><h3 id="heading_11.7_Theft and Recovery_1"><span lang="EN-US">Whereabouts of thief</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the tenth and Seventh houses (indicating
the thief) significators form good aspect, the thief is at his house. If the
seventh house (showing the thief) lord is connected with 6th and 9th, the thief
has gone to a nearby place (because ninth house is thief to the 7th and houses
3 and 12 indicate short journey and stay in a neighbouring place; but if the
seventh lord is connected with 3 and 6 houses, he has gone to a far far away
place. If the seventh lord happened to be in a movable sign, the thief is still
going on farther and farther away: if it is in a fixed sign and happens to be
in the tenth house, he is in his own house; if the seventh lord is in the fifth
house, which is a fixed sign, he will be in a friend's house; if the lord of
seventh is in the third house in a fixed sign he should be staying with a
stranger, if Rahu is in the third house, he will be in a rented place: Jupiter
in 3 suggests temple, school, court, etc. Mars and Venus show hotel. </span></p><h3 id="heading_11.7_Theft and Recovery_2"><span lang="EN-US">Recovery of lost property</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the significators of the houses 2, 6 and
11 agree (counted from the house indicating the person whose property is lost)
with the ruling planets of the day, the property lost will be recovered. If the
ruling planets are connected with 5, 8 and 12 houses: it is lost once for all.</span></p><h3 id="heading_11.7_Theft and Recovery_3"><span lang="EN-US">Time of recovery of lost property</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Work out the dasa, etc., for the moment and
in the conjoined period of the significators of houses 2, 6 and 11 (again
counted from the house indicating the person whose property is lost), the lost
properyt will be regained. To assure yourself, you work out backwards. The
period that would have been operating on the day of theft, will be the
significators of the houses 5, 8 and 12. The dasa lord in most of the cases
will be the same at the time of loss and also regaining. In such cases, dasa
lord will be the significator of 5 and 2 or 5 and 6 or 8 and 11 or 11 and 12.
If the Dasa lord is not connected with 2 or 6 or 11, in that Dasa period one
cannot regain as it would be the significator of 5 or 8 or 12 alone. Similarly
the lords of the sub period and sub sub period are to be judged.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="11.6_Entangied Money.html">← Entangied Money</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_11.7_Theft and Recovery">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="11.8_Air India Strike.html">Air India Strike →</a></div></body>
