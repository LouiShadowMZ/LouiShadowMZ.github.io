in medical test in the early stages of the conception. Frog test may fail. But
Astrology will not. If one is anxious to know whether one is pregnant or not,
then the sub-lord of the 5th cusp should be deposited in the constellation of a
planet which is the significator of 2 or 5 or 11 and also deposited in the
fruitful sign. If the sub-lord and the lord of the constellation were to occupy
barren signs, give her mental strength that she is not on the family way. This
particular question will be put by many in the 21st century. Therefore,
youngsters can be verifying this fact by asking a number from the girls within
a few weeks after getting married.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="10.9_Will my Wife Deliver a Twin.html">← Will my Wife Deliver a Twin</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_10.10_Am I Pregnant">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="10.11_When is the Child Birth.html">When is the Child Birth →</a></div></body>
