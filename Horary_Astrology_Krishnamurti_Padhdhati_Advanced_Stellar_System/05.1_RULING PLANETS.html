particular moment is ruled by a few planets. That is, one is to note (1) the
exact position of the zodiac which would be rising for that moment for that
locality on that day, (2) the name of the day, (3) the constellation in which
Moon would be passing then, (4) the sign in which Moon would be. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Everyday has its lord as follows:</span>— </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1.Sunday is ruled by Sun, 2. Monday by
Moon, 3. Tuesday by Mars, 4 Wednesday by Mercury. 5. Thursday by Jupiter 6.
Friday by Venus and 7 Saturday by Saturn. If Rahu or Kethu were to occupy a
sign then Rahu and Kethu will act as an agent of the lord of the sign.Suppose
Rahu is in Aquarius or Capricorn then Rahu also should be taken as a ruling
planet for Saturday or when Capricorn or Aquarius is the lagna or the sign in
which Moon passes. Kethu in Leo will represent Sunday. If Kethu were to be in
Cancer it indicates Mondays. Kethu in Gemini represents Virgo also. If Moon or
Lagna is in Virgo, Kethu should be included. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The lord of the star in which the Ascendant
rises in the east. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The lord of the sign rising in the east,
i.e. the lagna. If a planet owning two houses, rules this sign and either Rahu
or Kethu were to be in either of the two signs, node must be included. The lord
of the star in which Moon passes comes next. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The lord of the sign in which Moon is at
that time. This lord may own another sign and a node may be in either of the
two. Node should be taken for judgment. All the above lords are called the
Ruling planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Among these, these deposited in the
constellation of a retrograde planet should be rejected. Those which are retro­grade
will cause delay till it is retrograde and they will be fruitful, after they in
direct motion reach a particular sub. Planets which are in the sub of those who
are detrimental to the matters of a particular Bhava, indicate when the matter
will fall through. Those which are in direct motion and which are the
significators of the matter under judgment, they give the desired results. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many instances are given how to judge and
how they are helpful. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><h3 id="heading_05.1_RULING PLANETS_2"><span lang="EN-US">WHEN WILL THE TRUNK-CALL MATERIALISE</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Consider the houses 3, 9 and 11. Take the
sub-lord of the 11th cusp and find out whether the lord of the constellation in
which the sub-lord is deposited, is not retrograde. If it were to be
retrograde, no purpose will be served by that call. If the lord of the
constellation in which third cusp sub-lord is deposited is retrograde, the call
will not materialise. If the sub-lord of the 9th cusp is retrograde, the other
party cannot be contacted. But if they are in direct motion find out the
significators of the houses 3, 9 and 11 as it will materialise. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since the call is to materialise in minutes
or in hours one need not work out dasa balance, one has to note only the
movement of the ascendant and calculate when the ascendant will come to the
position in the zodiac which is governed by the ruling planets and also the
significators of the houses 3, 9 and 11. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A planet which is the significator of 3
should also be the significators of 9 or 11. Similarly the significator of 9
also should be the significator of 3 or 11. The significator of 11 should be
the significator of 3 or 9. Such of the significators alone must be taken. If a
planet is not the significator of 9 and 11 but is the significator of 6 or 8 or
12, one can take it that, that particular planet is not the significator for
this trunk-call, even though it is the significator of the third house. Similarly
if a planet is the significator. of the 9 and it is also the significator of 6
or 8 or 12, and is not the significator of 3 or 11, then the party in the other
end will be absent, only when significator of the 9th is also a significator or
either 3 or 11, then alone he wil[ answer the call. If a planet is the
significator of the 11th house and not the significator of 3 or 9, but is the
significator of other houses reject this planet. Select those planets which are
the significator of the 11th house and also the significator of 3 or 9 or both </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On 21-9-69. a telephone trunk call to Kandy

was arranged at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. I was to go there with my friend. My
friend was expected to arrive before 1 P.M. I waited for some more time but
even at 1-10, he did not come. My wife, being anxious to know whether he will
come or not, asked me to predict his time of arrival.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Immediately, I took the ruling planets as
the significators, and calculated. I found out that my friend would surely
arrive and it would be around 1-47 P.M. to 1-49 P.M. Why? The calculation is as
follows:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets were</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) The day was Sunday: ruler was SUN</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) The star in which Moon was transitting

was Libra, ruled by Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) The lagna, rising at the time of query
was Taurus ruled by Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(5) Rising star in which lagna falls was
Moon. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, Ruling planet was SUN, RAHU, VENUS and
MOON. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets indicate the nature of
query and time of fructification of query. Lord of one in the 11th house
promises the meeting, ie., his coming. So his coming to our house is definite
very certain When, is the question? Since the matter relates only to minor
event, which is to take place within a few minutes or a few hours, the transit
of the lagna is to be considered and I calculated the position in the Zodiac to
rise in the East. It can be Venus sign Moon star Sun sub. So, I said 1-55 P.M.
Then my wife asked why it should not be Rahu star Sun or Moon sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I replied "Rahu star is in Mercury
sign, Mercury is not one of the ruling planets."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then, why not Mrigasira in Venus
sign," asked she. I said Mars is the lord of Mrigasira and it is not one
of the ruling planets. Then she tried and thought loudly Punarvasu can't be as
Jupiter is not one of the ruling planets. Pushya can't be as Saturn is not one
of the ruling planets. So also Aslesha. Thus she thought one after another and
said "Why can't he come when lagna is in Venus sign. Rahu star, Sun or
Moon sub. 1 said the function is at 3 P.M. Lagna can be in Venus sign Rahu star
after 10 P.M. Where will young men go after 10 P.M.? Not to a colleague's
house. So you have no alternative. This is the only answer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Actually when my friend arrived, the lagna
was transiting in the sub sub of Rahu in the sub of SUN in the star Rohini
ruled by Moon in the sign Taurus (22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 50</span>′<span lang="EN-US">) governed by Venus. The time was a few seconds to 1-48 P.M. LS.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As, invariably in all cases, without any
single failure, using ruling planets one can decide correctly the nature of
event, and predict precisely the moment, what can one understand. The Ayanamsa
given out by the Editor alone is correct. If you take any other Ayanamsa, you
will get wrong timing using ruling planets, judge thousands of cases. Verify
then and there. Not only ruling planets are very useful to offer correct
prediction, but also this proves beyond doubt that Krishnamurti Ayanamsa is
alone very very correct and any other figure used is never correct. Ayanamsa or
any problem is not a vexed one, if intelligent research workers with open mind,
forgetting the number of years of so-called experience in wrong lines, honestly
work. Solution comes. A boy calls that he has more than 3 years' experience in
one particular class, say, VIII Standard. For the fourth year, he studies in
the same class. Another talented boy comes and joins in that class. The
longstanding student again fails: The new entrant scores distinction, bags
prizes and is respected and regarded. Similarly K. P. followers win the
appreciation of the consultants by offering uncanny predictions; credit goes to
my intelligent students making correct calculations and honest attempts. There
is nothing as Tendency, You may desire to have anything in a few minutes. You
can get only at the time predicted by K. P. K. P. unfolds the destiny
correctly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><h3 id="heading_05.1_RULING PLANETS_4"><span lang="EN-US">When will the servant sent to the bank_ return after

Taurus; no Mercury star in Taurus; but there is the Sun's star, Karthik. Hence
Taurus sign and Sun star: 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> degree Taurus to 10 degree
Taurus. In that, we have to take the sub-lord. As Saturn is the lord of lagna

Saturn and sub sub of Mercury. That is 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 30' must rise

Reject those ruling planets situated in the constellation of the retrograde

Jupiter from the position occupied by Jupiter at that time. If one asks which
month I can celebrate the marriage of my daughter in that year, Sun must reach
the position governed by the Ruling planets. But if one asks in which year one
will build a house, move Jupiter. If one wants to know when his fever will
subside move Moon. If one wants to know when his wife would deliver and adds
that it is the fourth month, then move the Sun. If it is the same month for
delivery, move Moon: If expected on the same day, take lagna. If one says that
one would like to start a business in a few years, then move Jupiter. This is

the constellation in which the sub- lord of the 4th cusp is in a fixed sign,
the passengers may have to stay in a place for long duration. But if the lord
of the constellation in which the sub-lord is deposited, is in a common sign,

like Saturn there will be undue delay and also the passengers have to undergo
much of sufferings. If it is Mars or Rahu, some repairs also may be needed. But
if the lord of the constellation in which the sub-lord of the 4th is deposited,
is conjoined with a benefic, then after delay we will reach our home safe. If

clocks and learned medical attendants to attend upon the labour case and note
down the exact time of the birth, yet the parents fail to keep a record of the
correct time of the birth in many cases. Further, nowadays, there are many
refugees who had left their belongings in the countries where they were and had
come here: a few lost their parents during the disturbance; most of them lost
their horoscopes. Therefore, it is not possible to know the correct time of the
birth, even though they may be knowing the date of birth. To find birth time,
there are various rules given in Hindu Traditional System: the Westerners
follow pre-natal epoch. All these methods are useless for such customers. Only
the ruling planets at the moment of judgment will be useful and innumerable
instances are given in the magazine "Astrology &amp; Athrishta ".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Procedure: Note the constellation in which
the lagna at the moment of judgment falls; then the lord of the sign where the
ascendant is find out in which constellation, Moon is passing and know the lord
of the constellation and lord of the rasi. You should, for astrological
purposes, take that sunrise to next sunrise is a Day. Therefore, know the lord
of the day. Hence these five planets happen to be the ruling planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Write down all these ruling planets. Note
which are deposited in the constellation of the planets in retrograde motion.
Reject them. Then take those planets which are in the constellation of the
planets in direct motion. You have to select the ascendant. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It will fall in a sign and in that in a
star and in that star in a sub and in that sub in a sub sub. The lords of all
these must agree with the ruling planets at the moment of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you get some three positions in the
Zodiac, you enquire the consultant whether he was born in the morning or day
time or night; according to the date of birth find out in which sign he could
have been born. Then in that sign select the constellation and sub governed by
the ruling planets. Then, this is the exact position of the lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Above rule had been tested by most
intelligent students, highly qualified, very well placed in life who used to
put the query in the class and used to ask the correct time of their birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Already they know their correct time; but
to ascertain whether this method works out correctly hundreds and hundreds of
the students have tested, verified and were very happy. Readers will be pleased
to understand that everywhere I came very correct. They were also very much
impressed, convinced and absolutely satisfied. I had already published in the
magazine "Astrology &amp; Athrishta" how without seeing the native I
had given the correct time of birth, the nakshathra of birth, the rasi of birth,
etc., to the interested party who had the real urge. I had not tested only with
people who are not known to many, but with people holding such a position which
will be even to-day from 1 to 10, in India. Therefore, the above method alone
is to be followed to find out the correct time of birth and also correct
position of one's lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A gentleman says that he is born between
