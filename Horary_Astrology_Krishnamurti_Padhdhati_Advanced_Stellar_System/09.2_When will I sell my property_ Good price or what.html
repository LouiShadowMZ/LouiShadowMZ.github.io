days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Property is indicated by the 4th house,
counted from lagna. The 3rd house is 12th to 4th house. One who purchases the
property is shown by the 7th house. The houses 10 and 5 are respectively 4th
(property) and 11th. (fulfilment of his desire) counted from 7th house.
Therefore selling away property is shown by the houses 3, 5 and 10 counted from
lagna of the consultant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You want to sell away your property. Anyone
with whom you deal is shown by the 7th house. Whether he will be able to
purchase your property or not is to be seen from the 4th cusp counted from 7th,
i.c. 10th cusp counted from lagna. Judge whether the sublord of the 10th cusp
is either retrograde or deposited in the constellation whose lord is
retrograde. If the sub-lord is retrograde, wait. If the lord of constellation
in which sub-lord is deposited, is retrograde, then you will not be able to
sell the property. If they are in direct motion and if this sub- lord is also a
significator of either 3rd or 10th house, then you can and will sell.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 10th cusp is Tulam 11 6' i.e. in Venus
sign Rahu star and Saturn sub. The sub-lord Saturn is not retrograde. It is
deposited in the constellation of Venus who is also not retrograde. Venus is
deposited in 5th bhava. It owns the houses 5 and 10. There is no planet in the
10th bhava. Therefore the sub-lord of 10th cusp</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) is not retrograde,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ii) is deposited in the constellation
whose lord is not retrograde, and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(iii) is also the significator of houses 5
and 10. Therefore you will sell.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Houses 3, 5 and 10 are to be judged for
selling and 3 and 12 for giving possession.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The rules applicable to sell land or
building are the same. The 3rd house is unoccupied. Jupiter owns it. Rahu and
Kethu represent Jupiter as Kethu is conjoined with it and Rahu occupies its
sign Meena.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(This is how nodes represent the planets)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore planets in the constellations of
Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu will be strong significators of 3rd house. This does
not mean that Rahu, Kethu and Jupiter cannot give 3rd house results. They can
also give. But the planets in their stars are stronger to give the results.
(Tenant stronger.) Sun and Rahu are in Jupiter star. Mercury is in Rahu star
and none is in Kethu star. Therefore Sun, Rahu, Mercury, Jupiter and Kethu are
the significators of 3rd house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5th house is occupied by Venus. No planet
is in 10th bhava. Venus owns both 5th and 10th houses. Saturn is in the
constellation of Venus. Therefore Saturn is a strong significator of both the
houses 5 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th house is unoccupied. Its owner is
Jupiter. Therefore the planets Sun, Rahu, Mercury, Jupiter and Kethu are the
significators of 12th house also.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Finally the significators of houses 3, 5
and 10 are Sun, Rahu, Mercury, Jupiter, Kethu and Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun Dasa balance is 5 years 5 months and 26
days. In this Rahu Bhukti operates between 29-12-1970 and 23-1-1971. Both Sun
and Rahu are significators. Yet, during this period, you will not be able to
sell your property. Why? Because Saturn and Moon are together in one sign.
Whenever Saturn and Moon are together in one sign, it is called
Poonaraphoo". This implies that the event will materialise on subsequent
attempts. That is why you will not be able to sell away your property during
Sun Dasa Rahu Bhukti. In Sun Dasa Saturn Bhukti you will make frequent attempts
to dispose. This period runs from 11-11-1971 to 23-10-1972 whenever Saturn is a
significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During this period you will enter into an
agreement during Mercury Anthra between 5-1-1972 and 23-2-1972 (Mercury is for
agreement and also strong significator of 3rd house) and finally hand over the
possession of your property in Kethu Anthra during 23-2-1972 and 13-3-1972.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">﻿</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It does not allow others to give; it drags
on till its period or sub-period passes. In its sub-period and the sub
sub-period of another significator, it offers desirable results. Saturn is a
foolhardy mother-in-law, who was in the bath room. Some persons came for
donation Son wanted to give Rs. 5- Daughter- in-law had the mind to add one
more five. When the mother- in-law was informed. she ordered "Wait, where
is the hurry?" Then she came out after bath, dress, make up etc., and gave
Rs. 151. Thus Saturn will behave.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The exact dates will be found out from
transit of Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Date of agreement will be 20-1-1972
when Sun transits Saturn sign Sun star Mercury sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ii) Date of giving actual possession will
be 11-3-1972 when Sun transits Saturn sign Jupiter star Kethu sub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out whether the property will be
sold for good price or not we have to judge the dasa lord. It is Sun. It is
deposited in the constellation of Jupiter, Jupiter is deposited in 8th bhava
and owns 12th. Therefore Sun is a significator of houses 8 and 12. Both the
houses 8 and 12 are favourable to the purchaser and therefore purchaser gains.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"So, I will lose in the
transaction." As an astrologer, 1 do not want to say that you will lose.
It is implied.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrologers generally are devotees of some
God or Goddess. Vak Siddhi will be there. So mostly talk in the affirmative;
let the negative be implied. If one asks. "Has the newspaperwala
come" do not reply, "No" say, he is coming. If one asks whether
you would be going to office on that day and if you are on leave, say I go only
tomorrow". Do not reply No. If one wants to have change for a Hundred
Rupee note and you do not have do not say "Sorry": Say "Shall I
get you from my friend".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.1_Will my 3rd son construct a building.html">← 4 HOUSE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.2_When will I sell my property_ Good price or what">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.3_When can I have a Vehicle_ Bicycle_ Motor-cycle or Car.html">When can I have a Vehicle_ Bicycle_ Motor-cycle or Car →</a></div></body>
