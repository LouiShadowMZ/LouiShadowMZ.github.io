and either (2) Krishnamurti Ephemeris or Raphael's Ephemeris for the year when
the chart is to be erected. (3) The Table showing the commencement of the sub
according to the number given by the consultant. (4) Correct time when the
astrologer begins to judge.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The time to be taken for Horary Chart:
Whether one has the horoscope or not, whenever there is an immediate problem,
one would like to know or confirm by horary astrology also. So, one may visit
the Astrologer's place and the astrologer may also start attending to one's
problem, or one may send it by post or send a messenger to consult or ask by
phone. Now, the doubt arises whether one has to take the time when a person
begins to write a letter to the astrologer; or when he posts it in his
locality; or when the astrologer receives it from the postman: or when the
astrologer begins to judge. We must take only the time of judgment. The time at
which the urge comes in mind of the constulant may be compared to the urge of a
expectant mother needing a midwife's assistance. Posting the letter is similar
to getting a conveyance to go to the nursing home. Postman delivering the
letter is similar to the expectant mother getting admitted into the labour
ward. But the moment when the astrologer sits for judgment is similar to the
moment the whole body of the child has got separated from that of the mother.
If one were to erect a horoscope for the moment when the urge was in the mind
of the consultant, it will show whether the astrologer would answer at all or
not: whether the astrologer would take long time to give the reply; and also
whether the letter was mis-carried or delivered properly to the astrologer. For
the time when the postman delivers the letter if the horoscope is cast, it will
show when the astrologer will take it for judgment. But if one takes the time
when the astrologer erects a horoscope for the moment of the judgment, then the
planets I will be occupying such a position which gives a clear picture to the
astrologer. The truth will dawn in his mind. Therefore, the time of judgment
alone must be taken to give the results for the query put by the consultant and
the number which he had written should remain the same.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Accordingly, for the past 18 years, work
had been done and uniformly everywhere the results had come very true. The
results had proved to be marvellous and very helpful to the customer.
Therefore, readers must take only the time of judgment whatever may be the time
of query by the consultant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Take Standard time: Every nation has got
its own standard time, and for the erection of the horoscope, one need not
convert the time of judgment, noted in standard time to local meantime and then
refer to Sidereal time and so on. Because, Horary Astrology, according to
Krishnamurti Padhdhati, depends on the number given by the consultant and every
number refers to a particular sign, star and sub as the Ascendant. One has to
take only the commencing position of the sub, as Ascendant. Therefore, there is
no necessity to convert the standard time to local meantime and then by noting
down the sidereal time, to arrive at the sidereal time at the moment of
judgment. Because, we are not erecting a map with the 12 cusps for the moment
of judgment. It is the number which we take and each number has got a definite
position in the Nirayana Zodiac. Having this as Ascendant, one is to calculate
the other 11 cusps for the latitude of the place of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Table showing the number, the sign-lord,
