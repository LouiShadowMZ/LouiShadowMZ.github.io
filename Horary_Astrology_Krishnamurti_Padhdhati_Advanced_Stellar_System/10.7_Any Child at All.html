of the abortive node Kethu who is the significator of the houses 5 and 6.
Therefore the question is about the child birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Is it promised or not? As the question is
from the male note the 11th and then only the fifth. The eleventh cusp is in 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 38' in Capricorn in Saturn sign Moon star and the sub of one in the
12th house, So the 11th cusp denies. The fifth cusp is in 14 38 in the barren
sign Leo in the sign of barren planet Sun star of the planet in the 12th house
to the fifth and in the sub whose lord is in the 12th to the 5th house. This
also does not promise. Generally houses 2, 5 and 11 are judged to note the time
when one can have a child. Here the second house is vacant. Its lord is Mars.
It is in the constlellation of the planet in the 6th house occupying the strong
barren sign. Mars in 8 has no strength as it is also in sub of Rahu in 12. Lord
of 2 is so spoiled that it is in 8, it is in the constellation of the planet in
6, and it is in sub of one in 12. Then how can there be an increase in the
family by the birth of a child. It is out of question</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5th house is occupied by Sun. It is in the
constellation of Venus in the 4th house denying any child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord of 5 Moon is in Kethu constellation
who is in 6 and in the sub of the planet in 4 and is conjoined with retrograde
plant Saturn, who is lord of 11 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 11th house is unoccupied. Its lord is
Saturn. It is retrograde in the twelfth house to two. Hence there is no doubt
at all.
