</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is necessary to find out whether it
refers to vehicle or to any of the other matters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Only Krishnamurti Padhdhati is useful to pinpoint.
If the sub-lord of the 4th cusp in the Horary Chart is either Venus being the
significator of 4 or if the sub-lord is deposited in the constellation of the
significator of the 4th who has any connection with Venus, one will have either
a vehicle or buy some furniture, (Venus, if not the significator of 4 it can't
indicate though it is said to be the chief governor of vehicle.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again to differentiate between these two,
judge as follows: If the sub-lord or the lord of the constellation in which the
sub-lord is deposited (being the significator of the 4th and also connected
with Venus) were to be deposited in a movable sign, it shows vehicle.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if it is in a common sign, it may be
vehicle or cradle-like furniture which can move to and fro.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if it is in a fixed sign, it is only
furniture.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord of the 4th is Mars or if
the sub-lord is deposited in a constellation who is the significator of the 4th
and in any manner connected with Mars, it refers to land or building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord is Moon or if the sub-lord
is deposited in the constellation of a planet who is the significator of the
4th and is in any manner connected with Moon, the mother is indicated by the
4th.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-ford of the 4th cusp is Jupiter
or Mercury, or if the sub-lord is in the constellation of the planet who is the
significator of the 4th and is any manner connected with either Jupiter or
Mercury or both, the matter refers to one's education.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub-lord of the 4th cusp is Saturn
or if the sub-lord is in the constellation of a planet which is the
significator of the 4th and also connected with Saturn, it refers to mine, mine
products, excavation, treasure etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus we have to differentiate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Will the vehicle be 2 wheeled or 3 wheeled
or 4 wheeled or multi, like train or 6 or 8 wheeled lorries etc., or to wheeled
ship or the flying helicopter or plane may be the next question.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. If it is a bicycle, manual labour is
needed. Hence Saturn will be connected with the significators indicating
purchase of a vehicle.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. If it is a motor cycle, there is the
machinery; petrol or oil is used. Hence the significator should be connected
with Mars, Venus and Moon. Venus and Moon indicate petrol, Mars machinery.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. If it is 4 wheeled one, then also these
three planets should be connected with those significators who promise the
purchase of the vehicle.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. If the significator of the fourth house
promising purchase of a vehicle is deposited in the sub, the lord of which is
in any of the signs Gemini, Virgo, first half of Sagittarius or Aquarius, then
it is two wheeled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. If the significator indicating purchase
of a vehicle and if it were to be in the sub, the lord of which is deposited in
bestial or 4 legged sign, or its constellation lord, then it can be car and
anything similar to it. Aries, Taurus, Leo, second half of Sagittarius and
Capricorn are the bestial signs: 4 wheeled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. If the significator of the purchase of
the car is connected with Saturn, it shows self-drive. If it is connected with
Jupiter there is a driver appointed. If both Jupiter and Saturn are connected
sometimes he himself will drive and sometimes the driver. If the significator
of the fourth is also the significator of 2, 6 and 10 he will buy one and drive
for other's use like one's own taxi or private tourist car. If the significator
is also connected with Rahu or Kethu and is also the significator of 10 then he
uses the office car.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. If the significator is deposited in the
sub of a planet who is the significator of the 4th house and it is in the
constellation ruled by a planet, deposited in the watery sign, it may be a
boat-hand driven, if Saturn is one of the planets or motor boat if Mars, Venus
and Moon are connected. If only Mars and Moon are connected it should be driven
on steam when it will be a ship. Saturn shows submarine. If the significator of
the 4th house is very strong and it is deposited in the sub of a planet deposited
in the constellation of one occupying airy sign, one will buy aeroplane or
helicopter. This significator should be connected with Mars, Venus and Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus if one calmly studied, he can find out
the difference. One can have many if Mercury and duel sign are connected with
the significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number given is 217. The horoscope is as
follows.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 4th cusp is Rishaba 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 30' i.c. in Venus sign Moon star and Venus sub. The sub-lord Venus
is deposited in the second half of Dhanus. Dhanus is a common sign and its
second half falls in a bestial or four legged sign. Further Mars aspects Venus
by its 4th aspect. Therefore you will have a four-wheeled vehicle.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">﻿</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The next step is to find out significators
of 4, 9, 10 and 11. The significators of all the houses are tabulated as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">

</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From the above table it can be seen that
the significator, of the houses 4, 9, 10 and 11 are Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Kethu: all the nine planets signify. When so
much group signifies the best course and the only scentific method is to go for
ruling planets and find out the common between the significators and the ruling
planets. The ruling planets are the lords of the day, Moon sign, star and lagna
at the moment of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The day is Sunday ruled by Sun. Moon,
transits Kethu star Aswini in the sign Aries owned by Mars. The lagna is
Rishaba owned by Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All the ruling planets are not always
beneficial. Those which are in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet
will not give results. Sun is in the constellation of retrograde Saturn. Reject
it. Others are in the constellation and sub of planets in direct motion. Take
them. They are Kethu, Mars and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">They will give you car during their
conjoined period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to dasa-bhukti at the time of
judgment Kethu Dasa balance is 2 years, 8 months and 7 days from 1-12-68. The
bhukties which are still to operate are those of Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury.
None of them is a ruling planet. Next comes Venus Dasa. (Venus is the strongest
in the ruling planets, as it is the lord of the lagna. In ruling planets,
always the lord of lagna is stronger than the lord of the star, the lord of
star is stronger than the lord of Moon sign and the lord of Moon sign is
stronger than the lord of the day.) Venus Dasa Venus bhukti runs between
8-8-1971 and 8-12-1974. In this you will get vehicle either in Mars Anthra or
in Kethu Anthra. Mars is the lord of Moon sign in the ruling planets. But Kethu
is the lord of the constellation. So Kethu is stronger than Mars and therefore
Kethu Anthra will give you car. It runs between 28-9-1974 and 8-12-1974.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To find out the exact date of purchase of
car consider the transit of Sun. Sun transits Venus sign Mars star Kethu sub on
18-10-1974. Therefore you must have the vehicle on this date only (Never
earlier-nor later).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.2_When will I sell my property_ Good price or what.html">← When will I sell my property_ Good price or what</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.3_When can I have a Vehicle_ Bicycle_ Motor-cycle or Car">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.4_When can I dispose my vehicle.html">When can I dispose my vehicle →</a></div></body>
