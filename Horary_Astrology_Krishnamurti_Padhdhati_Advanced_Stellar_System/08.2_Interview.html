<body><h2 id="heading_08.2_Interview_0"><span lang="EN-US">Interview</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Interview means that two people have to
meet and discuss. The consultant wishes to see the person. His desire is to be
fulfilled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore one should judge the houses 3
(for meeting, interview, discussion), the 3rd to the seventh i.c.. the 9th; and
the 11th houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub-lord of the 11th if tenanted in a
constellation the lord of which is in direct motion, sooner or later he will
have the interview. But if the sub-lord of the 11th is deposited in the
constellation of a planet in retrograde motion, he cannot have the interview.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If one takes the ruling planets and works
out, the person is to wait till that position of the zodiac ascends in the east
which is governed by the ruling planets deposited in the constellation of those
in direct motion. But the interview will be denied if they are deposited in the
constellation of those in retrograde motion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrology being a divine science,
invariably, in all cases both the methods will give the same answer. It is a
wonderful science. All the scholars and students following K.P. will give the
same answer, as mathematics. Simple and straightforward method producing the
same results even though the astrologers are different. Only when there are
thousands of slokas and each interprets as he wishes, each astrologer will vary
and give different results and the consultant will be confused further.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.1_Appeal-Succeeful or not.html">← 3 HOUSE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.2_Interview">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.3_Is the report true or false.html">Is the report true or false →</a></div></body>
