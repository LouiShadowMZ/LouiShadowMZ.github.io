Society, Jaipur.)  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">President &amp; Learned Members,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mr. Krishnamurti has studied thoroughly
both the Western and the Hindu system, and he openly points out the failures.
He has found out a method which is popularly known as Krishnamurti Padhdhati or
Advanced Stellar Astrology. From the magazine published by him (Astrology and
Athrishta), it is clear that hundreds of students in big cities throughout
India are being educated by Mr. Krishnamurti, and he has systematized Astrology
in scientific lines. He delivers lectures. So, it has been decided to have a study
circle so that students and scholars of Astrology can assemble together and
exchange their views, and also teach the new entrants to this field. The
competent members will carry out the research study and students will assist
them in collecting the data, erecting correct horoscopes, and furnishing full
details. Mr. Krishnamurti will put us on the right path by frequently visiting
Jaipur. Time is ever-changing, nothing is stationary, modern outlook and living
are absolutely different from the time of our Maharishis. Therefore, we have to
render this science useful to the present-day conditions, scholarship to go
overseas, air travel, varieties of professions, education in various subjects,
etc. With this view, we have started a branch of his Institute and the study
circle titled as *Rajasthan Astrological Research Study Circle*, inaugurated by
Mr. Krishnamurti. I take this opportunity to express our grateful thanks to the
president and the Members of Indo-German Society for having extended the
invitation to Mr. Krishnamurti to deliver the lectures here, whose real and
valuable services are well recognized by all of us. When Mr. Krishnamurti
visited Jaipur previously under the lucky Presidentship of Hon'ble Minister Mr.
B. N. Joshi and Mr. Rameshwar Prasad Dhumani, they opened a branch and
inaugurated this study circle at the auspicious time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="01.1_INTRODUCTION.html">← SECTION ONE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_01.2_About the author by various people">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="01.3_ASTROLOGY_AN OCCULT SCIENCE.html">ASTROLOGY_AN OCCULT SCIENCE →</a></div></body>
