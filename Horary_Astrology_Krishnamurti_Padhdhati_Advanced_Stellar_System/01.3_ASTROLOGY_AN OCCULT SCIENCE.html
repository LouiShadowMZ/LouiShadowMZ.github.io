as the age of the Vedas. It depends on the position of the planets ascertained
astronomically. It explains the celestial phenomena and the corresponding
terrestrial events. The true meaning of Astrology is the </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Message of the Stars.</span>”<span lang="EN-US"> By using the salient
principles of Astrology depending on the position of the planets ascertained
astronomically, one can forecast events for the benefit of all, and as such, it
is a useful science for interpreting nature.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Astronomy is excellent but it must
come</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Up into life to have its full value,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">And not remain there as Globes and
Spaces"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">—<span lang="EN-US">Emerson</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The whole world is run according to a well-defined
plan. Nothing happens by chance. Astrology does not permit one to classify
anything as an accident, as it explains the cause and effect of events. The
divine plan is well-arranged. It is timed with amazing precision.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some say that astrology is an art. Some
others reject it as an idle dream or an illusion. Still, others may speak of
astrology as though it were an altogether contemptible superstition. They
contemplate with pity those who believe it. Some of those who have no
disappointment or other difficulties in life take pride in saying that they
have no faith in astrology and ridicule both the astrologer and the science.
Probably they may fear that they may lose their self-importance if they were to
recognize astrology. A few others say, under wrong impression or with
prejudiced ideas, that astrology is not a science. These people would not have
mastered the data on which correct predictions are based. This science explains
clearly that such opponents of astrology will have in their horoscopes evil
aspects between Mars and Uranus or between Mars and Mercury. These planets,
when afflicted, do not give quick grasp of this science, nor memory and
reproductive ability, and they produce people who are either ignorant, arrogant,
envious, or are always inclined to find fault with what they are not able to
understand.Pretending to know everything, they display their ignorance. The
antagonists often quote the opinions of such learned men, who do not want to
admit that it is a useful science. Learning is the mechanical acquirement of
facts and gaining knowledge in any subject. But wisdom is not so. Astrology can
be correctly interpreted only by a genius endowed with divine grace and no one
can call himself wise, without knowing astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I submit that astrology is a science and
that it can render very useful service to one and all and create faith even in
the sceptic, if one studies this book. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A knowledge about the history of astrology
and the illustrious and eminent sages and savants who practiced astrology would
give a better appreciation of the science itself.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="01.2_About the author by various people.html">← About the author by various people</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_01.3_ASTROLOGY_AN OCCULT SCIENCE">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="01.4_HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY.html">HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY →</a></div></body>
