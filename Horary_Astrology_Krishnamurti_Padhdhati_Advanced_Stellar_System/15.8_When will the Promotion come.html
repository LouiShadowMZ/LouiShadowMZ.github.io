according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, a planet will give the results of the lord
of the constellation in which it is situated and if the lord of the
constellation is retrograde then the matter will fall through. It will appear
as though it will happen but it will not fructify. Here the lord of the
constellation in which Mercury is deposited is Sun Sun can never be retrograde
in motion. Sun is represented by the node Kethu as Kethu is deposited in Leo
owned by Sun. As Kethu is conjoined with Venus, it will give the 6th house
results also as Venus is in 6 in its own constellation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore at the time Budha transits the
11th cusp the good news will be heard, and when Sun transits 13 degrees of
Capricorn the order of promotion will be received and you will take charge on
the 28th January, 1970. The day will be Wednesday and the star will be Hastha.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets at the moment of
judgment are Mercury and Moon. Moon rules the day and the sign where Moon is
transitting now. Mercury is the lord of the star where Moon is now. According
to Dasa and Bhukti, it will be Mercury Dasa Mercury Bhukti Mars Anthra Jupiter
Shookshma. Mars is lord of 2 and significator of 2 as there is no planet in its
star; Mars is in the constellation of Venus in 6 and sub of Sun, owner and
depositor of 6. Hence 28th January, 1970 must offer you the desired promotion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="15.7_Higher Status Any_ When.html">← Higher Status Any_ When</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_15.8_When will the Promotion come">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="15.9_Seniority in Service_ Will I have Justice.html">Seniority in Service_ Will I have Justice →</a></div></body>
