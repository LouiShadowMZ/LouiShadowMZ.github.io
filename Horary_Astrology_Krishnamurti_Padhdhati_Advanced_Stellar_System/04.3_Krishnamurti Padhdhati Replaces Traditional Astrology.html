practised by many astrologers, who followed either the traditional Hindu System
or the Western System. Honestly both of them find it difficult to pinpoint the
nature of the event and the time of event. The latter is more important to the
consultants.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of event must be found out to the
minute. Such a method alone is useful. With all humility, let me say that Lord
Ganesh has given through me a particular technic to decide the event. It is
popularly known as KRISHNAMURTI PADH- DHATI.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All the creations of God must die either in
the intrauterine life or born dead, or in the infancy or in the youth or in the
old age. Death is a certainty: it is inevitable: at which time it comes, none
knows. Pages after pages one may write, methods after methods, one can publish:
symposium after symposium one can collect; but people with open mind will say
that nothing serves useful purpose.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let them follow K.P.; they will say after
thoroughly understanding the subject, explained in a very simple way. applying
strictly Krishnamurti's method as instructed by him, casting the horoscope
using KRISHNAMURTI EPHEMERIS, KRISHNAMURTI AYANAMSA, and RAPHAEL'S TABLE OF
HOUSES, and also the HORARY SYSTEM-KRISHNA-MURTI PADHDHATI-one can confirm the
date and the time and declare the result which will prove to be correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">99% of the people get married. Which is
important? To give the date of marriage; if fate is to suffer, then to give the
date of divorce: if luck is there, to give the date of birth of children, etc.
Is it not?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A few percentage of the people alone own
houses, so many have to live in rented buildings or in Government quarters, or
in office accommodations. As most of them do not own, will they have any of
their own at all; if so, when they can have, is to be clearly and correctly
predicted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Nowadays most of the students and those
employed, desire to know whether they would get scholarship to go overseas, and
persecute higher studies. Actually this question was not tackled by our
ancients. K.P. alone is useful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When the old scholars expounded the theory
of Astrology, they were living in a land when Pakistan and India was one. They
said that Capricorn represented India. They have not given separately which
sign will represent Pakistan: therefore the difficulty arises for a student to
know whether Capricorn indicates Pakistan or India. But if one follows the
Horary System of Astrology-KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI-he need not pose such a
problem. Horary answers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus there are hundreds of problems for
which we have to guess if we follow only the traditional system. But K. P.
deals with each problem, gives most satisfactory and scientific explanation,
calculating on simple and single method and it offers straight answer, solving
the problem. K. P. can be followed by even a layman not knowing, previously,
anything about astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="04.2_HINDUS-UNSCIENTIFIC KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI-SCIENTIFIC.html">← HINDUS-UNSCIENTIFIC KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI-SCIENTIFIC</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_04.3_Krishnamurti Padhdhati Replaces Traditional Astrology">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="04.4_ZODIAC.html">ZODIAC →</a></div></body>
