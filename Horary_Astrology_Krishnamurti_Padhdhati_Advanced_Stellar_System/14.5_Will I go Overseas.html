find out significators for going overseas; and the sub lord of the 12th cusp is
to be judged to find out whether you will go at all to a foreign land. The 12th
cusp falls in Sun's star and Venus sub; Venus is in the constellation or Sun,
sub of Moon; both Sun and Moon are in the 12th house; Venus is to give the
results of the lord of the constellation Chandra which is in 12. Hence both the
lord of constellation and also the lord of the sub are connected with 12th
house. Hence life in a foreign place is sure; you must go.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards the significators of 3, 9 and
12, the 3rd house is occupied by Mars. 9th house is unoccupied and 12th house
is occupied by Moon, Jupiter and Sun; when you find out the significators, it
will be seen that Sun is in the constellation of Mars and Rahu is in the
constellation of Jupiter and Jupiter is in the constellation of Moon; whereas,
Venus and Mercury are in the constellation of Sun. Thus majority of the planets
are connected with the 12th house indicating that you must go.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Then when?" is the next query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of the judgment, Moon Dasa
balance is 9 years, 7 months, 2 days. Now Moon Dasa Moon Bhukti is operating;
in that, you will get pass, visa, etc., during Moon Dasa Moon Bhukti, Mercury
Anthra, that is after 7th November, 1969 and before 22nd December, 1969; your
journey will be during Moon Dasa Moon Bhukti Kethu Anthra. Kethu is occupying
Sun's sign, Venus star; it is conjoined with Venus. Therefore, Kethu is
stronger than Venus and it has to give in its sub period, instead of Venus.
Therefore, Moon Dasa Moon Bhukti Kethu Anthra you must go. That is within 10th
January, 1970.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling planets: Today, it is Venus day,
Friday, Virgo sign is passed by Moon; it is owned by Mercury; star is governed
by Moon, and according to the horary horoscope also these three planets are the
strongest significators and so your going to foreign is certain. You will leave
Delhi on 28th December, 1969, early morning. It will be a Sunday and the star
also Aslesha ruled by Mercury in Moon sign. The lagna will fall in Purvashada
Nakshatra which will be at the time of Sun rise. According to transit, Sun will
be in Kethu star Mercury sub: Moon in Mercury star; and Kethu will be in Venus
star Sun sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus the two members which you have given,
