<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord of the third cusp is deposited in the constellation of a planet which is the
		significator of 6 and 11 then one will have success. But if the sub-lord of the 3rd cusp is deposited in the
		constellation of a planet who is the significator of the houses 5 and 12, one cannot have success.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_8">Negotiation Successful or not</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"When will the negotiation mature?"</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"What for?"</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Regarding my business. Why should you know this, Sir"</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"The houses which I have to take for judgment depends on the query. If it is for marriage, I have
		to consider 7th house other than 3 and 9: If it is for adoption of a child, 5th house, other than 3 and 9, if it
		is for business and take over an industry, you have to judge houses 10, 6, 3 and 9. When the significators
		promise and conjointly operate, then only you can take over; prior to that the negotiation will mature."
		"Alright: Please mention a number between 1 and 249".</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"63"</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"Good. 63 means that the Ascendant should be between 0° Cancer to 0° 33′20" Cancer. It is in
		Moon's sign, Jupiter star, Moon sub. Now I have to erect a horoscope for Calcutta latitude, presuming 0° Cancer
		Nirayana rises in the East.. Raphael Table of houses furnish Sayana position. Therefore, add Krishnamurti
		ayanamsa for the Nirayana position of the Ascendant obtained for Number 63=Cancer 0. Now the ayanamsa is 23°
		20′. So for Calcutta Latitude of 22° 33' refer the column in page 42, left hand corner at the top. You find that
		the position of other cusps are given for 23° 11' in the 18th. line. We want for 23° 20' i.e., 9' more. The
		ascendants moves 53 in about 4 minutes; for 8, one-sixth time is needed. The other cusps move by 1° in those 4
		minutes. Therefore one-sixth of the difference is 10. Add 10' to each cusp given. Then Sayana 2nd cusp will be
		18° 10; 3rd cusp 15°; 10' 10th cusp 17°; 10' 11th cusp 20° 10′; 12th cusp 23° 10′; Deducting ayanamsa to get
		Nirayana position 2nd cusp will be 24° 50' Cancer: 3rd cusp 21° 50' Leo: 4th, 23 50' Virgo; 5th, 26° 50' Libra
		6th 0° Sagittarius; 7th 0° Capricorn and so on.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">So, draw a map and then insert the position of planets for 6-30 A.M. I.S.T. on Sun- day 6-7-69
		(Here no latitude, по longitude need be taken).</p>

<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Will his negotiation be successful? Find out the sub-lord of the 3rd cusp. It is in Jupiter

<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"When?"</p>

<p class="block_4">9th house; Rahu and Moon in 9: Take both as none is in their star.</p>
<p class="block_4">10th house: Moon is in Saturn star; Saturn.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">As Saturn is one of the significators prefer the last date to take over, and the other previous

<p class="block_4">(a) Saturn Dasa Rahu Bhukti Sun Anthra Moon Shookshma 17-12-1969..</p>
<p class="block_4">(b) Saturn Rahu Sun, Rahu, 25-12-1969. </p>

<p class="block_4">Therefore, to agree, to pay advance, to register and to pay the full amount and to run the show

<p class="block_4">"You always talk about ruling planets. But you have not taken them"</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"I had in my mind while working. Alright what is today Sun: Who is the lord of the

		an Agent.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore Sun, Moon, Rahu and Saturn are the ruling planets. They are also the significators.
		Therefore the above dates must and must come correct.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334429">Interview</h2>
<p class="block_4">Interview means that two people have to meet and discuss. The consultant wishes to see the
		person. His desire is to be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore one should judge the houses 3 (for meeting, interview, discussion), the 3rd to the
		seventh i.c.. the 9th; and the 11th houses.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The sub-lord of the 11th if tenanted in a constellation the lord of which is in direct motion,
		sooner or later he will have the interview. But if the sub-lord of the 11th is deposited in the constellation of
		a planet in retrograde motion, he cannot have the interview.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If one takes the ruling planets and works out, the person is to wait till that position of the
		zodiac ascends in the east which is governed by the ruling planets deposited in the constellation of those in
		direct motion. But the interview will be denied if they are deposited in the constellation of those in
		retrograde motion.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Astrology being a divine science, invariably, in all cases both the methods will give the same
		answer. It is a wonderful science. All the scholars and students following K.P. will give the same answer, as
		mathematics. Simple and straightforward method producing the same results even though the astrologers are
		different. Only when there are thousands of slokas and each interprets as he wishes, each astrologer will vary
		and give different results and the consultant will be confused further.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334430">Is the report true or false?</h2>
<p class="block_4">One is to judge the third house for any information or correspondence or communication or report.
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">We have to find out the sub-lord of the third cusp; note in which constellation the sub-lord is
		deposited. If the lord of the constellation in which the sub-lord is deposited happen to be Saturn, the report
		is false; But if it is Mars then it is mischievous and false. If it is Jupiter, it is true; and if the lord
		happens to be any planet connected with Saturn in any manner, the report is false; but connected with Jupiter,
		the report will be correct. This is the way to find out whether a rumour is believable or not.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">According to the Western system, note what the matter is. Whom does it refer? Find out the house
		which signifies the matter or the person. If the lord of that house is in an angular sign or if it be aspected
		by benefics the report is true. If any planet is deposited in that house which signifies the matter and receives
		favourable aspect from benefics, the report is true. Otherwise it is false.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">On 30th July, 1969 I reached Delhi. To pay respects to me and also to ascertain whether the
		rumour which my friend heard was true or false my friend Rao came to my chambers. After enquiring about my
		welfare, he began to put the query in a polite way. I asked him to give a number. He said 21. Then I worked out

<p class="block_4">The third cusp is in 19 degrees 14 minutes. It means it is in Mercury sign Rahu star and Mars
		sub. The sub-lord of the third cusp, Mars is in Scorpio in 11 degrees 36 minutes i.e., in Saturn's
		constellations. Therefore I replied that this particular rumour was not correct. Since the sub- lord is Mars and
		is in the constellation of Saturn in 12 it should be a mischief of that friend and it is more to tempt you.
		Later my statement was found to be true. What the jealousy friend told was confirmed, to be false.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334431">Exchanging Commodities</h2>
<p class="block_4">"Shall I exchange my article profitably" is the question.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">It means you are doing transaction with another. Ascendant denotes you; whereas 7th house
		indicates the other person. Whether you will be benefited or not is to be judged from the houses 2, 6 and 11.
		But if the significators of the houses 5. 8. and 12 were to operate then that is the time when you have to lose
		by such an exchange. Therefore one is to find out which period you are running and if that period is governed by
		the significator of 2, 6 and 11, you will make money. But if the period is governed by the significators of 5, 8
		and 12. you must lose.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In Horary Astrology please note the sub of the 6th cusp. If the sub-lord of the 6th cusp is
		deposited in the constellation of a planet which is the significator of 6 or 11, you gain. But if it is the
		significator of 5 or 12, by so exchanging you must lose; the other person must gain.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Because, when you exchange the other person had to give you something. Whether the other person
		loses, or not should be first judged, so the above rule will reveal whether he will lose or gain. Similarly also
		you have a sub-lord of the 12th cusp. If the sub-lord of the 12th cusp is deposited in the constellation of the
		significators of 6 and 11, you gain. But if the sub-lord of the 12th is in the constellation of a planet,
		signifying 5 and 12, definitely you must incur loss.</p>
<h2 class="block_26" id="id_Toc184334432">Is Journalism good for me?</h2>
<p class="block_4">Third house represents Journalism. Jupiter and Mercury are the two planets which indicate
		Journalism.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">According to Westerners the good aspects between Moon. Mercury and Jupiter indicate that it is
		favourable for journalism. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Virgo and Pisces are said to be the signs favourable. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">According to KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI if one has the desire to become a Journalist and he puts the
		query, one has to judge whether the sub-lord of the 11th cusp (indicating his success) is deposited in the
		constellation of a planet which is the significator of the houses 3 and 9 and if the sub-lord is in any manner
		connected with Jupiter or Mercury or both. If the sub-lord happens to be Venus, one will be writing much about
		the marriage, sex, love affairs, Chemistry etc. But if is Jupiter, most sensible and useful articles will be
		written and the books published will be popular. Considering the natural quality of the planet one has to fix
		the subject of the book which one will write.</p>

<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The querist asked this question, gave the number 114 within 249.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The number given by querist shows his lagna. The query is about his third son. The first child is
		shown by the 5th house counted from lagna. Younger brother or sister is shown by the 3rd house. second child is
		therefore shown by 3rd to 5th, i.e. 7th from lagna and, similarly, the third is shown by 3rd to 7th, i.e. 9th
		from lagna. Therefore the lagna of the third child is the 9th house, i.e. Rishaba 11° 43'. </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The 4th house shows one's own house, landed property, estate, etc. The 11th house shows
		fulfilment of desire and the 12th shows investment. Therefore the houses to be judged for construction of a
		building are 4, 11 and 12.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If it is a house already constructed and is to be bought off straight, judge the houses 6 and 9
		also, Why? Because one who is seller is shown by the 7th house. The 6th is 12th to 7th and the 9th is 12th to
		4th counted from 7th house. Further the houses 9 and 3 indicate surrounding the premises by the previous party
		and entry in the new house by the purchaser.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">For the purchase of the plot of land the same rules do apply.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Whether one will be able to construct a house at all, is to be seen from the 4th cusp. So, judge
		whether the sub lord of the 4th cusp is either retrograde or deposited in the constellation whose lord is
		retrograde. If either is retrograde then one will not be able to construct a house. If the sub lord of the 4th
		cusp and the lord of the constellation in which it is deposited are in direct motion and if this sub lord is
		also a significator of either 4th or 11th or 12th house, then one will be able to construct a building.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The horary chart for the number 114 with the twelve cusps for Bombay and the planetary position
		at the time of judgment, i.e. at 1-40 P.M. I.S.T. on 27-7-1969 is given above.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">We have to judge the 4th house of the third child. The 4th from 9th is the 12th from querist's
		lagna. Therefore we have to judge the 12th cusp. It is 12° 43' in Simha, i.e, in Sun sign Kethu star and Mercury
		sub. The sub-lord Mercury is not retrograde. It is deposited in the constellation of Saturn who is also not
		retrograde. Saturn is deposited in 12th bhava, counted from the lagna of the third child. Therefore Mercury
		(posited in the constellation of Saturn) is also a significator of 12th house of the third child. Therefore the
		building will be constructed in the name of the third son.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">As the father and his third child want to live in the same house, the 4th cusp of father and that
		of the third son must be connected to each other. The 4th cusp from the querist's lagna is 11° 43' Dhanur, i.c.
		Jupiter sign Kethu star and Mercury sub. The 4th cusp from the third child is in Sun sign Kethu star and Mercury
		sub. Therefore the sub lord and the lord of the constellation of 4th cusp of both the father and the child are
		Mercury and Kethu respectively. Therefore their dwelling place will be same.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">As the sub-lord of 4th cusp from the querist's lagna is deposited in 11th bhava, the desire of
		the querist will be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Now let us find out the time of the event. The house is to be constructed for third child.
		Therefore houses 4, 11 and 12 from 9th are to be considered. They are 12th, 7th and 8th respectively, from the
		querist's lagna.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">12th house is occupied by Jupiter and Ketu, 7th by none and 8th by Saturn. Rahu is posited in the
		Jupiter star. Sun, Mars and Mercury are in Saturn star and none is in Kethu star.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">12th house is owned by Sun, 7th by Jupiter and 8th by Mars. Jupiter is already considered above.
		Kethu and Jupiter are deposited in Sun's stars and Venus is in Mars star.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore the significators are Rahu, Kethu, Jupiter, Sun, Mars, Mercury and Venus. Which of
		these significators are beneficial and which are just temptors is to be found out from the ruling planets at the
		moment of judgment.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Ruling planets: Today is Sunday ruled by Sun. The sign transitted by Moon is Dhanus owned by
		Jupiter. The star transitted by Moon is owned by Venus. The lagna is Tulam owned by Venus. As Kethu is conjoined
		with Jupiter and Rahu occupies Jupiter sign Pisces, take Rahu and Kethu also.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">One should not accept these ruling planets as it is. Check up whether any of them is posited
		either in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet. If there is any, reject it and accept the remaining.
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In the present case none of the ruling planets is deposited either in the constellation or sub of
		a retrograde planet. Therefore the beneficial ruling planets are Sun, Jupiter, Venus, Rahu and Kethu. They will
		give the result during their conjoined period.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Dasa: Venus Dasa balance is 16 years 9 months and 7 days. In this Rahu Bhukti will run from
		4-7-1973 to 4-7-1976, During this period you will finish construction of your house in the antras of either
		Jupiter or Kethu or Sun. Jupiter is a ruling planet. Not only this, it is also the constellation lord of the
		lagna at the moment of judgment. Further it is the lord of 11th house counted from the lagna of the third son.
		Therefore Jupiter Antra will give a finished house. This runs from 16-12-1973 to 10-5-1974.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Transit: We have now to see whether transit agrees during this period. Consider the transit of
		Sun. Sun transits Venus star in Jupiter sign Dhanus in December 1973. Therefore transit agrees during this
		period and so you will construct your building during this period.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">From which date the querist will start living in the new house? The present house of the native
		is shown by the 4th house. The 3rd house shows changing the present place of residence. Mars owns 3rd house.
		There is no planet in the 3rd bhava. Venus is in Mars star. Therefore Venus has to give 3rd house results also.
		Therefore you will change the present place of residence and start living in the new house when Sun transits
		Venus sub in Jupiter sign Venus star on 28-12-1973. 1974 is the most pleasant and prosperous New Year and on the
		New Year day, you will be in your own new house.</p>

<p class="block_4">Balance of Sun Dasa 5 years 5 months and 25 days.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Property is indicated by the 4th house, counted from lagna. The 3rd house is 12th to 4th house.
		One who purchases the property is shown by the 7th house. The houses 10 and 5 are respectively 4th (property)
		and 11th. (fulfilment of his desire) counted from 7th house. Therefore selling away property is shown by the
		houses 3, 5 and 10 counted from lagna of the consultant.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">You want to sell away your property. Anyone with whom you deal is shown by the 7th house. Whether
		he will be able to purchase your property or not is to be seen from the 4th cusp counted from 7th, i.c. 10th
		cusp counted from lagna. Judge whether the sublord of the 10th cusp is either retrograde or deposited in the
		constellation whose lord is retrograde. If the sub-lord is retrograde, wait. If the lord of constellation in
		which sub-lord is deposited, is retrograde, then you will not be able to sell the property. If they are in
		direct motion and if this sub- lord is also a significator of either 3rd or 10th house, then you can and will
		sell.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The 10th cusp is Tulam 11 6' i.e. in Venus sign Rahu star and Saturn sub. The sub-lord Saturn is
		not retrograde. It is deposited in the constellation of Venus who is also not retrograde. Venus is deposited in
		5th bhava. It owns the houses 5 and 10. There is no planet in the 10th bhava. Therefore the sub-lord of 10th
		cusp</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(i) is not retrograde,</p>
<p class="block_4">(ii) is deposited in the constellation whose lord is not retrograde, and</p>
<p class="block_4">(iii) is also the significator of houses 5 and 10. Therefore you will sell.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Houses 3, 5 and 10 are to be judged for selling and 3 and 12 for giving possession.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The rules applicable to sell land or building are the same. The 3rd house is unoccupied. Jupiter
		owns it. Rahu and Kethu represent Jupiter as Kethu is conjoined with it and Rahu occupies its sign Meena.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(This is how nodes represent the planets)</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore planets in the constellations of Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu will be strong significators
		of 3rd house. This does not mean that Rahu, Kethu and Jupiter cannot give 3rd house results. They can also give.
		But the planets in their stars are stronger to give the results. (Tenant stronger.) Sun and Rahu are in Jupiter
		star. Mercury is in Rahu star and none is in Kethu star. Therefore Sun, Rahu, Mercury, Jupiter and Kethu are the
		significators of 3rd house.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">5th house is occupied by Venus. No planet is in 10th bhava. Venus owns both 5th and 10th houses.
		Saturn is in the constellation of Venus. Therefore Saturn is a strong significator of both the houses 5 and 10.
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">12th house is unoccupied. Its owner is Jupiter. Therefore the planets Sun, Rahu, Mercury, Jupiter
		and Kethu are the significators of 12th house also.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Finally the significators of houses 3, 5 and 10 are Sun, Rahu, Mercury, Jupiter, Kethu and
		Saturn.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Sun Dasa balance is 5 years 5 months and 26 days. In this Rahu Bhukti operates between 29-12-1970
		and 23-1-1971. Both Sun and Rahu are significators. Yet, during this period, you will not be able to sell your
		property. Why? Because Saturn and Moon are together in one sign. Whenever Saturn and Moon are together in one
		sign, it is called Poonaraphoo". This implies that the event will materialise on subsequent attempts. That is
		why you will not be able to sell away your property during Sun Dasa Rahu Bhukti. In Sun Dasa Saturn Bhukti you
		will make frequent attempts to dispose. This period runs from 11-11-1971 to 23-10-1972 whenever Saturn is a
		significator.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">During this period you will enter into an agreement during Mercury Anthra between 5-1-1972 and
		23-2-1972 (Mercury is for agreement and also strong significator of 3rd house) and finally hand over the
		possession of your property in Kethu Anthra during 23-2-1972 and 13-3-1972.</p>
<p class="block_21">﻿</p>
<p class="block_4">It does not allow others to give; it drags on till its period or sub-period passes. In its
		sub-period and the sub sub-period of another significator, it offers desirable results. Saturn is a foolhardy
		mother-in-law, who was in the bath room. Some persons came for donation Son wanted to give Rs. 5- Daughter-
		in-law had the mind to add one more five. When the mother- in-law was informed. she ordered "Wait, where is the
		hurry?" Then she came out after bath, dress, make up etc., and gave Rs. 151. Thus Saturn will behave.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The exact dates will be found out from transit of Sun.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">(1) Date of agreement will be 20-1-1972 when Sun transits Saturn sign Sun star Mercury sub.</p>
<p class="block_4">(ii) Date of giving actual possession will be 11-3-1972 when Sun transits Saturn sign Jupiter
		star Kethu sub.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">To find out whether the property will be sold for good price or not we have to judge the dasa
		lord. It is Sun. It is deposited in the constellation of Jupiter, Jupiter is deposited in 8th bhava and owns
		12th. Therefore Sun is a significator of houses 8 and 12. Both the houses 8 and 12 are favourable to the
		purchaser and therefore purchaser gains.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">"So, I will lose in the transaction." As an astrologer, 1 do not want to say that you will lose.
		It is implied.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Astrologers generally are devotees of some God or Goddess. Vak Siddhi will be there. So mostly
		talk in the affirmative; let the negative be implied. If one asks. "Has the newspaperwala come" do not reply,
		"No" say, he is coming. If one asks whether you would be going to office on that day and if you are on leave,
		say I go only tomorrow". Do not reply No. If one wants to have change for a Hundred Rupee note and you do not
		have do not say "Sorry": Say "Shall I get you from my friend".</p>

<p class="block_"> </p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">It is necessary to find out whether it refers to vehicle or to any of the other matters.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Only Krishnamurti Padhdhati is useful to pinpoint. If the sub-lord of the 4th cusp in the Horary
		Chart is either Venus being the significator of 4 or if the sub-lord is deposited in the constellation of the
		significator of the 4th who has any connection with Venus, one will have either a vehicle or buy some furniture,
		(Venus, if not the significator of 4 it can't indicate though it is said to be the chief governor of vehicle.)
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Again to differentiate between these two, judge as follows: If the sub-lord or the lord of the
		constellation in which the sub-lord is deposited (being the significator of the 4th and also connected with
		Venus) were to be deposited in a movable sign, it shows vehicle.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">But if it is in a common sign, it may be vehicle or cradle-like furniture which can move to and
		fro.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">But if it is in a fixed sign, it is only furniture.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord of the 4th is Mars or if the sub-lord is deposited in a constellation who is the
		significator of the 4th and in any manner connected with Mars, it refers to land or building.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord is Moon or if the sub-lord is deposited in the constellation of a planet who is
		the significator of the 4th and is in any manner connected with Moon, the mother is indicated by the 4th.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If the sub-ford of the 4th cusp is Jupiter or Mercury, or if the sub-lord is in the constellation
		of the planet who is the significator of the 4th and is any manner connected with either Jupiter or Mercury or
		both, the matter refers to one's education.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord of the 4th cusp is Saturn or if the sub-lord is in the constellation of a planet
		which is the significator of the 4th and also connected with Saturn, it refers to mine, mine products,
		excavation, treasure etc.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Thus we have to differentiate.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Will the vehicle be 2 wheeled or 3 wheeled or 4 wheeled or multi, like train or 6 or 8 wheeled
		lorries etc., or to wheeled ship or the flying helicopter or plane may be the next question.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">1. If it is a bicycle, manual labour is needed. Hence Saturn will be connected with the
		significators indicating purchase of a vehicle.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">2. If it is a motor cycle, there is the machinery; petrol or oil is used. Hence the significator
		should be connected with Mars, Venus and Moon. Venus and Moon indicate petrol, Mars machinery.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">3. If it is 4 wheeled one, then also these three planets should be connected with those
		significators who promise the purchase of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">4. If the significator of the fourth house promising purchase of a vehicle is deposited in the
		sub, the lord of which is in any of the signs Gemini, Virgo, first half of Sagittarius or Aquarius, then it is
		two wheeled.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">5. If the significator indicating purchase of a vehicle and if it were to be in the sub, the lord
		of which is deposited in bestial or 4 legged sign, or its constellation lord, then it can be car and anything
		similar to it. Aries, Taurus, Leo, second half of Sagittarius and Capricorn are the bestial signs: 4 wheeled.
	</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">6. If the significator of the purchase of the car is connected with Saturn, it shows self-drive.
		If it is connected with Jupiter there is a driver appointed. If both Jupiter and Saturn are connected sometimes
		he himself will drive and sometimes the driver. If the significator of the fourth is also the significator of 2,
		6 and 10 he will buy one and drive for other's use like one's own taxi or private tourist car. If the
		significator is also connected with Rahu or Kethu and is also the significator of 10 then he uses the office
		car.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">7. If the significator is deposited in the sub of a planet who is the significator of the 4th
		house and it is in the constellation ruled by a planet, deposited in the watery sign, it may be a boat-hand
		driven, if Saturn is one of the planets or motor boat if Mars, Venus and Moon are connected. If only Mars and
		Moon are connected it should be driven on steam when it will be a ship. Saturn shows submarine. If the
		significator of the 4th house is very strong and it is deposited in the sub of a planet deposited in the
		constellation of one occupying airy sign, one will buy aeroplane or helicopter. This significator should be
		connected with Mars, Venus and Moon.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Thus if one calmly studied, he can find out the difference. One can have many if Mercury and duel
		sign are connected with the significators.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Number given is 217. The horoscope is as follows.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The 4th cusp is Rishaba 20° 30' i.c. in Venus sign Moon star and Venus sub. The sub-lord Venus is
		deposited in the second half of Dhanus. Dhanus is a common sign and its second half falls in a bestial or four
		legged sign. Further Mars aspects Venus by its 4th aspect. Therefore you will have a four-wheeled vehicle.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_21">﻿</p>
<p class="block_4">The next step is to find out significators of 4, 9, 10 and 11. The significators of all the

		them is a ruling planet. Next comes Venus Dasa. (Venus is the strongest in the ruling planets, as it is the lord
		of the lagna. In ruling planets, always the lord of lagna is stronger than the lord of the star, the lord of
		star is stronger than the lord of Moon sign and the lord of Moon sign is stronger than the lord of the day.)
		Venus Dasa Venus bhukti runs between 8-8-1971 and 8-12-1974. In this you will get vehicle either in Mars Anthra
		or in Kethu Anthra. Mars is the lord of Moon sign in the ruling planets. But Kethu is the lord of the
		constellation. So Kethu is stronger than Mars and therefore Kethu Anthra will give you car. It runs between
		28-9-1974 and 8-12-1974.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">To find out the exact date of purchase of car consider the transit of Sun. Sun transits Venus
		sign Mars star Kethu sub on 18-10-1974. Therefore you must have the vehicle on this date only (Never earlier-nor
		later).</p>

<p class="block_4">Purchase of a vehicle is to be judged from the houses 4, 9, 10 and 11. because 4th house shows
		vehicle, houses 9 and 10 show enjoyment in this birth due to meritorious deeds done in the previous birth and
		the 11th house indicates fulfilment of one's desire.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The number given by the consultant denotes his lagna. Anybody with whom he transacts is shown by
		the the 7th house. If the consultant wants to sell his car, the 7th house shows the purchaser. Houses 4, 9, 10
		and 11 counted from the 7th house are 10, 3, 4 and 5. Therefore the houses to be judged for disposal of vehicle
		are 3, 4, 5 and 10. Sale offa car by one means its purchase and possession by another.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">To find out the time of disposal of the vehicle, one should work out the significators of the
		houses 3, 4, 5 and 10, find out the ruling planeets at the moment of judgment, take out the common planets
		between the significators and the ruling planets and then calculate the dasa bhukti period of these common
		planets and finally pinpoint the exact date and time by transit.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The significators of the houses 3, 4, 5 and 10 are Moon. Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu, Kethu, Mars,
		Mercury, Venus; so all the nine planets signify.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">To-day is Saturday ruled by Saturn. The sign transited by Moon is Rishaba owned by Venus. The
		constellation transited by Moon is Krittika ruled by Sun and the lagna is Tulam ruled by Venus. Venus has come
		twice in the ruling planets, once as lord of Moon sign and once as lord of lagna. Not only that, the number
		given by him also falls in Rishaba. So Venus is a very strong ruling planet. Why should the consultant come
		to-day to put his query when Venus is so strongly signifying? This is because his query is about vehicle and
		Venus governs Vahana. (It may be to buy or sell). So he comes when Venus is strongly signifying.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Rahu is conjoined with Venus in Meena and Kethu is aspected by Venus by its 7th aspect. Therefore
		Rahu and Kethu will also give the results of Venus. (Node first gives the results of the planet or planets with
		which it is conjoined, then the results of the planet in whose constellation it is deposited, then of the
		planets aspecting it and lastly of the planet in whose star and sign it is deposited.)</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Therefore the ruling planets are Saturn, Venus, Sun, Rahu and Kethu.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Of these ruling planets, see if any one is deposited either in the constellation or sub of a
		retrograde planet. If there is any. then reject it and take the remaining as the ruling planets.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">None of the ruling planets is deposited either in the constellation or sub of a retrograde
		planet. So all are to be taken. Venus is by itself retrograde. But this does not prevent it from giving results
		all throughout. However, it cannot give as long as it is retrograde. Once it becomes direct it will give,</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Now check up how many of the ruling planets are also the significators of the houses 3, 4, 5 and
		10. All the ruling planets are significators. Therefore you will sell your vehicle during their conjoined
		period.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">According to dasa-bhukti, Sun's dasa balance is 0 years 8 months and 11 days from 19-4-1969. In
		Sun Dasa, Venus Bhukti is already on. Venus is retrograde at present. As Venus will give results only after it
		becomes direct. Find out when it becomes direct. It becomes direct on 30-4-1969. (So we have to consider the
		period only after this date.) Rahu Anthra will commence on 9-5-1969 and will run upto 3-7-1979. Venus is very
		strong ruling planet and Rahu conjoined with it is still stronger to give results. So in Rahu Antrha you will
		sell your vehicle.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_18"><span class="text_2">﻿</span><span class="text_3">Moon is the only significator of 3rd house.
			Third house is 12th to 4th. So in Moon Shookshama, on a Moon star day the car will be sold and handed over
			to the purchaser. Moon shookshma runs between 21-6-1969 and 30-6-1969. On 23-6-1969 Moon transits its own
			star Hasta. The day is Monday ruled by Moon. The exact time of handing over the vehicle to the purchaser on
			23-6-1969 will be 3:30 P.M. when the lagna is 18° Tulam, ie. Venus sign, Rahu star and Sun sub. (Need not be

<p class="block_4">Balance of Kethu Dasa 6 years 3 months and 18 days.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In cases of competitive examination the points to be seen are:</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">1. Whether he has the necessary courage to compete? </p>
<p class="block_4">2. Whether he will be able to appear? and</p>
<p class="block_4">3. Whether he comes out successful?</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Whether one has the courage to compete is to be judged from the 3rd house. If the sub lord of the
		3rd cusp is Moon, one tries to adjust himself in the present circumstances and does not take bold decisions. If
		it is Saturn one will be very cautious and lacks in confidence. If Mercury, the native will be in two minds.
		Planets Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Venus as the sub-lord of 3rd cusp, however, give courage and confidence to
		compete.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">In your case, the 3rd cusp falls in Kumbha 9° 46' i.e., Saturn sign Rahu star and Jupiter sub. As
		the sub lord of 3rd is Jupiter, it will give you courage and confidence to appear for the examination.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Whether one will be able to appear for the examination or not is to be seen from the horary
		lagna. One may have courage to compete but may not be able to appear for the examination because of certain
		unavoidable difficulties or obstacles like illness, etc. at the time of competitive examination. If the horary
		lagna is spoiled due to the deposition of natural malefics or lord of 6 or 8 or 12, the native will not be able
		to make an attempt. If, however, the lagna is not spoiled, the native will be able to act as he likes.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The horary lagna in the present case is Dhanus, owned by Jupiter. No natural malefic is deposited
		in lagna bhava. Lagnesha is a natural benefic. Therefore you will sit for the</p>
<p class="block_4">examination.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">For competitive examination the houses to be judged are 4, 9 and 11. A doubt may arise in
		somebody's mind as to which houses be judged for second or third or fourth attempt. The answer is that whether
		one is appearing for the first attempt or the second or the third, even we have to judge the houses 4, 9 and 11.
		(For child birth me see the 5th house for the first conception, 7th house-being the 3rd counted form 5th-for the
		second conception, 9th house for the 3rd issue and so on. But in case of examination one should not see, which
		house for the first attempt, which for the second and so on.)</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Whether one will be successful in the competitive examination or not is to be decided from the
		planets whose conjoined period he is running at the time of examination. At that time if the dasa, bhukti and
		antra period governing planets are significators of houses 4, 9 and 11, you will come out successful. If not,
		you will fail. When significators conjointly operate then only one will get. Otherwise not.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">You are appearing for the competitive examination in the month of September 1969. At that time,
		according to dasa-bhukti, you will be running Kethu Dasa Venus Bhukti and Mars anthra. Kethu is in 9th bhava in
		the constellation of Sun who is deposited in 8th bhava and owns 9th house. Therefore Kethu is to give results of
		both 8th and 9th bhava.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">When will Kethu give 8th house results and when it will give 9th house results is to be decided
		from the results the bhukti and anthra lords have to give. If both the bhukti and anthra lords are to give the
		results of either 4th or 9th or 11th house, the dasa lord Ketu will give 9th house results. If either the bhukti
		or anthra lord is non-co-operative i.e. if it is not a significator of 4th or 9th or 11th house, then Kethu will
		also turn non-co-operative and give 8th house results.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">The bhukti lord Venus is deposited in the constellation of Rahu who is in 3rd bhava. Rahu
		represents Saturn as it is deposited in the sign Kumbha. Rahu also represents Moon and Mercury because they
		aspect Rahu. So Venus will give the results of ownership and deposition of Saturn, Mercury and Moon also. Saturn
		is deposited in 5th and owns 2nd &amp; 3rd. Moon is deposited in 8th and owns 8th. Mercury is deposited in 9th
		and owns 7th and 10th. Therefore Venus has, along with other portfolios, the 9th house portfolio also. Therefore
		Venus will co-operate with Kethu to give 9th house results if the anthra lord is a significator of either 4th or
		9th or 11th house.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Now let us see whether the anthra lord Mars co-operates. If Mars co-operates, you will come out
		successful. If it is non-co-operative, you will fail.</p>
<p class="block_13"> </p>
<p class="block_4">Mars is in the constellation of Saturn. Saturn is in 5th and owns 2nd &amp; 3rd houses. Mars by
		itself is in 12th bhava and owns 5th and 12th houses. Therefore Mars is in no way to give results of any of the
		houses 4, 9 and 11 and hence you will be invited to sit for subsequent examination. On this occasion, your
		colleagues will pass.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334439">Any Treasure in my Building?</h2>
<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord of the 4th cusp is deposited in a constellation. lord of which is the
		significator of the houses 2 or 11 or 6 one will surely have the treasure. Further the lord of the constellation
		should have any connection with Saturn in direct motion. According to traditional astrology if lord of 2 were to
		be in the 8th house, one can come by treasure or if lords of 2, 4, 9 and 11 conjoin, one have treasure. But in
		Horary astrology it is the sub-lord of the 4th house which will give a correct picture, when the question
		relates to Treasure.</p>
<h2 class="block_12" id="id_Toc184334440">Will I get Admission in the College?</h2>
<p class="block_4">The 4th house indicates the educational institution and since his desire is to get admission, the
		11th shows realisation of one's ambition. Therefore, sub-lord of the 4th is to be deposited in the
		constellation, the lord of which is the significator of 4 and 11.</p>
