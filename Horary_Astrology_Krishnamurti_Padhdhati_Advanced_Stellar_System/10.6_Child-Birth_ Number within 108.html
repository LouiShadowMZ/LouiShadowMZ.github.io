</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Fortunately, the number 28 within 108 given
by the person shows that the lagna is Cancer- Kataka-between 0' and 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20'.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The lagna, the aspects to the lagna, the
disposition of the lord of the lagna, and the various connections which it has,
indicate whether one's desire will be fulfilled To not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The position of Moon called Mathi, the
mind, shows the nature of the query. What he has in mind, as the urge to put a
question is given by Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lagna is Cancer-Kataka. It is governed by
Moon. Lagna gains strength as it is directly aspected by Moon. (A sign gains
strength if it receives aspect from its lord or if it is occupied by him.) so
Lagna is strong.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lagna is not occupied by malefics. Nor it
is aspected by evil planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, what you want to have, you will
surely have.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon, the planet indicating the query is in
the sign Capricorn ruled by Saturn, in the star governed by Sun-Uthrashada, and
in the sub of Jupiter..</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As per stellar astrology, Moon in Sun's
constellation indicates the matter signified by Sun who owns the second house.
The second house denotes Family and Finance."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Most of the people are worried about
"Family and Finance". So, Moon in Sun's star does not specifically
mention the nature of the query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now study the sub and also Sun. As Moon was
in 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 45", it is in Sun's star Uthrashada and in
the sub of Jupiter. Jupiter is the chief governor for children and money.
Again, to climinate either and for clarification to select the exact nature of
the query, furthermore one is to study.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Take Sun, the lord of the constellation. It
is in the constellation of Kethu who occupies the 5th house which governs the
birth of a child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Consider Jupiter who is the lord of the
sub. It is in the 11th bhava, in the constellation of Sun. Jupiter is strong to
indicate children, 11th house is the fifth from the seventh.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the query is about
"child-birth."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First of all, one is to find out the evil
influences and ascertain its magnitude. Then only, one is to consider the
favourable aspects promising an affirmative answer..</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Houses 6, 8 and 12 occupied by malefics,
threaten loss, difficulty, delay or denial. 6th house is vacant; 8th house is
occupied by Saturn which is in Jupiter's constellation and thereby its evil
results are initigated by Jupiter. Hence it will be a delaying planet and not a
denying one, 12th house is unoccupied.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence there will be much delay in becoming
the father of a child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You have asked me to suggest as to what you
should be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Answer: You have to perform
"shanthi." You have mentioned that you pray for Lord Ganesh. It is
correct, because' the 5th house indicates the initiation of the Mantra, Upasana
etc. Kethu is in the 5th house. It is aspected by Mars, the lord of 5, Jupiter,
the religious planet ruling the 9th house and the planet Saturn throwing
obstacles, Mars and Kethu, having connection with the 5th house indicate that
you are a devotee of Lord Ganesh.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whenever Jupiter aspects either the
Ascendant or the Moon in a horoscope, the person will have faith and knowingly
or unknowingly will be doing meritorious deeds: he may also pray or do
"Shanti". In the Horary chart, Jupiter aspects Moon, who is also the
lord of lagna and hence you will follow the advice to enjoy the beneficial
results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The query is about child birth. Houses 2, 5
and 11 are to be considered. The strength of the planets which signify those
matters of the houses 2, 5 and 11 is to be taken in the following order:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) The planets in the constellation of the
occupants of the houses, 2, 5 or 11;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) the occupants of the houses 2, 5 and
11;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) the planets in the constellation of the
lords of these houses 2 or 5 or 11:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d)the lords of these houses;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) those which are conjoined with these
significators; or </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) those receiving aspects from the
indicators. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">House 2 is occupied by Mars. Its stars are
Mrigasirisha, Chitra and Dhanishta. No planet is found in any of the three
asterisms.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">House 5 is occupied by Kethu. It rules over
the constellation Asvini, Makham and Moolam.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun and Venus are in Aswini star. No planet
occupies either Makham or Moolam. Hence Sun and Venus are strong significators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">House 11 is occupied by Jupiter and Rahu;
Jupiter's stars are Punarvasu, Visakha and Poorvapathra. No planet is in
Punarvasu, Neptune to which no dasa is allotted, is in Visakha, Reject it.
Saturn is in Poorvapathra.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu governs the three stars Arudhra,
Swathi and Sathabhisha. No planet is in these constellations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore Sun, Venus and lastly Saturn are
the significators. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To confirm whether they are the real
significators, consider ruling planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Today is Friday. Venus rules over Friday
(23-4-1965). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The constellation in which Moon transits is
Uthrashada - its lord is Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which is the sign in which Moon is passing
at the time of answering the query? Capricorn-Makaram. Who rules the sign,
Capricorn? Saturn owns it. Hence this moment is ruled by Venus, the lord of the
day, Sun, the ruler of the star Uthrashada and Saturn the owner of Capricorn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, when will a child be born?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As Saturn is in the 8th house, it delays.
Venus, the lord of 11, will give the child in its Bhukti-Apakara sub period.
The dasa lord will be Sun. Sun Dasa, Venus Bhukti, Saturn Anthra will be the
time of the birth of the child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">How to find out? At the time of answering
the Moon was in Uthrashada star, governed by Sun. It was in 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 45'. Therefore balance of Sun Dasa was 3 years, 3 months and 3
days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun Dasa, Venus Bhukti will commence on
26-7-1967. It runs for one year. The anthra of Saturn will be operating between
17-3-68 and 14-5-68.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore you can except a child on a
Karthika Nakshatra day between 17-3-68 and 14-5-68.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now, let us take the Western System, and
find out how it coincides-Father, how that system also gives the same time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon, by progression, in 3 years forms
sextile aspect with the lords of 2 and 11, i.e., Sun and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun, by progression, as lord of 2, conjoins
Venus-Sukra, the lord of 11 in 3 years from now onwards.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence, it is certain that you must have a
child, mostly on a Karthika nakshathra day in the end of April 1968 when Moon
transits the position of Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You mentioned that you have the idol of
Lord Ganesh, in silver. For your information, let the following details be
given.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"If one is afraid of one's longevity,
have an idol made of wood or clay and pray. It bestows long life. Also, people
desiring to have much of prosperity can have it in sandalwood. For victory over
enemies, idol in clay or sandlwood or Swetha Arka is the best. An idol made of
coral gives success in competition, authority power and health. Generally, rich
people do not maintain good health. An idol made of gold possessed by them,
will offer good health. Those who suffer from chronic disease may have the
figure of the lord in the ring or pendant, for speedy recovery from the disease
and to maintain good health in the future. If silver is used to make the idol,
it gives name, fame, reputation etc. If the idol is made of copper, one will
have chil- dren. If the idol is prepared in stone, will be lucky to have much
of landed property.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But one should handle the idol carefully
and keep it safely. If the image is hurt, it is an ill omen. It affects the
head man of the family. If any hole forms on the idol, there will be disease,
trouble etc. However costly it may be to the temple authorities to be kept in
the temple.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, buy Lord Ganesh made of copper
and pray him. "Prayers" during night hours will never go in vain as
there will be less of disturbance and you can concentrate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lord Ganesh made of copper gives enthusiasm
and encouragement. Ganesh will bless you with a child.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">people desirous of enjoying all the fruits
of life, make the idol in an alloy of gold, silver, copper etc.,
"Panchaloka".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether you pray or not, the chart shows
that exactly in 3 years, you will have a child and thus become the father.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="10.5_Any Child for me_ Who is Sterile.html">← Any Child for me_ Who is Sterile</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_10.6_Child-Birth_ Number within 108">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="10.7_Any Child at All.html">Any Child at All →</a></div></body>
