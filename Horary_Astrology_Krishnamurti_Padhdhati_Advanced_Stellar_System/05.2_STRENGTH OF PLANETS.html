<body><h2 id="heading_05.2_STRENGTH OF PLANETS_0"><span lang="EN-US">STRENGTH OF PLANETS</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Western: Westerners consider that a planet
situated in its own sign is the strongest. The signs are in Sayana system. Next
in strength is the essential dignity i.c., exaltation. According to them Sun in
19 deg. in Aries, Moon in 3rd deg. Taurus, Mars in 28 Capricorn, Mercury in 15
in Virgo, Jupiter in 15 in Cancer, Venus in 27 in Pisces Saturn in 21 in Libra
and Rahu in the 3rd in Gemini and Kethu in the 3rd degree in Sagittarius. What
we call as debilitation or neecha, they call as FALL and hence these planets
are debilitated in the opposite signs of their exaltation ones. They consider
that a planet is very powerful in the elevated position. Meridian is the most
elevated one. They term a planet in its own sign as Domal dignity. Detriment is
the term used when a planet is in a sign opposite to its own. They have nothing
as Moolatrikona, Shadbala, Ashtakavarga etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If a planet is dignified, it will manifest
good qualities whereas planets without dignity will manifest the lower side of
the nature. They give importance more to the aspect than these dignities.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hindu system: They have their method of
calculating the sixfold strength of a planet to ascertain whether it is strong
and do good to the native. They are Kalaja, Chesta, Uchchaja, Dik, Ayana and
Sthana. Also it is said that Moon, Mars and Venus are strong if the birth were
to be in the night hours; Mercury always; the other planets are strong if the
birth was in the day time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is said to be strong when it is full,
i.c., waxing Moon. Sun is strong when he is in Northern course; other planets
when they are retrograde.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun and Mars are strong in the tenth house.
Moon and Venus are strong in the 4th house. Mercury and Jupiter are strong in
the ascendant. Saturn strong in the 7th. Moon, Mercury and Saturn are strong in
the southern course and the others. in the northern course. A planet is strong
if it is retrograde or if it is full and not eclipsed, even though it is
debilitated or deposited in enemy's quarters. If a planet is eclipsed, it loses
all its strength, irrespective of it being exalted etc. Thus the Hindus have
various rules to calculate the strength of the planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hindus are of opinion that strong planets
will offer invariably advantageous results, whereas those who have little
strength will do harm. In practice, it is found to be ABSURD. Are there not
people born in Cancer Ascendant having Jupiter exalted in the ascendant
suffered during Jupiter Dasa? Are there not people born in Aries having Saturn
in 7 met with only difficulties, disgrace and disappointment? Therefore the
nature of the result need not be desirable simply because a planet is strong.
Further there are many other rules: amendments. An exalted planet if retrograde
it loses strength. An exalted planet if debilitated in Navamsa it loses
strength and vice versa. A debilitated planet if retrograde gains strength. If
debilitated in Rasi but exalted Navamsa it gains strength.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In K. P. no such confusion or thousands of
rules. Natal Horoscope:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In a Natal chart, do not worry whether a
planet is in direct motion or retrograde. There is no difference. Retrograde
planets neither loses strength nor they are harmful. If one takes the
horoscopes of those born in March, April and May, 1922, they had Rahu, Jupiter
and Saturn in Virgo. They were retrograde. People born in the stars of Venus,
Sun, Moon, Mars and Rahu had the dasas of Jupiter following Rahu and then
Saturn. They lived long. They had education, they had their marriage, birth of
children, purchase of car, house, etc. They enjoyed the fruits of life in this
world. Have the retrograde planets denied because they were retrograde. No. Not
at all. There is nothing as exaltation becoming auspicious and debilitation
inauspicious.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In K. P. (a) if a planet is exalted but is
in the constellation of a planet in debilitation, the extent to which it can do
either good or bad is limited. A container (the planet) may be big but the
content is a cheap affair (lord of the constellation is the content) like
cotton bundle. But a debilitated planet (small packet) in the constellation of
a planet in exaltation (costly gems) is similar to diamond in a small packet.
The lord of the constellation is to be considered as one representing the value
of the content. The container is the planet which is deposited in a
constellation.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.2_STRENGTH OF PLANETS_1"><span lang="EN-US">Retrograde-Horary chart</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Horary horoscope, planets in retrograde
motion, if deposited in the constellation of a planet which is in direct motion
indicates that after some obstacle and delay, the matter will materialise, when
it is indirect motion and passes beyond the point wherefrom retrograde motion
started,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But planets in retrograde if deposited in
the constellation of another retrograde planet or in its own when retrograde,
promises only failure. Never success.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Planets in direct motion if deposited in
the constellation of a retrograde planet, one cannot have success (For
retrograde motion take only Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn Rahu and
Kethu should not be considered as retrograde, as these two nodes never appear
to retrace the path travelled by them. When all planets, in direct motion moves
in one direction Rahu and Kethu move in the opposite direction. But they do not
take such a direction by which the Sun or Moon ever travel.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If one wants to know whether he could marry
a girl in view and if the sub-lord of the 7th cusp is in direct motion but the
lord of the constellation is retrograde he cannot marry her. It does not mean
that he will never marry. If one wants to know whether marriage is promised at
all and if the sub-lord of the 7th cusp is retrograde and it is deposited in
the constellation of a retrograde planet, he can never marry at all. If a
planet is the significator of 2 or 7 or 11 and it is deposited in the constellation
of a retrograde planet whether it is in direct motion or retrograde,that planet
cannot give marriage in its period or sub-period. His vote is invalid in the
election. If one wants to know whether he can divorce one; if the significator
of 1 or 6 or 10 were to be in the constellation of a planet in retrograde
motion he can't divorce her. If one courts imprisonment and if the significator
of the houses 3 and 12 are deposited in the constellation of a planet in
retrograde motion, he will not be arrested, in its period and sub-period. But
another significator of 3 and 12 whether it is retrograde or direct will give
him prison life in its period if this significator is in the constellation of a
planet in direct motion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If one wants to know whether he will win in
the races, or in the competition, or litigation or election, if the
significator of the houses 6 and 11 is deposited in the constellation of a
retrograde planet he cannot win in the period and sub-period of that planet:
but later when the significator of 6 and 11, in direct or retrograde motion
deposited in the constellation of one in direct motion, rules, during its
period and sub-period he will win.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.1_RULING PLANETS.html">← SECTION FIVE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_05.2_STRENGTH OF PLANETS">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="05.3_ECLIPSE ECLIPSED PLANET-RESULTS.html">ECLIPSE ECLIPSED PLANET-RESULTS →</a></div></body>
