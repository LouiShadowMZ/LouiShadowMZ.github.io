deposited in a constellation. lord of which is the significator of the houses 2
or 11 or 6 one will surely have the treasure. Further the lord of the
constellation should have any connection with Saturn in direct motion.
According to traditional astrology if lord of 2 were to be in the 8th house,
one can come by treasure or if lords of 2, 4, 9 and 11 conjoin, one have
treasure. But in Horary astrology it is the sub-lord of the 4th house which
will give a correct picture, when the question relates to Treasure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.5_Will I sit for Competitive Examination_ What is the
