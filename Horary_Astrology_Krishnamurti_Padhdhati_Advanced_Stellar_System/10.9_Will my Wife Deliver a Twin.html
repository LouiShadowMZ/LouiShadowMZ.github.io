deposited in the constellation of a planet which is either Mercury or which
occupies any of the dual signs, Gemini, Sagittarius or Pisces then one's wife
will deliver more than one at a time. Just like we see in the Horary Chart, it
is also advisable to look to the number of the conception which she has, and
then calculate, find out which house we have to judge. The cusp of that
particular house should be ruled by a planet, which is deposited in the
constellation of one who is either Mercury or who is deposited in one of the
three duel signs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="10.8_When Can I Deliver.html">← When Can I Deliver</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_10.9_Will my Wife Deliver a Twin">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="10.10_Am I Pregnant.html">Am I Pregnant →</a></div></body>
