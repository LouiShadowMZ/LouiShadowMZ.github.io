<body><h2 id="heading_13.7_Will I commit Murder_0"><span lang="EN-US">Will I commit Murder</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note the sub-lord of your Ascendant. The
lord of the sign, star and sub of the 7th cusp will be the ruling planets of
the person whom you want to murder (One should note that one may go to murder
one person but by mistake one may murder another). So it is important to note
the ruling planet of the opponent. The sign where the 7th cusp has fallen is to
be noted. Note whether this seventh sign is a movable one or fixed one or a
common one. Judge the Bhadhakasthana, Marakasthana and find out the significators.
If the sub-lord of your ascendant is deposited in the constellation of a planet
which is the significator of his Bhadhakasthana or Marakasthana and also the
significator of your second house then you will commit murder.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Readers should note that I carried out the
experiment with a friend of mine who is the owner of a few sheep. Whenever he
gave feast to his friends, he himself found pleasure in selecting a sheep and
slaughtering it himself. On 3 occasions I asked him to give a number within 249
before killing the animal and the above rule came very true. Only once he gave
me information that one more kid is added to his cattle. He gave the time of of
birth. I noted down the ruling planets of that sheep. It is God who controls
everything in which the number that the person gives is not excluded. When
after 4 years he wanted to kill it I asked him to give a number and the 7th
cusp in full agreed with the ruling planets at the moment of the birth of the
sheep.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These will appear to be funny.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I carried out experiments with the cows I
had to find out how far prenatal epoch works. I took my cows to the Veterinary
hospital, had them inoculated-inoculation and ejection for cows is only
once-noted the date of inoculation and the delivery of the calf. I found a lot
of disagreement. Later I collected data from maternity hospital and found that
the prenatal epoch is not reliable and helpful whereas it is useless in the
cases of those born within a period of one hour. Thus I have done experiments
which are rare but which open our eyes.</span></p><span lang="EN-US"><br clear="all"/>
