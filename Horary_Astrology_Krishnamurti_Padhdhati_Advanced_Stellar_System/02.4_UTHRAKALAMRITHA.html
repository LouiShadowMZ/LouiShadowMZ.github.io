and Horary chart.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 1: In the previous six chapters how
to predict the results for a person taking his birth horoscope is explained. If
no horoscope is available the results can be predicted by taking the time of
query. The results obtained by scrutinising the birth chart or the Horary chart
erected for the time of query will be the same. They will not differ. If at the
time of query it is cloudy and it is not possible to ascertain the exact time
which would have passed from sunrise then by putting further questions to the
querist, his horoscope can be erected. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(What the Consultant and Astrologer should
do.) </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 2: The consultant is advised to take
fruits and fees to the astrologer. If the querist is asked to give any number
between one and 108, he should give any one number. Then the astrologer takes
the number for further calculation and prediction whether the result is
favourable or not. The astrologer explains the past and future after he prays
to his diety. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(How to erect the horoscope of a person who
has lost it) </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 3: Divide by 9 the number given by
the consultant. Note down the quotient and the remainder. The former denotes
how many rasis (signs) from Aries (Mesha) has to be counted and the latter
indicates the exact Navamsa to be taken in the next sign. Work out the position
of the planet and note down the Bhavas for this horoscope; one has to predict
the results whether advantageous or not. One should consider the strength of
the planets and also to which matters each planet is the Chief Governor. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 4: Calculate the number of flowers
and the units of money given to the astrologer by the consultant. He is to
multiply this figure by the number given by the consultant, and then divide by
12. Note down the remainder. Jupiter will be deposited in the horoscope of the
consultant in that sign which is obtained by counting from Aries with the
remainder. Jupiter at the time of consultation will be in a sign. The
astrologer has to look at the consultant and Guess his age and calculate how
many times Jupiter would have completed the cycle of the zodiac. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note how far Jupiter has passed in the
sign, from the commencement of that sign at the consultation. So much will be
the number of months and days which would have passed from the previous
birthday of the consultant. Thus by noting the number of cycles made by the
Jupiter and also the proportionate movement of Jupiter in the sign at the time
of consultation you calculate the time passed after his birth. Or the sum is to
be deducted from the time of the query. The result is to be taken as the exact
time of the birth of the consultant. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 5: All the above calculations ars in
Solar System, i.e., the month, the day, the nazhikhai (ghatis!). (I Ghati = 24
minutes = 1 Nazhikhai). Having obtained the birth time one can calculate and
erect the complete horoscope, of the consultant who would have lost his. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 6: The consultant has given a number;
multiply it by 2 and then divide the product by three. The question will be
about a living object if the remainder is one. If the remainder is two, it will
be about some mineral; if the remainder is three or zero, then the question
would be about a plant. If at the time of question the sign Aries is the Lagna
it represents two- legged bipeds. If the lagna falls in Rishaba it represents
four- legged quadrupeds. If the Ascendant be Gemini it denotes pregnancy. Legal
dispute will be the matter if Cancer rises, Question will be about the
Government if Leo is the lagna. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 7: If the Ascendant falls in Virgo,
the question will be about the secret activities with a lady other than his own
wife. If Libra is the ascendant the question relates to one's business. It will
be about one's fear from enemies, if the ascendant is Scorpio. Sagittarius, as
ascendant indicates the loss of money. Capricorn denotes any undesirable action
of the consultant. Aquarius being the ascendant indicates one's rank position,
prestige, house or dwelling. Sages say that one should note whether the Rasi or
Navamsa is strong. Select the stronger of the two. They follow the above rules
to declare the result. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 8: (In this sloka the author gives
the various matters indicated by each planet.) </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) If Sun is deposited either in Rasi or
Navamsa in his own sign, at the time of the consultation, then the matter
relates to the king or the country. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) If in his own Rasi or Navamsa whichever
is stronger, Moon is situated, then it indicates lakes, etc. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Mars in his own Rasi or Navamsa denotes
fire, danger, accident or dispute. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Mercury similarly placed indicates
business or cultivation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) Jupiter shows that the question would
be about the consultant's benefactors or high officials or the ruler etc. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) Venus indicates about one's smooth run
of life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) Saturn portrays that the queries relate
to a person or a property. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 9: (Strength of the planets and the
extent of the result). Exalted planets give double the effect; planets in
debilitation produce no effect at all; planets in their friend's quarters give
only 50% of the result. If a planet is in a neutral house the effect is very
moderate. Suppose there are two planets in exaltation or they are in their own
signs, then select the stronger of the two and note to which matter the
stronger planet is the chief governor; also consider the house occupied by it. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 10: (Time of event). The matter will
be fulfilled immediately if the significator be exalted. If it is in his own
sign, in a few days, it will be realised. If it is in friend's quarters, it
takes a few months. If it is neither exalted nor in its own or friendly sign
one can realise only after some years; if a planet be in conjunction with or
aspected by an evil planet, then the consultant will be disappointed: there
will be only failure. If the lord of the ascendant is deposited in the house
which is to be judged for that query or if the lord of the ascendant is
aspected by strong benefics the native will have success, at once. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 11: (Direction allotted to each
sign): The zodiac is a circle of 360 degrees, and there are 12 signs of 30
degrees each also. The zodiac is divided into 108 Navamsas, these are all
fixed. Kalidas explains how each sign indicates a particular direction. This
does not agree with other authors</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 12 (Aruda Lagna): Suppose a person
with flowers and fruits approaches an astrologer and is in a place to put a
query, then one has to take the sign indicated by the direction in which he is
standing. That sign is called Aruda Lagna at the time of query. An Astrologer
should consider the owner of the Aruda Lagna and that particular house which
indicates the nature of the query. He should include, while judging the planets
conjoined or aspected by them. The astrologer has to predict such questions whether
it may be t desirable or not, </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Slokas 13, 14 and 15: Note down the gatikas
which have passed from the time of sunrise to the time of consultation.
Multiply the number of gatikas by nine. Then divide by 20. The quotient
indicates the position of Moon at that time. This Moon is called Sukshma Moon.
But the position of Moon for the moment of consultation according to ephemeris
is called Sthula Moon. The Navamsas of both the Sthula and Sukshma Moon is to
be found out. If the Sthula Moon receives aspect from the Sukshma Moon, Jupiter
and Mercury, then the consultant wants to know about an animal. But if Mars,
Rahu and Saturn aspect the Sthula Moon, the question would be about a mineral.
If Sun and Venus aspects the matter will refer to vegetable kingdom. Jupiter,
Venus and Rahu aspecting the Sthula Moon indicates many matters; if the Sthula
Moon occupies Gemini, Virgo or Libra Navamsa, the question is about two-legged
bipeds. If the Sthula Moon is in a watery sign which indicates multi-legged
creatures. If the Sthula Moon occupies Sagittarius and Aquarius Navamsa, the
question is about some of God without legs. If the Sthula Moon is in Aries,
Taurus or Capricorn the matter indicated is about four legged (quadrupeds) one
is to know in which portion of a rasi a planet is situated. Sign is to be divided
into three equal parts and the first part is called youth, the second Yauvana
and the third Vridha. These are the three conditions of a planet situated in a
sign. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 16: Signs from Aries are movable,
fixed and common. The movable signs Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn are
called Garba. The fixed ones are called devara and the common ones are called
Bahya. Garba and Devara indicate an object held in the right hand whereas Bahya
shows that in left hand. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 17: Thus one should guess a thing
kept close in the hand whether it is short or long, is to be judged from the
length of the rasi. (Signs are classified as short ascension and long
ascension). The shape, the colour of the material is to be judged for the
Navamsa sign. The nature of the cloud reveals whether the object is beneficial
or not. The place is to be judged from the sign whether it is on land or sky or
water or mountains. Also the sign indicates whether it is wicked or
uncontrolled for tamed or polite. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 18 (Time of accomplishment): The
consultant gives a number within 108; divide by 5. The quotient is to be added
to the number given. Divide the same by 60. In so many Ghatikas the matter will
be fulfilled. Divide by 30 you get so many thithis. Divide the sum by 7 it
indicates so many days after consultation. Divide by 12 this shows the number
of months; divide by 60 the remainder indicates the number of years. This
method is to be followed for all questions. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sloka 19: If the lord of the house which is
to be judged for a particular question and the lord of the lagna are benefic by
nature and also occupy good house mutually aspecting each other the matter will
be fulfilled satisfactorily.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="02.3_Prasna Gyana.html">← Prasna Gyana</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_02.4_UTHRAKALAMRITHA">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="02.5_SHATPANCHASIKA.html">SHATPANCHASIKA →</a></div></body>
