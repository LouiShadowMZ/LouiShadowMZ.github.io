fundamentals like the names of 12 signs; planets; the exaltation, debilitation;
etc. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to him, morning is indicated by
Jupiter and Mercury. Evening is indicated by Moon and Venus. The day, by Sun
and Mars whereas Rahu and Saturn denote the time of sunset. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter and Venus denote two-legged ones;
Sun and Mars represent four-legged one: Saturn and Mercury denote birds: Moon
and Rahu, the reptiles. Moon indicates large ones Venus flat one; Sun and Mars
square: Mercury and Jupiter round; Rahu and Saturn tall. (Hindu authors give
different versions.) </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars indicates red colour; Mercury green;
Jupiter golden; Moon handsome: Sun brilliant red: Venus white: Saturn and Rahu,
black.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury indicates child; Mars young man;
Moon and Venus adults; Sun, Jupiter, Saturn and Rahu indicates aged people. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then, he describes what the twelve houses
indicate. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He also gives the method, by which one has
to measure out the shadow and calculate the time of query. This is not at all
applicable to different latitudes, since in many latitudes, shadow is so long,
that it cannot be measured at all. And this method may be tried by people
living close to the Equator. Application of this rule is limited. Only day time
is to be preferred </span>——<span lang="EN-US"> Cloudy days are out of question.
When time-piece is available, there is no use for this method. Then, he gives
the method by which one is to find out whether the lagna is strong, and also
the bhava to be judged, is strong. It is general, and it can never come and it
will mostly fail. Then, he deals with eclipse planet. He claims that when lord
of lagna aspects the lagna which is to be judged, then the promotion of the
bhava of the success is to be predicted. This is also not correct. He gives his
opinion that if lord of lagna or lord of 11 is situated in the 11th house, one
will gain. Stellar Astrology disproves this rule. Again, his opinion about the
houses 6, 8 and 12 is not correct. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Stanza 87, he discusses whether one will
have safe deli- very or not. He says that if lord of 5 is deposited or is
aspecting the 5th, then the delivery is not easy: if an evil planet is in 5, or
aspects 5, one is to predict miscarriage. But, in practice, it was found that
lord 5 in 5, deposited in the constellation of lord of 8 in 8, has caused
cessarian operation. Constellation theory alone, will prove to be successful.
He says that twin birth is to be predicted, if 8 planets are deposited in 4
houses, 2 in each. Such a combination will be very rare. (So, research cannot
be successfully done in one's lifetime.) He says that the age of the
intra-uterine life of the Foetus is, as many number of months as the number of
houses, where Venus is situated from the lagna. Thus, he goes on dealing in his
book. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My opinion is that the whole thing is
general and is not at all helpful to exactly pin-point the nature of the event
and the time of the event. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As regards disease, he says Vayu: Pitha;
sleshma like that. All out of date-Anyhow, I have to say that it is not useful
for modern times. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><span lang="EN-US"><br clear="all"/>
