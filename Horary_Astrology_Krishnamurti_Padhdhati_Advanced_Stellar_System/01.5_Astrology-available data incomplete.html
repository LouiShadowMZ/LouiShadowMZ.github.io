be vastly supplemented. No one is in possession of all the findings of our
sages; nor are we blessed with such a Guru who can impart correct scientific
knowledge to us. Whatever we may have to day is only a part of what they have
left behind. A subject taught by a Professor will be complete. We are not
fortunate to I have such an advantage in our lifetime. So with what little
literature we possess, we have to understand the fundamental principles and
then, by regular and strenuous work, develop it. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="01.4_HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY.html">← HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_01.5_Astrology-available data incomplete">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="01.6_Astrology-its Use and Limitations.html">Astrology-its Use and Limitations →</a></div></body>
