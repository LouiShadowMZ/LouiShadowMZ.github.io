<body><h2 id="heading_11.5_Where is the thief_0"><span lang="EN-US">Where is the thief</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As Saturn indicates strongly the thief and
also Mars and as the houses occupied by them are 1 and 7 and they are in the
sub of the Sun and Mercury, who are in the 10th house, an angular house
(Kendra), he is in the same place. But if the significator would have been in
the sub of a planet occupying the house 3, he has gone to a place close by. If
the sub lord occupies the 9th house he has gone a long way off. If the
significator of the first house and that of the 7th house are in the same sub
lord then at the time of query the fellow who accompanied the person who has
lost, is the fellow who had taken it and knocked it away.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Such an indication I had when two people
came to my house at Madras and asked me about 15 years ago. I took the person
who complained to me that he had lost a buffalo inside my room saying
"Please come inside and pray to God Ganesh; you will get it." But
when he alone came inside. I told him that the fellow who has taken you to me
to consult, has got a hand in the theft. I asked him to keep quiet, be calm and
patient. Then I came out and took the other man saying "why you have not
come along with him. Come on, you also see the lord whom I got through the
blessings of His Holiness Kanchi Kama Koti Peetadhipathi Jagadguru Shri
Sankaracharya Swamigal" "Yes, Yes, I am coming," he said. Then
he came inside. I told him "Hullo! According to astrology and Nimitham I
had, I feel you were responsible for the theft of the buffalo. Tell me the
truth or I will predict in your presence that you are mainly responsible for
the loss of the buffalo. He said "Sir, the buffalo was grazing in my paddy
field and asked my tenant to drive it a few miles off and put it in the
Government Pound. I have not stolen. Alright, let us go, I said. Then we came
to the consulting chamber. I told him "You both go and search in the
Government pound. You will have your buffalo."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The readers will be surprised to know that
the animal was brought from the pound where the servant had left it and the
friend who brought the querist to me for consultation was the one responsible.
Thus the indications of the planets never, never fail. What is really lacking
is the basis behind the prediction of the planetary portents-there should be
only a single rule and not many, each contradicting the other. Astrology as a
science has so far been relegated to the back- ground due to long time, neglect
and discouragement to research. The only way astrology can be restored to its
original glory is to discard all the decrepit, doubtful theories which confuse
the consulted as much as the consultant and adopt correct methods evolved as a
result of thorough and constant research. Krishnamurti Padhdhati paves the way.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="11.4_Recovery of money lost.html">← Recovery of money lost</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_11.5_Where is the thief">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="11.6_Entangied Money.html">Entangied Money →</a></div></body>
