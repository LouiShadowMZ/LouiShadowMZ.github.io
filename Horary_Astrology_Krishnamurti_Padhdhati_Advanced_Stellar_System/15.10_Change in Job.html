date of birth to give and wishes his query to be answered on the basis of
Horary Astrology. Horary Astrology is helpful in prediction even when the birth
horoscope is available because, while the birth chart is likely to be incorrect
when worked out on the basis of incorrect birth times, the horary or prasna
chart is never so. Further the positions of the planets in the heavens at the
time an astrologer takes up the query for answer will bear a definite relation
to the query--the urge to answer is created in the astrologer's mind only at
such a time when there is an interrelation between the matter in question and
the heavenly positions of the planets. Horary Astrology reveals the answer
accurately and is quite scientific. Horary Astrology, in other words, is a
cross-verification of the results computed on the basis of the natal horoscope,
the dasa bhukti, etc., and will give the same answer as that obtained from a
reading of birth horoscope-in fact, much more accurately clearly and to the
point than the natal chart where one gets many alterations. Indeed, the horary
system is much more useful than the natal chart to find out answers to specific
questions. It should not be dismissed as one unworthy of use in the way a few
do. While our ancient seers who gave us the various slokas were possessed of
great intuition, they did not expect us to remain static and only remain
content quoting from their scriptures. Just as the swan when given milk
combined with water throws away the water and takes only the pure milk, we will
not be indulging in any wrong if we discard those methods which have failed us
in actual practice and take only those that have proved correct. Astrology has
been lying low all this time because no one took pains to develop the science
and develop it along scientific lines. No wonder that when a new, scientific
method of analysis is presented, there is great aversion in those circles
trading in the name of traditional astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Krishnamurti Padhdhati, for instance,
presents astrology in a new way stressing the effects based on constellations;
the constellations, in turn, are divided among the nine planets in the same
proportion as the years ruled by them in the Parasara's Dasa system of 120
years. Thus, when a native is born with Chandra at birth in Guru's
constellation Punavarvasu he is said to run the dasa of Guru and not of
Chandra, the effects will be what Guru has to offer and not what Chandra has to
offer. Krishnamurti Padhdhati is thus only a development of this aspect and a
corrective one; it is quite rational and scientific than all the available
systems of prediction and throws wide scope for study.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us now come back to the subject-matter
of the query which is about change in occupation of the querant. The number
mentioned by him is 144 (out of 249). The Zodiac of 12 signs and 27
constellations is further sub-divided, according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati,
into 249 sub-divisions, so much so any part of the zodiac will have three
planets ruling it, the sign or rasi lord, the constellation lord and the lord
of the sub- portion of the constellation. On this basis, the number 141
represents that area in the zodiac which lies between 28 degrees 46 minutes and
40 seconds in Thula (Libra) and 29 degrees 26 minutes and 40 seconds. As this
particular area commences at 28 degrees 46 minutes 40 seconds in Thula, this
will be the lagna for the query. The cusps of the other houses for the query
will be drawn by referring to the Table of Houses by Raphael for the latitude
of the place where the query answered. If 28 degrees 46 minutes 40 seconds in
Thula is to be the lagna according to the Nirayana of the Indian system, then
the Sayana position of the lagna will be 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 46'
40" added by the Ayanamsa, ie.,. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 21</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> for 1969, ie., 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6' 40" Vrischika
(Scorpio). A look at the Raphael's Table of House, page containing the table
for Latitude 28</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40' N which is the latitude of Delhi,
will show what the cusps of the other houses, namely, 10; 11, 12, 2 and 3 will
be according to the Sayana system when 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6' 40";
Scorpio (Vrischika) rises in the East. The positions of the cusps in Sayana
system so obtained will have to be deducted by the amount of Ayanamsa for the
year under reference so as to get the nirayana positions of the different
cusps. Thus, for the lagna 28</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 46' 40" we get the
other cusps of houses as follows:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">

whether it would prove fruitful or otherwise. The 2nd house of the horoscope
stands for financial gains; the 6th governs service and the 10th house
(Meridian) denotes occupation, trade, business, profession etc. In Hindu
Astrology, it is said that planets which are in 6, 8 and 12 to any house do not
contribute to the matters influenced by that house; similarly, the houses which
are in 6, 8 and 12 to any house are considered to negate the affairs influenced
by the house concerned. On that basis, houses 3, 5 and 9 respectively happen to
be in 6, 8 and 12 to the house of profession or occupation and consequently the
planets signifying these houses will contribute, in their conjoint period, to
change in profession, the native taking leave, etc. (The third house as we all
know rules short journeys or journeys to nearby places; the 5th house rules
pleasurable pursuits; and the ninth house represents journeys to far off places
and pilgri mage. If one really notes the periods he is running whenever he is
on leave temporary absence from official duties, he will find these periods
governed by the planets which are the significators of houses 3, 5 and 9.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us now work out the significators:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">
