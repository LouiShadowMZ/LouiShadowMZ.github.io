	<h2 id="id_Toc184334442" class="block_12">Will my Love Affairs Materialise ?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord of the 5th cusp is deposited in the constellation of a planet who is the
		significator of the houses 7 and 11 then materialisation of the love affairs is promised. But if the sub-lord of
		the 5th cusp happens to be in a constellation, the lord of which is the significator of the houses 6 or 12 then
		it will never materialise. If it is in the constellation of the significator of 6, the other party falls out.
		But if the sub-lord of the 5th is in the constellation of the planet signifying the 12th house then the
		consultant himself will drop the idea.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334443" class="block_12">Invalid Child —— will it pick up Health?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">If the consultant is the parent of the child take 5th cusp indicating the child. If the sub-lord
		of the 5th cusp is deposited in a constellation, the lord of which is the significator of the houses 3 and 5,
		the child will pick up. But if the sub-lord of the 5th cusp is situated in a constellation the lord of which is
		the significator of the 10th house, who is also connected with Saturn in any manner, shows that the child cannot
		recover health at all. It will be ever sickly."</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334444" class="block_12">Can I have a Partner in my Business?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord of the 8th cusp is situated in the constellation of a planet signifying houses 6
		and 11, you can have a partner. But if the sub-lord of the 8th cusp is deposited in a constellation, the lord of
		which is the significator of the houses 5 and 12, never have a partner.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334445" class="block_12">Can I Prosper as an Actress or an Actor?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">If the sublord of the 5th cusp is deposited in a constellation of a planet who is the
		significator of the houses 5, 6 and 10 one can be popular as an Actor. It is also the significator of 11, one
		will be prosperous. If Mars is one of the planets signifying these houses, he can be a leader among them. There
		is no inferiority complex. No stage fear, But Success alone.</p>

	<p class="block_4">The 5th cusp is very important to see whether one is capable of producing a child or not. The
		11th house is the 5th house of the partner. Therefore the 11th cusp shows whether the partner will be able to
		produce children or not. If the 5th cusp shows that he can and he will have children and the 11th shows that the
		partner cannot naturally, he will have children somewhere else. If the 11th cusp shows that the partner can
		produce and 5th cusp denotes that he cannot produce, then the wife will have natural children. If both the 5th
		cusp and the 11th cusp promise progeny then they will both have children. But the children born may or may not
		be due to the husband and the husband also can have children outside, other than what he can have through his
		wife. If both the 5th and 11th cusps are not favourable, they will both be sterile.</p>

			(because the number is given by the husband).</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 5th cusp is 20° 36' Aries, i. e. Mars sign, Venus star and Jupiter sub. Jupiter is neither
		retrograde or deposited in the constellation of a retrograde planet. But it is not a significator of any of the
		houses 2 or 5 or 11 (see table of significators). Therefore of the three essential conditions for the ability to
		produce children, the third condition is not satisfied. This clearly means that the husband is sterile.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now take the 11th cusp. It is Tulam 20° 36′ i.e. in Venus sign Jupiter star and Jupiter sub.
		Jupiter is neither retrograde nor deposited in a constellation whose lord is retrograde. Also Jupiter is a
		strong significator of 8th house which is the 2nd house counted from the lagna of the wife. Therefore the third
		condition is satisfied here and the wife will be able to produce children.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When she is productive and her husband is sterile, she will have natural children.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The houses 2, 5 and 11 counted from the lagna of wife are 5, 8 and 11. From the table of
		significators, the significators of theses houses are Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, Kethu and Venus.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Which of these significators will really give children and which are merely temptors is to be
		found out from the ruling planets. They are the lords of the day, rasi, star, lagna and lagna-star at the moment
		of judgment. The day is Sunday ruled by Sun. The sign and star transited by Moon are owned by Jupiter and
		Mercury respectively. The lagna is 22° Dhanus, i.e. Jupiter sign Venus star. As Kethu occupies Sun's sign, take
		Kethu also. Therefore the ruling planets are Sun, Jupiter, Mercury Venus and Kethu. They are also the
		significators.. Therefore they will give her child during their conjoined period. and sub period.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to dasa-bhukti at the time of judgment, Mercury Dasa balance was 1 year 1 month and 23
		days from 3-8-1969. The bhukti running is that of Saturn. Saturn is not a ruling planet. </p>
	<p class="block_4">So Saturn Bhukti will not give. Kethu Dasa will start 26-9-1970. On 23-2-1971 Venus Bhukti will
		commence, On 26-9-1971 Jupiter Anthra will start. This will run upto 22-11-1971. This period will give her a
		child, if transit agrees.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun transits Jupiter star Kethu sub in Venus sign Tulam on 22-10-1971. Therefore transit also
		agrees and she will have a child on this date. (Let us wait and see how the prediction comes true.)</p>

	<p class="block_4">The position of Moon called Mathi, the mind, shows the nature of the query. What he has in mind,

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Lagna is Cancer-Kataka. It is governed by Moon. Lagna gains strength as it is directly aspected
		by Moon. (A sign gains strength if it receives aspect from its lord or if it is occupied by him.) so Lagna is
		strong.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Lagna is not occupied by malefics. Nor it is aspected by evil planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence, what you want to have, you will surely have.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Moon, the planet indicating the query is in the sign Capricorn ruled by Saturn, in the star
		governed by Sun-Uthrashada, and in the sub of Jupiter..</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As per stellar astrology, Moon in Sun's constellation indicates the matter signified by Sun who
		owns the second house. The second house denotes Family and Finance."</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Most of the people are worried about "Family and Finance". So, Moon in Sun's star does not
		specifically mention the nature of the query.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now study the sub and also Sun. As Moon was in 2° 45", it is in Sun's star Uthrashada and in the
		sub of Jupiter. Jupiter is the chief governor for children and money. Again, to climinate either and for
		clarification to select the exact nature of the query, furthermore one is to study.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Take Sun, the lord of the constellation. It is in the constellation of Kethu who occupies the 5th
		house which governs the birth of a child.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Consider Jupiter who is the lord of the sub. It is in the 11th bhava, in the constellation of
		Sun. Jupiter is strong to indicate children, 11th house is the fifth from the seventh.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence the query is about "child-birth."</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">First of all, one is to find out the evil influences and ascertain its magnitude. Then only, one
		is to consider the favourable aspects promising an affirmative answer..</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Houses 6, 8 and 12 occupied by malefics, threaten loss, difficulty, delay or denial. 6th house is
		vacant; 8th house is occupied by Saturn which is in Jupiter's constellation and thereby its evil results are
		initigated by Jupiter. Hence it will be a delaying planet and not a denying one, 12th house is unoccupied.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence there will be much delay in becoming the father of a child.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">You have asked me to suggest as to what you should be.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Answer: You have to perform "shanthi." You have mentioned that you pray for Lord Ganesh. It is
		correct, because' the 5th house indicates the initiation of the Mantra, Upasana etc. Kethu is in the 5th house.
		It is aspected by Mars, the lord of 5, Jupiter, the religious planet ruling the 9th house and the planet Saturn
		throwing obstacles, Mars and Kethu, having connection with the 5th house indicate that you are a devotee of Lord
		Ganesh.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whenever Jupiter aspects either the Ascendant or the Moon in a horoscope, the person will have
		faith and knowingly or unknowingly will be doing meritorious deeds: he may also pray or do "Shanti". In the
		Horary chart, Jupiter aspects Moon, who is also the lord of lagna and hence you will follow the advice to enjoy
		the beneficial results.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The query is about child birth. Houses 2, 5 and 11 are to be considered. The strength of the
		planets which signify those matters of the houses 2, 5 and 11 is to be taken in the following order:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(a) The planets in the constellation of the occupants of the houses, 2, 5 or 11;</p>
	<p class="block_4">(b) the occupants of the houses 2, 5 and 11;</p>
	<p class="block_4">(c) the planets in the constellation of the lords of these houses 2 or 5 or 11:</p>
	<p class="block_4">(d)the lords of these houses;</p>
	<p class="block_4">(e) those which are conjoined with these significators; or </p>
	<p class="block_4">(f) those receiving aspects from the indicators. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">House 2 is occupied by Mars. Its stars are Mrigasirisha, Chitra and Dhanishta. No planet is found
		in any of the three asterisms.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">House 5 is occupied by Kethu. It rules over the constellation Asvini, Makham and Moolam.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun and Venus are in Aswini star. No planet occupies either Makham or Moolam. Hence Sun and Venus
		are strong significators.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">House 11 is occupied by Jupiter and Rahu; Jupiter's stars are Punarvasu, Visakha and
		Poorvapathra. No planet is in Punarvasu, Neptune to which no dasa is allotted, is in Visakha, Reject it. Saturn
		is in Poorvapathra.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Rahu governs the three stars Arudhra, Swathi and Sathabhisha. No planet is in these
		constellations.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore Sun, Venus and lastly Saturn are the significators. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To confirm whether they are the real significators, consider ruling planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Today is Friday. Venus rules over Friday (23-4-1965). </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The constellation in which Moon transits is Uthrashada - its lord is Sun.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Which is the sign in which Moon is passing at the time of answering the query? Capricorn-Makaram.
		Who rules the sign, Capricorn? Saturn owns it. Hence this moment is ruled by Venus, the lord of the day, Sun,
		the ruler of the star Uthrashada and Saturn the owner of Capricorn.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore, when will a child be born?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As Saturn is in the 8th house, it delays. Venus, the lord of 11, will give the child in its
		Bhukti-Apakara sub period. The dasa lord will be Sun. Sun Dasa, Venus Bhukti, Saturn Anthra will be the time of
		the birth of the child.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">How to find out? At the time of answering the Moon was in Uthrashada star, governed by Sun. It
		was in 2° 45'. Therefore balance of Sun Dasa was 3 years, 3 months and 3 days.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun Dasa, Venus Bhukti will commence on 26-7-1967. It runs for one year. The anthra of Saturn
		will be operating between 17-3-68 and 14-5-68.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore you can except a child on a Karthika Nakshatra day between 17-3-68 and 14-5-68.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now, let us take the Western System, and find out how it coincides-Father, how that system also
		gives the same time.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Moon, by progression, in 3 years forms sextile aspect with the lords of 2 and 11, i.e., Sun and
		Venus.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun, by progression, as lord of 2, conjoins Venus-Sukra, the lord of 11 in 3 years from now
		onwards.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence, it is certain that you must have a child, mostly on a Karthika nakshathra day in the end
		of April 1968 when Moon transits the position of Jupiter.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">You mentioned that you have the idol of Lord Ganesh, in silver. For your information, let the
		following details be given.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"If one is afraid of one's longevity, have an idol made of wood or clay and pray. It bestows long
		life. Also, people desiring to have much of prosperity can have it in sandalwood. For victory over enemies, idol
		in clay or sandlwood or Swetha Arka is the best. An idol made of coral gives success in competition, authority
		power and health. Generally, rich people do not maintain good health. An idol made of gold possessed by them,
		will offer good health. Those who suffer from chronic disease may have the figure of the lord in the ring or
		pendant, for speedy recovery from the disease and to maintain good health in the future. If silver is used to
		make the idol, it gives name, fame, reputation etc. If the idol is made of copper, one will have chil- dren. If
		the idol is prepared in stone, will be lucky to have much of landed property.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">But one should handle the idol carefully and keep it safely. If the image is hurt, it is an ill
		omen. It affects the head man of the family. If any hole forms on the idol, there will be disease, trouble etc.
		However costly it may be to the temple authorities to be kept in the temple.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore, buy Lord Ganesh made of copper and pray him. "Prayers" during night hours will never
		go in vain as there will be less of disturbance and you can concentrate.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Lord Ganesh made of copper gives enthusiasm and encouragement. Ganesh will bless you with a

	<p class="block_13"> </p>

	<p class="block_4">Moon indicates the nature of the query. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">It is in a barren sign in the constellation of the abortive node Kethu who is the significator of
		the houses 5 and 6. Therefore the question is about the child birth.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Is it promised or not? As the question is from the male note the 11th and then only the fifth.
		The eleventh cusp is in 13° 38' in Capricorn in Saturn sign Moon star and the sub of one in the 12th house, So
		the 11th cusp denies. The fifth cusp is in 14 38 in the barren sign Leo in the sign of barren planet Sun star of
		the planet in the 12th house to the fifth and in the sub whose lord is in the 12th to the 5th house. This also
		does not promise. Generally houses 2, 5 and 11 are judged to note the time when one can have a child. Here the
		second house is vacant. Its lord is Mars. It is in the constlellation of the planet in the 6th house occupying
		the strong barren sign. Mars in 8 has no strength as it is also in sub of Rahu in 12. Lord of 2 is so spoiled
		that it is in 8, it is in the constellation of the planet in 6, and it is in sub of one in 12. Then how can
		there be an increase in the family by the birth of a child. It is out of question</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">5th house is occupied by Sun. It is in the constellation of Venus in the 4th house denying any
		child.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Lord of 5 Moon is in Kethu constellation who is in 6 and in the sub of the planet in 4 and is
		conjoined with retrograde plant Saturn, who is lord of 11 and 12.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 11th house is unoccupied. Its lord is Saturn. It is retrograde in the twelfth house to two.
		Hence there is no doubt at all. He can fondle with other's children only.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334449" class="block_12">When Can I Deliver?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">The Table of houses and Ephemeris of Raphael give the various longitudes in Sayana. To convert
		them to Nirayana we subtract Ayanamsa. Therefore, only correct Anyanamsa must be used to give correct
		predictions. If Ayanamsa is not correct, the whole basis of the calculations will be incorrect. There are
		several Ayanamsa in vogue. Of them that which gives the correct timing of events is to be used.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">It is established by Prof. Krishnamurti after a lot of creditable research work and experiments
		that, only those Ayanamsas used and advocated by him give correct results. Others do not.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Another never failing finding of Prof. Krishnamurti is the Ruling Planets. He has proved that the
		ruling planets at the time of judgment and those at the time of fructification of the event are same. The ruling
		planets are the lords of the day, rasi, star and lagna at the moment of judgment. Invariably in all cases,
		without any single failure, using ruling planets one can decide correctly the nature of event and predict
		precisely the time and date of its fructification. The ruling planets point out the correct answers to any
		query. The nature of query may be anything like time of birth, exact position of lagna, exact position of any
		other cusp, correct birth star, correct position of Fortuna, time of marriage, time of delivery, time of
		accident, time of death, etc., etc. the ruling planets will reveal the results. In fact, ruling planets help us
		to give precise predictions regarding any question even in the absence of birth chart.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The query here is about delivery. Doctor has given her a date somewhere in the month of November
		1969. She wants to know the exact date of delivery.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">At the time of query the lagna is Dhanus. It is ruled by Jupiter,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The star is Dhanista. Its lord is Mars.</p>
	<p class="block_4">The rasi is Makara owned by Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_4">The day is Wednesday governed by Mercury.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore the ruling planets are Jupiter, Mars, Saturn and Mercury.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">One should not make a haste and accept these ruling planets as they come. See whether any of them
		is deposited either in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet. If there is any, reject it. Mercury is
		deposited in the constellation of Mars who is retrograde. Reject Mercury and take Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, as the
		final ruling planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mars is by itself retrograde. But it is deposited in the constellation and sub of planets in
		direct motion. This shows that Mars is not barred off from giving the results. But it will not be able to give
		the results as long as it is retrograde. Once it becomes direct, it will give. The probable date given by the
		Doctor is in the month of November 1969. Mars is in direct motion then. Therefore Mars will give the results.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore finally the ruling planets are Jupiter, Mars and</p>
	<p class="block_4">Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When Sun transits a position in the Zodiac ruled by the ruling planets, the event will fructify.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun enters the sign Scorpio ruled by Mars on 16-11-1969, In Scorpio, there are stars of both
		Jupiter and Saturn. Which star to be chosen? When a doubt arises, always find out who is stronger. (In the
		ruling planets, the lord of the sign transited by Moon is stronger than the lord of the day, the lord of the
		star is stronger than the lord of the sign and the lord of lagna is stronger than the lord of the star).
		Jupiter, is the lord of the lagna in the ruling planets. Therefore Jupiter's star is to be chosen. In this, Mars
		sub is transited by Sun on 18-11-1969. The day is Tuesday ruled by Mars.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now check up whether transit of Moon agrees on this date. Moon transits Jupiter star in Saturn
		sign Kumba on this date. Therefore Moon's transit also agrees and the delivery will certainly take place on 18th
		November, 1969.</p>

	<p class="block_4">The chart showing the twelve cusps for Bombay for the given number and the planetary position for
		the above time and date is as under:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The lagna bhava is occupied by Kethu and Jupiter. Kethu indicates some danger to the native.
		Jupiter indicates that there will be some providential help. The owner of lagna, posited in 10th indicates that
		the lord of lagna is well deposited and that there is no danger to the life of the lady. But Mars aspecting lord
		of lagna by its 8th aspect is unfavourable, especially when Mars is a ruling planet. Kethu in lagna and Mars
		aspecting 11th indicate that there will be ceascerian operation. (Mars signifies use of surgical instruments and
		Kethu suggests some danger). However, Jupiter in lagna and well deposited show that there is no danger to the
		life of the lady.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334450" class="block_12">Will my Wife Deliver a Twin?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">If the sub-lord of the 11th cusp is deposited in the constellation of a planet which is either
		Mercury or which occupies any of the dual signs, Gemini, Sagittarius or Pisces then one's wife will deliver more
		than one at a time. Just like we see in the Horary Chart, it is also advisable to look to the number of the
		conception which she has, and then calculate, find out which house we have to judge. The cusp of that particular
		house should be ruled by a planet, which is deposited in the constellation of one who is either Mercury or who
		is deposited in one of the three duel signs.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334451" class="block_12">Am I Pregnant?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Astrology gives a clearer picture than even in medical test in the early stages of the
		conception. Frog test may fail. But Astrology will not. If one is anxious to know whether one is pregnant or
		not, then the sub-lord of the 5th cusp should be deposited in the constellation of a planet which is the
		significator of 2 or 5 or 11 and also deposited in the fruitful sign. If the sub-lord and the lord of the
		constellation were to occupy barren signs, give her mental strength that she is not on the family way. This
		particular question will be put by many in the 21st century. Therefore, youngsters can be verifying this fact by
		asking a number from the girls within a few weeks after getting married.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334452" class="block_12">When is the Child Birth?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Where medical science fails Krishnamurti Padhdhati succeeds, and it not only shows miracles but
		serves as an eye-opener to all those groping in the dark regarding the wonderful accuracy of advanced stellar
		astrology contained in Krishnamurti Padhdhati.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">It was the 9th September, 1969. I was attending an evening party along with many high Government
		officials and their families. One of the top officials (who is also my best friend) wanted me to predict the
		correct date and time when his wife would give birth to a child as she was in the family way. I immediately
		wanted to put the principles of Krishnamurti Padhdhati to test and asked him to give a number within 249. He
		said "245".</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(a) The number 245" mentioned shows the lagna is Pisces sign, Revathi nakshathra i.e., between
		22-13-20 and 23-20. This area is ruled by Guru as the sign lord, Budha as the star lord and Moon as the sub
		lord.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(b) The Moon at the time of query was also passing over Cancer (Kataka) 28° 1', which area is
		ruled by Moon as the star lord, Mercury as the lord of the nakshatra and Saturn as sub-lord.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(c) The day was Tuesday, its lord being Mars which at that moment was in 20 52 Vrischika, Mars
		sign, Mercury nakshatra and Saturn sub.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Summing up (a), (b) and (c), the positions of the planets functioning as significators; were:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(a) Jupiter, Mercury and Moon.</p>
	<p class="block_4">(b) Moon, Mercury and Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_4">(c) Mars, Mercury and Saturn..</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The above significators immediately gave me the clue that the strongest among them were Mercury,
		Moon and Saturn and the date of birth of the child would be on the day when Sun will pass over Virgo sign, Hasta
		nakshatra i.e. 15-40 to 17-46-00 Mercury sign, Moon nakshatra and Saturn sub which will be only on the night of
		Saturday the 4th October, 1969 and before sun-rise on Sunday.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Accordingly, I asked the gentleman to reserve a cabin in the Nursing Home, from the 4th October,
		1969 and shift his wife there on the afternoon of that date. He was not prepared to heed my advice on the ground
		that his family physician and the lady doctor treating his wife for the last eight months had emphatically told
		him the date of birth as 27-9-1969 and accordingly all his arrangements in the Nursing Home were finalised. His
		family physician was also present at the party and, on hearing of my prediction he came to argue with me. He
		confirmed again that the date calculated was 27-9-1969 on the basis of medical science and could not fail. I
		simply smiled and told the gentleman who put the query that if he could easily afford to bear the charges of the
		nursing home for one week unnecessarily, he could do so. I further informed him that after an hour when I would
		go back home, even the correct time of birth could be given to him by me, after a detailed calculation.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">He accompanied me to my place and, after detailed working, I told him that the date of birth
		would 4/5-10-1969 (Saturday night) and the time would be 2-50 A.M. (IST) He profusly thanked me for my labours.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Under medical guidance, he shifted his wife to the Nursing Home on 25-9-1969 and kept her there
		till 29-9-1969 but without any avail. He then came to my place on 30-9-1969 to get my confirmation again, held
		to the same opinion.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to my advice, he again admitted his wife in the nursing home on 4-10-1969. The next
		morning at 6 A.M. he came, this time to congratulate me on my prediction he was blessed with a son at 2-50 A.M.
		on Saturday night, ie, on 4/5-10-1969, precisely as was predicted 26 days in advance.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Is it not a miracle of Krishnamurti Padhadhati? How wonderfully the result came correct while the
		calculations of medical science utterly failed?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now, for the information of the students of Krishnamurti Padhdhati I am giving below the details
		of my calculations on the basis of which the prediction was made.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Question: When is the birth of the child expected?</p>
	<p class="block_4">Number: 245. </p>

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 5th cusp is very important to see whether one is capable of producing a child or not. The
		11th house is the 5th house of the partner. Therefore the 11th cusp shows whether the partner will be able to
		produce children or not. If both 5th and 11th cusps are unfavourable, both the husband and the wife will be
		sterile and if such a couple wants to have a child, the only way out is to adopt somebody's child.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To judge the time of birth of child, one has to select the significators of houses 2, 5 and 11
		predict the time during the conjoined period of the significators.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">One will be able to produce children if the following three conditions are simultaneously

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">1. The sub lord of the 5th cusp is not retrograde,</p>
	<p class="block_4">2. It is not posited in the constellation of a retrograde planet, and</p>
	<p class="block_4">3. It is a significator of either 2nd or 5th or 11th house.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If any one of these three conditions is not satisfied one will not be able to produce a child at
		all.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To assess the productivity of the life-partner, judge the 11th cusp sub lord and find out whether
		the above three conditions are simulataneously satisfied or not. If they are satisfied, the partner can produce
		children. If any one of the three conditions is not satisfied, productivity of the partner is not promised Let
		us see whether the consultant (husband) can produce a child or not. Consider the 5th cusp. It is Karkata 15°
		17', i.c. Moon sign Saturn star Jupiter sub. Jupiter is retrograde. Therefore the husband cannot produce.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now let us see whether his wife can produce a child. (If she can produce, then naturally, the
		child will not be due to the husband). For this we have to judge the 11th cusp. It is 15° 17' Makara i.e. Saturn
		sign Moon star and Jupiter sub. Jupiter being retrograde, she too, is incapable of producing children.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore both the husband and the wife are sterile and if at all they want to have a child the
		only way is to adopt somebody's child.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The consultant said that he wanted to adopt the first child of his friend.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To find out whether a particular child will go in adoption or not, one has to judge the 4th cusp
		of the child. If the sub lord of the 4th cusp is deposited in a dual sign (or the sub lord itself is Mercury)
		and if this sub lord is a significator of the 8th house (as it is the house of legacy) the child goes in
		adoption.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">8th house here plays a double role. One as the house of legacy (the adopted child has a legal
		right on the property of the adopted father), and another as the 12th house to father (indicated by 9th house)
		showing separation from the father and going to the adopted father.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 4th house shows mother and the sub lord of 4th cusp decides whether one goes in adoption or
		not. A doubt may arise in somebody's mind as to why the 4th cusp be seen and why not the 9th. The answer is very
		simple. Maternity is sure and paternity is not. (The mother may have had pleasure with a person other than the
		husband and this child may be due to him.)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The consultant has no child of his own. He wants to adopt the first child of his friend. Friend
		is shown by the 11th house.. Therefore lagna of the child will be the 3rd house (5th to 11th. counted from the
		consultant's lagna.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The houses 4 and 8 of the child will be 6 and 10 counted from the consultant's lagna. Therefore
		we have to judge these two houses.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 6th cusp is 17° 17' Leo, i.e. Sun sign Venus star and Moon sub. The sub lord Moon is
		deposited in Mithuna. It is a dual sign. Therefore the consultant can adopt his friend's first child if the sub
		lord Moon is also a significator of 10th house.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Moon is a significator of 10th house. Therefore you will adopt your friend's first child.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">For the time of the event take out the significators of the houses 6 and 10 from the above table.
		They are Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mercury is in the constellation of a retrograde planet and Venus and Saturn are in the sub of
		retrograde planets. Planets in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet appear to give results but will
		ultimately fall through. Therefore exclude Mercury, Venus and Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Further Sun is conjoined with Rahu and Jupiter is conjoined with Kethu. Therefore take Rahu in
		preference to Sun and Kethu in preference to Jupiter because node firstly give the results of the planet or
		planets with which it is conjoined, then the results of the planets in whose constellation it is deposited, then
		the results of the planets aspecting it and lastly the results of the owner of the sign in which the node is
		deposited.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore finally the significators are Moon, Rahu and Kethu. They will give the results during
		their conjoined period.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to dasa-bhukti, Rahu Dasa Moon Bhukti Kethu Antra will run from 11-8-1970 to 12-9-1970.
		You will adopt in this period:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The exact date of adoption will be decided by transit. Sun transits Moon sub in Kethu star Makha
		in the sign Leo owned by Sun (represented by Rahu in dasa-bhukti) on 22-8-1970. Therefore you will adopt on this
		date.</p>

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To know whether one will win at all, judge the 11th cusp and find out whether the sub-lord of

		one cannot win. If the sub lord and the lord of the constellation in which the sub lord is situated are in
		direct motion and if such a sub-lord of 11th cusp is also a significator of the houses 2 or 6 or 11, then one
		will win.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To note the sub-lord the number 3 is given within 249 and the horary chart for this number at
		Bombay is as given above. The planetary position is for the time of judgment. The 11th cusp is Makara 22° 58'
		i.c, Saturn sign Moon star and Sun sub. Sun is never retrograde. It is posited in the constellation of Rahu.
		Nodes firstly, give results of the planet or planets with which they are conjoined, secondly the lord of the
		star in which it is deposited, then the planet or planets aspecting them and then the lord of the sign in which
		they are deposited. In the present case Jupiter is aspecting Rahu and also Rahu is deposited in the sign Meena
		owned by Jupiter. Therefore Rahu represents Jupiter.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Jupiter is not retrograde. Rahu's motion is always retrograde. But such a retrograde motion of
		the nodes should not be confused with the retrograde motion of other planets.. The reason is that planets, when
		retrograde, move in a direction which is opposite to the usual. On the other hand the usual direction of motion
		of the Nodes never gets reversed.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore the sub lord of 11th cusp is neither retrograde nor deposited in the constellation of a
		planet who is retrograde. Now, to know whether he will win or not, what remains to be seen is whether the sub
		lord of 11th cusp is also a significator of house 2 or 6 or 11.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sun is in the constellation of Rahu and sub of Mercury. Rahu represents Jupiter. Jupiter is in

	<p class="block_4">11th house shows fulfilment of one's desire. Whether the desire will be fulfilled or not is to be
		decided from the planet or planets in 11th bhava and its owner. Saturn delays. Fast moving planets fulfil the
		desire early. Others fulfil it in a medium time.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In your case no planet is in 11th bhava. Saturn owns it. Therefore delay is indicated.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 2nd house is for improvement of bank position, 6th for loss of opponent and 11th for gains
		and fulfilment of desire, So consider the houses 2, 6 and 11.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">2nd house is occupied by Mercury. Kethu is in Mercury's sign Kanya. Moon is in Mercury star and
		Saturn is in Kethu star.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">6th house is occupied by Jupiter and Kethu. Rahu is in Jupiter sign Meena. Therefore planets in
		the constellations of Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu are strong significators of 6th house. Sun is in Rahu star, Saturn
		is in Kethu star and Rahu is in Jupiter star.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">11th house is unoccupied. Saturn owns it. Mars is in Saturn star. Mars is retrograde. This
		indicates that Mars will not give results till it is retrograde. After that it will give.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore the significators of the houses 2, 6 and 11 are Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter,
		Saturn, Rahu and Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 7th house shows opponent houses 2, 6 and 11 of the opponent are 5, 8 and 12, counted from
		lagna. Therefore the significators of these houses will give gains without pains to the opponent. 5th house is
		vacant. 8th is occupied by Mars and Moon and 12th by Rahu. Further, Moon, Mars and Saturn are owners of houses
		5, 8 and 12 respectively. No planets are in any of the stars of Moon and Mars. Sun is in Rahu star and Mars in
		Saturn star. Therefore Sun, Moon, Mars, Saturn and Rahu are the significators of houses 5, 8 and 12.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If these significators are excluded from the significators of houses 2, 6 and 11, then the
		remaining significators will give beneficial results to the querist regarding gains without pains, Therefore
		these beneficial significators of houses 2, 6 and 11 are Mercury, Jupiter and Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now let us find out the ruling planets. The day is Saturday ruled by Saturn. Moon transits
		Mercury star in Vrischik sign owned by Mars. The lagna is Dhanus owned by Jupiter. Both nodes Rahu and Kethu
		represent Jupiter.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore the ruling planets are Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The common between the beneficial significators and the ruling planets are Mercury, Jupiter and
		Kethu. Therefore you will have gains without pains during their conjoined period.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mercury Dasa is already on. As its dasa balance is 5 yearsb 8 months and 12 days, Kethu bhukti is
		not to come. Jupiter</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">bhukti will run between 15-3-1970 and 21-6-1972. In the Kethu Antra will run between 9-3-1971 and
		27-4-1971. Therefore this period will give.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to transit, when Sun or Mercury transits the 19th degree of Meena, you must get the
		lottery prize. (19° Meena is Revathi star, ruled by Mercury, sign is owned by Jupiter and sub is governed by
		Kethu.) Sun transits the 19th degree in Meena on 5-4-1971 and therefore on this date you will receive the

	<p class="block_4">Venus Dasa balance 17 years 10 months 13 days. Competition, cards, game, speculation, races,
		lottery are all speculative ones, bringing casual income not to be taxed even. Such an attempt will be made
		during the period of a planet connected with 5th house, counted from the lagna. If the query is for younger
		sister or brother, take the 3rd house counted from Horary lagna as the Ascendant for that youngster. If the
		query relates to mother, take the fourth house. If it refers to children take the 5th as lagna to children. To
		wife take 7th, to father take 9th and to elder brother or sister take the 11th and find out.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">2, 6 and 11th houses are to be judged. Any of the significators should have connection with 5th
		also.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">2nd house is occupied by Moon, Sun and Mercury. No planet is in the stars of these three. These 3
		planets, sub periods are to improve bank position.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">6th house is occupied by Rahu. None is in its star. During Rahu sub periods one can gain.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">11th house is unoccupied. Lord is Sun. It will do good in its period. The query is whether he can
		gain in the end of February 1968. At that time, Venus in lagna bhava, in the constellation of Saturn in 5th
		house and sub of Saturn operates. As the sub lord is advantageous to the opponent, you cannot win. The sub
		period lord is Venus: sub sub will be ruled by Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As the opponent is shown by the 7th house and wife is also indicated by the 7th, one may ask why
		one should not buy on wife's name.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">True. But one should know, how to differentiate between wife, partner in business, second issue,
		father's elder brother etc., as 7th house indicates all these relates.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The Horary Lagna is in Venus sign Jupiter star Jupiter sub. The querist is born in Libra and Rasi
		Aquarius, star Poorva-bhadra is governed by Jupiter, Hence the lagna indicates the person.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The seventh cusp (navamsa) is at 20 of Aries. It is ruled by Mars (lord of lagna) Venus (lord of
		star), Rahu, lord of sub. This indicates that such a relative or partner in business or second child and so on,
		whose ruling planets are Mars. Venus and Rahu can gain, i.c. they should be the lord of the day, star, rasi and
		lagna. If the wife's ruling planets agree, purchase on her name. If it agrees with that of your partner, ask him
		to buy. If the second son's ruling planets agree, buy on his name. If none of these agree, none of you will
		gain. Some stranger will win.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Similarly consider the planets signifying 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th and 11th houses. If that relation's
		ruling planets at the time of birth agrees, that relative can win.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">This is the only way to eliminate others and select that particular relation, even though the
		same house indicates many relations.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To me, it appeals that the mother will gain. Why? It is not because the ruling planets agree.</p>
	<p class="block_4">But let us judge.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Second house counted from 4th is occupied by Saturn: 4th house is owned by Saturn: It is in the
		constellation of Saturn and sub of Mars, lord of 11 to 4.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sixth house is unoccupied. It is owned by Mercury. No planet is in its star. Mercury is a
		benefic.</p>
	<p class="block_4">11th house is occupied by Sun, Moon and Mercury. None in their stars.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Venus is lord of 5 and 10 in 10th bhava in the star of planet in 2 and sub of Saturn in 2 and
		lord of 2.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence Venus gives the mind to speculate. Saturn in the 2nd to the 4th house indicating lagna of
		mother shows increase in income. If one wins, the cash can be had, a few days later. Hence, it will be the sub
		period of Venus.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore predict that mother will gain. Luckily 4th house does not indicate other relations.
		According to Westerners it indicates father. But I take 4th house to denote mother and 9th house for father,
		because lagna is the 5th from the 9th and everybody will be proud of saying that he or she is the son or daugher
		of the father:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Take your mother to races on the day when the star is Anuradha or Dhanishta. Let her buy a

	<p class="block_4">The 6th house is the house which indicates debt or borrowing. To know whether one borrows money
		or not, judge the 6th cusp and find out whether the lord of the sub of the 6th cusp is either retrograde or
		deposited in the constellation whose lord is retrograde. If either is retrograde, one cannot borrow. If the sub
		lord and the lord of the constellation in which the sub lord is situated, are in direct motion, then one will be
		able to borrow. If it is Sun the loan will be from Government. If it is. Moon, very quickly the lender will
		agree to give. If it is Mars, there will be an atmosphere of tension in borrowing. If it is Mercury, one will
		correspond, send agent and will borrow in instalments. If it is Jupiter, with honour and by lawful means one
		borrows. If it is Venus, in a friendly way the borrowing will take place. If the sub lord is Saturn, then there
		will be some delay and obstacles in borrowing. If Saturn aspects the sub lord of the 6th cusp, even if it is
		Jupiter or any other planet, one gets only a part of the amount or gets the amount part by part.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In your case, the 6th cusp is 17 15 Aries, i.e. in Mars sign Venus star and Moon sub, Moon is
		never retrograde. It is posited in the constellation of Rahu. The motion of Nodes is always unidirectional.
		Unlike retrograde planets it does not get reversed in motion. A retrograde planet appears to change its usual
		direction of motion and moves in an opposite direction. This retrograde nature of motion of the planets should
		not be confused with the unidirectional retrograded motion of Nodes. So Moon's deposition in the constellation
		of Rahu should not be interpreted as deposited in a constellation whose lord is retrograde. The inner meaning of
		the term retrograde here is the reversal of usual direction of motion and Nodes never change their usual
		direction of motion.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore the sub lord of 6th cusp is neither retrograde nor placed in a constellation whose lord
		is retrograde and therefore, you will be able to borrow.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 6th cusp is in Venus star and sub of Moon. Venus indicates that the borrowing will be in a
		very friendly manner. Moon denotes that the lender will quickly agree to give you the amount. But Saturn
		aspecting Moon foreshows that he will not give you full amount. But a little less. The sign lord Mars portends
		that you will be upset and angry in your mind because he agrees to give you little less than what is requested.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now to know the time of event consider the ruling planets. The day is Sunday owned by Sun. Moon
		is in Mercury sign and Rahu star. Kethu is in Mercury sign Kanya. The lagna is Dhanus owned by Jupiter. Kethu
		and Jupiter are conjoined in Kanya. So Kethu is very strong. Therefore the ruling planets are Sun, Mercury,
		Rahu, Jupiter and Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As you are to get the amount very soon (because the sub lord is Moon), the dasa-bhukti method
		will not be useful here. Very soon means within a month or so. In all such cases wherein the result is
		anticipated within a month or so, consider the transit of Moon and predict.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The strongest of the ruling planets is the lord of lagna. It is Jupiter here Kethu conjoined with
		Jupiter is stronger than Jupiter to give the result. Kethu is doubly strong because it also represents Mercury,
		another ruling planet. So Moon must transit in Kethu star. Kethu star Aswini is in Mar's sign Mesha, Makha is in
		Sun's sign Simha and Mula is in Jupiter sign Dhanus. Mars is not a ruling planet. Sun and Jupiter are ruling
		planets. So Moon will give the result while transiting Kethu star either in Simha or Dhanus, whichever is
		earlier from today.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">On July 20, 1969, Moon is transiting Kethu star Magha in the sign Simha and therefore on this
		date you will borrow.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Always, he with whom one deals, whether he takes or gives, is to be judged from the 7th house.
		When you borrow, he loses. You receive a cheque means another has issued the cheque. If one is to give, it is
		found from the 12th house to his lagna. Younger brother is shown by 3rd house. The 12th to 3rd is 2nd. Therefore
		borrowing from younger brother is indicated by the houses 2 and 6. If mother gives 3 and 6. If children give 4
		and 6. If wife gives 6; if partner in business gives, 6th; if one with whom we deal gives, then also 6th; if
		father gives 8 and 6. If elder brother gives 10 and 6. If friend gives 10 and 6. This is how one is to note from
		whom one borrows.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>

		out whether the lord of the sub of the 12th cusp is either retrograde or deposited in a constellation whose lord
		is retrograde. If either is retrograde, one cannot either invest or repay loan. If the sub lord and the lord of
		the constellation in which the sub lord is situated, is in direct motion, then one will invest or repay loan. If
		it is Saturn, then there will be delay and some obstacles to repay. If it is Mercury, one will correspond, send
		agent and repay in instalments. If it is Jupiter, by lawful means all the legitimate amount will be repayed. If
		Mars is the sub lord, the lender threatens and then the borrower repays. If Moon is the sub lord, very quickly
		money is repayed. If it is Venus, with a spirit of compromise and sweet words one repays. If Sun is the sub
		lord, through the help of either father or Government officials one repays. If Saturn aspects the sub lord, may
		it be any planet, one repays only a part of the whole or repays part by part.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To note sub lord, the number given by the querist within 249 is to be used. The number given here
		is 20 and the Horary chart prepared from this number according to K. P., with the planetary position at the

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In this horary chart the 12th cusp is 21°3′ Pisces, ie. in Jupiter sign Mercury star Venus sub.
		The sub lord Venus is in direct motion. It is deposited in the constellation of Moon who is never retrograde.
		This shows that you will definitely be able to repay your loan.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As the sub lord of the 12th cusp is Venus, compromise and sweet words will govern the repayment.
		Saturn occupying the 12th bhava and aspecting Mercury, the constellation lord of the 12th cusp, portends that
		you will not repay full amount. But a little less. Further Mercury indicates that you will repay in instalments
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To know the time of repayment find out the ruling planets at the moment of judgment, i.e. at 7-30
		P.M. L.S.T. on 16-7-1969.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>

		by Saturn.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore Mercury, Kethu, Moon and Saturn are the ruling planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>

		beneficial. We have already seen above that the repayment will be little less than the full amount and that too
		will be in instalments. These instalments will be paid in the conjoined periods of the ruling planets. Balance
		of Mercury Dasa is 9 years 9 months and 29 days from 16-7-1969. In this , Moon Bhukti has already commenced on
		15-6-1969. This will run upto 15-11-1970. Therefore the various periods of repayment of the loan will be as
		follows:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The ascendant indicates the querist. Whatever the sub-lord of the ascendant (the planet ruling
		the sub-division of the constellation on the cusp of lagna) indicates, whichever matter the sub lord of the
		Ascendant signifies, that is what he would like to know. The seventh cusp shows the thief. The matter lost is
		shown by the sub lord of the second cusp. Recovery is shown by the 11th cusp and the time of recovery is shown
		by the significators of the 2nd and the 11th houses.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The ascendant falls in Rahu star and Saturn sub. Saturn is the significator of the 8th, 7th, 4th
		and the 5th houses. The 7th indicates the thief. The 8th house indicates possession of movable currency or
		liquid cash by the thief: the fourth, indicates his profession; and the 5th house is gain.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whether the article will be recovered or not, depends on the sub lord of the 11th cusp. As the
		11th cusp falls in 26-32 of Leo, the sub lord is Kethu. Kethu has to cause the results of the lord of the
		constellation according to the constellation lord's occupation. Kethu is situated in the 11th house in the
		constellation of Sun occupying 10 and owning the house 11. Therefore the sub lord promises recovery.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When? Find out the significators of the 11th house. Kethu and Jupiter are in 11. Rahu alone is in
		Jupiter's star. Moon is in Kethu star. Jupiter, lord of 6 occupying 11, is very auspicious.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Today it is Thursday, governed by Jupiter. Lord of the star is Kethu and lord of the sign is Sun.
		Hence when Moon passes by transit the portion which is together governed by Jupiter, Kethu and Sun the stolen
		money will be recovered. This can happen when Moon transits in Sun's sub in Moola star ruled by Kethu, in
		Jupiter's sign or Jupiter's sign Sun star and Sun sub. It will be 3 degrees Sagittarius or 27 degrees
		Sagittarius. It will not be on a Friday or Saturday when Moon would be in Moola. But it will be only on a
		Uthrashada day. So, on Sunday, the 24th August 1969 in the afternoon when Sagittarius rises, the money will be
		recovered.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Description of the thief: As Saturn is in the 7th house, the person is servant. Guide Bonatus
		says that if the thief's significator be Mercury he is very young; if Venus, a youthful but yet young female.
		Mars shows him to be of full age, Jupiter of middle age and Saturn elderly people. If it is Sun, he is young if
		Sun is 12 or 11 or 10th house. If Moon is the significator, then the age of the thief will correspond to the age
		of the querist.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to me the sub lord of the 7th cusp shows whether the thief is young or old. Also the
		sub lord indicates the sex of the thief. Here the seventh cusp falls in 10-26-50 of Aries, The sub lord is
		Saturn and Saturn is also in 7. Saturn is a masculine effeminate. It is in a masculine sign. It is in the sub of
		a masculine planet, Sun. Hence one can with confidence declare that he is an aged male servant.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to me, one is to find out the relationship between the querist and the thief.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If the significator of the seventh house is also the significator of the first house, then the
		thief will be a well-known person who frequents the house and one who has already created an impression for
		honesty. If the significator of the seventh house is also the significator of the second house, then one of the
		members of the family ought to have taken the substance. If the significator of the seventh is also the
		significator of the third house, then the neighbour or younger brother or messenger or orderly would have
		knocked it. If it is the significator of the 4th also, it is one who resides in the same house or compound. If
		it is the significator of the fifth also the thief would be one among his own children or the musician who
		visits the house or the person with whom the querist has developed love or having some pleasant pursuits. If the
		significator of the 7th is the significator of the 6th also, it must be the servant or one in bad health or an
		open enemy. If the significator of the seventh is also the significator of the 8th house, it is a stranger
		notrelated to the person who has lost; or it may be one who is temporarily appointed or one at times employed at
		the house, like gardener washerman, sweeper, etc. If it is also the significator of the 9th house the thief is a
		stranger belonging to another land, of a different caste and an absolute stranger. It may a sanyasi or a
		religious person in disguise. If it is the significators of the 10th also, then the thief is one in respectable
		circumstances, or some businessman who knows where the things are kept and whom normally nobody will suspect. If
		the significator of the 7th is also the significator of the 11th, it is a friend or elder brother or one whose
		services were utilised and who was in the confidence of the querist before. If the significator of the 7th house
		is also the significator of the 12th house also then the thief will be a stranger, beggar, a poor fellow who
		ever borrows money, a person in miserable condition, and one who always reveals in stealing as a profession.
		Here the significators of the 7th house is Mars; It is in the constellation Anuradha or Anusha ruled by Saturn
		in 7. No planet is in Mars stars. Mars is also the significator of the second house. Saturn is the significator
		of the 8th house, the 7th, the 4th and the 5th. Hence it is very clear that the thief is one who is in the same
		building moving like a family member, at times taken as a servant, and moves in such a respectable way that no
		one can ever take him to be a thief.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334461" class="block_12">Where is the thief?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">As Saturn indicates strongly the thief and also Mars and as the houses occupied by them are 1 and
		7 and they are in the sub of the Sun and Mercury, who are in the 10th house, an angular house (Kendra), he is in
		the same place. But if the significator would have been in the sub of a planet occupying the house 3, he has
		gone to a place close by. If the sub lord occupies the 9th house he has gone a long way off. If the significator
		of the first house and that of the 7th house are in the same sub lord then at the time of query the fellow who
		accompanied the person who has lost, is the fellow who had taken it and knocked it away.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Such an indication I had when two people came to my house at Madras and asked me about 15 years
		ago. I took the person who complained to me that he had lost a buffalo inside my room saying "Please come inside
		and pray to God Ganesh; you will get it." But when he alone came inside. I told him that the fellow who has
		taken you to me to consult, has got a hand in the theft. I asked him to keep quiet, be calm and patient. Then I
		came out and took the other man saying "why you have not come along with him. Come on, you also see the lord
		whom I got through the blessings of His Holiness Kanchi Kama Koti Peetadhipathi Jagadguru Shri Sankaracharya
		Swamigal" "Yes, Yes, I am coming," he said. Then he came inside. I told him "Hullo! According to astrology and
		Nimitham I had, I feel you were responsible for the theft of the buffalo. Tell me the truth or I will predict in
		your presence that you are mainly responsible for the loss of the buffalo. He said "Sir, the buffalo was grazing
		in my paddy field and asked my tenant to drive it a few miles off and put it in the Government Pound. I have not
		stolen. Alright, let us go, I said. Then we came to the consulting chamber. I told him "You both go and search
		in the Government pound. You will have your buffalo."</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The readers will be surprised to know that the animal was brought from the pound where the
		servant had left it and the friend who brought the querist to me for consultation was the one responsible. Thus
		the indications of the planets never, never fail. What is really lacking is the basis behind the prediction of
		the planetary portents-there should be only a single rule and not many, each contradicting the other. Astrology
		as a science has so far been relegated to the back- ground due to long time, neglect and discouragement to
		research. The only way astrology can be restored to its original glory is to discard all the decrepit, doubtful
		theories which confuse the consulted as much as the consultant and adopt correct methods evolved as a result of
		thorough and constant research. Krishnamurti Padhdhati paves the way.</p>

	<p class="block_4">Whether one borrows money or gets back one's dues, judge the 6th cusp and find out whether the
		lord of the sub of the 6th cusp is either retrograde or deposited in a constellation whose lord is retrograde.
		If either is retrograde, one cannot either borrow or recover that which had lent or given or deposited. If the
		sub lord and the lord of the constellation in which the sub lord is situated, is in direct motion, then one will
		recover the money. If it is Saturn, then there will be delay and some obstacles to recover. If it is Mercury,
		one will correspond, give notice, send agents and one will recover in instalments. If it is Jupiter and
		ill-deposited, one should go to the court and recover.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If Jupiter is the sub lord and is well deposited, one gets easily through court or by lawful
		means all the legitimate: amount. If Saturn aspects Jupiter, one recovers only a part of it or part by part. If
		Mars is the sub lord, one threatens the other and recovers. Even Goondas may be of real use. If Moon is the sub
		lord, very quickly money is regained. If Venus is the sub lord, then by compromise and sweet words, one fulfils
		his desire. If Sun is the sub lord, through the help of Government officials or by litigation one gains. Thus,
		one is to judge.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To note the sub lord and offer such a prediction, you should ask for a number within 249. Then,
		from the number, find out the sign, the star and the sub-Note at which degree and minute it starts. Take the
		Table of Houses by Raphael. Add Krishnamurti ayanamsa to the position of the sign star and sub found out for the
		number given within 249. Note the latitude of the place of judgment. One may correspond with you from North
		America or South America or Africa or Arabia or Australia. Do not bother about this place i.e., from where the
		querist wrote. But note from where you judge. Refer and find out only the latitude of the place of judgment.
		From the Table of Houses, find out the sidereal time for the ascendant- in Sayana-found out by you from the
		number given by the consultant and the ayanamsa added to it.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Noting down the sidereal time, refer and note down the cusps of the other 5 houses. Add 180° to
		these 6 figures and complete the 12 cusps. Now you have the map of the heavens in Sayana-Deduct Krishnamurti
		ayanamsa you get the figure for Nirayana chart with 12 cusps.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So, a number is asked to be given within 249. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">He gives 237.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">A chance is given to the astrologer to find out from number 78 within 108 and 237 within 249 and
		enjoy as the same result is obtained. This mysterious agreement can be found only in this Divine Science
		practised by intelligent astrologers making honest attempts with open mind.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">For 78, we get 16° 40′ Dhanus to 20 Dhanus.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">His query is not about health. In that case lord of Dhanus is retrograde and it is in the
		constellation of Moon in 2, being lord of 8. You have to predict considering these planets.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">But his query and the number given is for finding out whether the money given away can be had
		back.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If younger brother gives, second and sixth. If mother gives 3 and 6. If children give 4 and 6. If

		belongs to the querist's mother, the tenth house; if it belongs to his son, the 11th house; if it belongs to his
		maternal uncle, the 12th house, if it belongs to his father, the 3rd house will indictae the thief. Property

	<h3 id="id_Toc184334464" class="block_12">Whereabouts of thief</h3>
	<p class="block_4">If the tenth and Seventh houses (indicating the thief) significators form good aspect, the thief
		is at his house. If the seventh house (showing the thief) lord is connected with 6th and 9th, the thief has gone
		to a nearby place (because ninth house is thief to the 7th and houses 3 and 12 indicate short journey and stay
		in a neighbouring place; but if the seventh lord is connected with 3 and 6 houses, he has gone to a far far away
		place. If the seventh lord happened to be in a movable sign, the thief is still going on farther and farther
		away: if it is in a fixed sign and happens to be in the tenth house, he is in his own house; if the seventh lord
		is in the fifth house, which is a fixed sign, he will be in a friend's house; if the lord of seventh is in the
		third house in a fixed sign he should be staying with a stranger, if Rahu is in the third house, he will be in a
		rented place: Jupiter in 3 suggests temple, school, court, etc. Mars and Venus show hotel. </p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334465" class="block_12">Recovery of lost property</h3>
	<p class="block_4">If the significators of the houses 2, 6 and 11 agree (counted from the house indicating the

		ruling planets are connected with 5, 8 and 12 houses: it is lost once for all.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334466" class="block_12">Time of recovery of lost property</h3>

		properyt will be regained. To assure yourself, you work out backwards. The period that would have been operating
		on the day of theft, will be the significators of the houses 5, 8 and 12. The dasa lord in most of the cases
		will be the same at the time of loss and also regaining. In such cases, dasa lord will be the significator of 5
		and 2 or 5 and 6 or 8 and 11 or 11 and 12. If the Dasa lord is not connected with 2 or 6 or 11, in that Dasa

	<p class="block_4">The Officer, unhesitatingly mentioned "80"</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Generally I observed that whenever one talks, one used to mention "Two hundred times I told you,

		which is the maximum in the scale of pay Rs. 100-10-200: So he ever remembers 200. Another used to mention

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As the zodiac is divided into 108 equal parts 27 stars multiplied by 4 quarters and the number

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Moon is in the constellation of Venus and Saturn sub, Venus rules the 6th and the 11th houses.
		Hence, 6th house indicates dispute and 11th house promises compromisc as well as success. Moon denotes the
		query: it is called "Mathi", the mind: what one has in his mind is judged from the position of Moon. Moon in the
		8th Bhava indicates difficulty: Sun's sign occupied by Moon suggests the difference of opinion with the
		Government. Venus star-Poorvapalguni- occupied by Moon denotes transport department. Saturn sub confirms strike.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If Venus owns not only the 6th house and also any other house except the 11th one, then there
		will be further difficulty and compromise is not in sight.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As the 11th house promises honourable agreement acceptable by both the strikers and the

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When？</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As Venus rules the 11th cusp, find whether Rahu or Kethu occupies either of the sign belonging to
		Venus. Because the node is stronger than the lord of sign, and the tenant is stronger than the owner, Rahu
		deposited in Taurus owned by Venus, represents Venus. Hence one is to judge the sensitive point to be transited
		by Moon (under the sway of Venus by being deposited in Venus star), and the Ascendnat (in the constellation of
		Venus in Poorvashada).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Which is the sensitive point promising peace and settlement?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As Venus is lord of 11, Rahu denotes 11th house results by acting as an agent of Rahu, Vemus and
		Rahu are the significators.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Lagna is to be judged for success or failure. Lagna is in Jupiter's sign, Venus star, and in the
		sub of Saturn, Mercury or Kethu</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Jupiter is in the sixth bhava, showing that the person who put the question will start working
		when on Jupiter's day, Thursday or on Jupiter's star day Punarvasu or Visakam or Poorvapadra</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Saturn sub or Mercury sub or Kethu sub is to be considered. Saturn, lord of 2 and 3 conjoins with
		retrograde Mercury shortly within 24 hours and Mercury becomes direct in a day. Hence Saturn will delay and
		within 24 hours nothing can be settled but a depressing and threatening news will be published to unnerve the
		servants, Mercury governs nervous system, mental strength and news in the paper after interview.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mercury sub shows, a lord of 10, that till Mercury is retrograde i.e., Monday 4-4-1966, no
		compromise will be arrived at Only after it takes direct course, both the Government and the servants will come
		to an agreement on Mercury's day Wednesday or in Mercury star day Ashlesha, or Jyeshta or Revathi. Lagna will be
		governed by Venus, Rahu and Mercury.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Kethu is in Scorpio, but in 11th Bhava House. Kethu is also favourable. None of the sub is
		adverse: Therefore the astrologer has to use the science of Astrology--an intelligent anticipation by properly
		interpreting the message to the planets and select the time as well as the nature of event.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(1) I took the Ephemeris and found out whether there is a moment in the future, when the
		ascendant will be governed by Mercury, Venus, Rahu and Jupiter.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">On Wednesday, ruled by Mercury, Moon transits in Venus sign, Moon enters Swathi star only at 4-52
		P.M. Therefore on Wednesday 6-4-66 after 4-52 P.M. it improves. Then Jupiter sub is to be transitted by Moon.
		Moon passes in Rahu sub for a period of 18/120 of 22 hours 26 mts, =18/120 x1346=3 hrs. 22 mts. Adding this to
		4-52 P.M. I said that agreement will be arrived at only after 8-14 P.M. on Wednesday. It will not go beyond
		Jupiter's sub. Moon will transit in Jupiter's sub for 16/120 x22 hrs. 26 mts = 16/120 x 1346=3 hours. Therefore
		on Wednesday between 8-14 P.M. and 11-14 P.M. it will be agreed.. Venus sub sub will be at 9.44 P.M. when
		agreement is arrived at.</p>

	<p class="block_4">Lagna 6th house and 10th house indicate one's starting the work.</p>

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
