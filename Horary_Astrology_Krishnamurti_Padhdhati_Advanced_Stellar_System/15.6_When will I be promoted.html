Le. the nature of query ete, Moon is in 10th in the constellation of Sun (owner
of 6th) and sub of Venus (occupant of 2nd). Further Saturn (owner of 11th)
aspects Moon by its 10th aspect. Jupiter (owner of 10th) aspects Moon by its
5th aspect. Therefore the query is regarding the houses 2, 6, 10 and 11. These
houses put together indicate promotion. Therefore the query is regarding
promotion. But these houses 2, 6, 10 and 11 will be present in everybody's
chart and we can find out the significators in all these cases. Does it mean
that all these persons are promised promotion? No! Some may be promoted, others
may not be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, what one must necessarily see first is
whether one is to get promotion at all. For this consider the 11th cusp and
find out whether the lord of the sub of the 11th cusp is either retro- grade or
deposited in a constellation whose lord is retrograde. If either is retrograde,
one cannot get promotion. If the sub-lord and the lord of the constellation in
which it is situated are in direct motion and if the same sub-lord is also a
significator of houses2 or 6 or 10 or 11, then promotion is promised. Otherwise
not. Fulfilment of all these three conditions is a must. If any one of them is
not fulfilled, promotion is not guaranteed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In your case the 11th cusp is 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 17' Makar, ie. in Saturn Isign Moon star and Jupiter sub. Jupiter
is not retrograde. It is deposited in the constellation of Sun who is never
retrograde. Sun is owner of 6th house and therefore Jupiter is also a
significator of 6th house. Therefore all the three conditions are fulfilled and
you are promised promotion. The further procedure is to find out the ruling
planets at the moment of judgment: take out common planets in the ruling
planets and the significators; then work out the dasa-bhukti period of these
common planets and finally pin-point the date by the help of transit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The significators of all the twelve houses

</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From the above table, the significators of
the houses 2, 6, 10 and 11 are Mars, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Kethu, Sun, Moon,
Jupiter and Rahu. All the nine planets are significators, Of these Mars is in
retrograde motion. Those planets which are themselves retrograde in motion but
posited in the constellation and sub of planets in direct motion, will give
results after they become direct. They however can't give results as long as
they are retrograde. But if a planet, even when it is direct, it deposited in
the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet, it well appear to give results
but will ultimately fall through. Mars will therefore be able to give results
only after it becomes direct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The significators are many in number. The
best method to eliminate the unfavourable ones is to find out the ruling
planets and then find out the common between them and the significators. This
common planets will give the result during their conjoined period. The day is
Tuesday owned by Mars. The sign transited by Moon is Makar. Saturn owns it. The
star transited by Moon is Uttarashada owned by Sun and the Lagna is Scorpio
owned by Mars. So the ruling planets are Mars, Saturn and Sun. They are also
significators. So they will give you promotion during their conjoined period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As 11th house is owned by Saturn, there
will be delay in fulfilment of your desire. Further the same Saturn is lord of
12th and is posited in horary lagna. This is undesirable. Horary lagna is
spoiled. This indicates that there will be lot of obstacles and hindrances in
the way of your promotion and Saturn will delay the promotion till such time
that you will feel trustrated and start thinking that the promotion will not
come at all. But the same Saturn is lord of 11th and also a ruling planet and
therefore it has to give you promotion. It will play a double roll.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Anything in life which is promised by the
planets will be experienced when dasa-bhukti of the common planets between
significators and ruling planets operates. (Suppose child birth was promised to
a person and even for 10 years after marriage no child was born. This is
because the particular dasa-bhukti was not operating. Once it operates, he will
have.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly in the above case, though
promotion is promised, it will come only when dasa-bhukti of promotion
promising planets operates.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun's dasa balance is only 11 days from
1-7-1969. After that Moon Dasa will run. But Moon is not a ruling planet. So
during Moon Dasa you will not get promotion. (Actually, Saturn aspecting Moon
by its 10th aspect will throw obstacles: during Moon Dasa). Then comes Mars
Dasa. Mars is common in both significators and ruling planet. So it will give
promotion during its dasa.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars Dasa starts on 12-7-1979. It will run
for seven years. In Mars Dasa Saturn Bhukti must come. In Saturn Bhukti Sun
Antra must come and only then you will get promotion. Mars Dasa Saturn Bhukti
Sun Antra runs between 2-7-1982 and 22-7-1982. Therefore you will be promoted
in the month of July 1982. Till then Saturn will bring lot of obstacles,
failures. frustration, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="15.5_Prosperity of the Institute.html">← Prosperity of the Institute</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_15.6_When will I be promoted">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="15.7_Higher Status Any_ When.html">Higher Status Any_ When →</a></div></body>
