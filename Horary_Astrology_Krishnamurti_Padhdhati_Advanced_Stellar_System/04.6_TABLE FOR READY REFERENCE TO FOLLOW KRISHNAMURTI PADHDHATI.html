for seconds.) </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">﻿</span>……</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Example 1.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Calculation: Suppose a consultant gives a
number, say, 48 within 1 and 249, referring to the Table of Krishnamurti
Padhdhati, one can find, that number 48 refers to Mercury sign, Rahu star,
Jupiter sub, which commences at 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Gemini-Mithuna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since Krishnamurti Padhdhati is the
advanced stellar astrology, the zodiac is NIRAYANA one. But for finding out the
position of the cusps of the houses, we refer to Raphael's Table of Houses,
which is in Sayana system. Therefore, it is necessary to add the Ayanamsa of
that date of judgment to the position of the Ascendant, arrived at for the
number given by the consultant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here, the consultant has given number 48.
It means, the beginning of the sub of the ascendant is in Gemini in 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40'. Today, being 11th December, 1969, and the Ayanamsa is 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20', we have to add 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40' in Gemini and 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20' and we get 32</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. It means, the second
degree in Cancer will be the Sayana Ascendant. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The question is judged at Madras. One is to
take the latitude of the place where the astrologer judges the horoscope even
though the consultant would have written from any part of the world. Therefore,
the latitude of 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 04'N latitude for Madras is to be
taken up.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Referring to Table of Houses, we find that
the position of the cusps are given for 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> or 14</span>°<span lang="EN-US">. Since 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 04' is nearer to 13, we can
refer to the Table of Houses given for 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> latitude. In
that Table we have to find out where 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US">  Ascendant
in Cancer is given. So, we will find that he has given, for 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 54'in Cancer, and 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 45' in Cancer. But we
should find out the cusps of other houses if 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 
Cancer is to be the Ascendant. So, work out proportionately.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then, we will get that 28</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 7</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Cancer is the second cusp: 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 7' in Leo will be the third cusp; 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 7' in
Pisces will be the tenth cusp: 297 in Aries will be the eleventh cusp: 27 in
Gemini will be the 12th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All these are in Sayana position. We have
to convert them to Nirayana. Therefore, deduct 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>′<span lang="EN-US">. Then 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in
Gemini will be the Ascendant. 4</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 47</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Cancer will be the 2nd cusp: 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 47' in
Leo will be the 3rd cusp: 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 47</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Pisces will be the 10th; 5</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 47' in Aries
will be the 11th; 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 47</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in
Taurus will be the 12th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We have to add 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
to all these 6 cusps, so that 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> added to the
ascendant gives the position of the 7th cusp. 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US">
added to the second cusp gives the position of the 8th cusp; 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> added to the 3rd cusp gives the position of the 9th cusp :
similarly 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> added to the meridian (10th cusp) will
give the cusp of the fourth. 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> added to the 11th
cusp will give the position of the 5th cusp; 180</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> added
to the 12th cusp will give the position of the 6th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, the map showing the 12 cusps,

calculation: attends to some other job and then sits down again after some
minutes or hours or days, then the position of planets should be worked out for
the next sitting time, though the 12 cusps for that latitude remains the same.
But if one starts calculation, then goes away to another locality, the latitude
of the place is different, he has to refer to the Table of Houses for this new
locality, have the same position for ascendant (it means 7th cusp also) and
calculate the cusps for this new place and also the position of planets for the

based on the horoscope of a person may or may not be correct. All the position
of the 12 cusps depend on the moment of the birth time taken, and you decide
whether there is fulfilment of one's desire or not only from the sub-lord of
the cusps to be taken for judgment. Hence, it seems you prefer Horary to Natal

Horary is the best to get correct and amazing results".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For Horary am I to give a number?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes, please mention any number

comes out, one should refer only the Raphael's Table of Houses and not anything
else; we should avoid calculations. It is not uncommon that he who claims to be
good in Higher Mathematics fails miserably in Elementary Mathematics. One may
be M.A. yet he can err. Therefore, as far as possible, avoid calculations when
ready reference Table is available. So refer to Raphael's Table and when mine
is released refer to mine".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Sir, the table of houses is in Sayana
position. Is it not?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Yes. So you have to note the ayanamsa
on the day of judgment".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which ayanamsa am I to follow?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Follow Krishnamurti Ayanamsa alone. Forget
all others. When Krishnamurti Ayanamsa is used and by using the sub- division
of a constellation you come correct in minute details, it goes without saying
that the other ayanamsas are not to be followed, especially if it varies by
degrees? Follow only mine.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What is the Ayanamsa now?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">23 degrees 20 minutes. So you add this
figure to the nirayana position you got for the number you gave, i.c. 74. Hence
add 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> to 14</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 53</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> 20". Then the Sayana position of
the lagna would be 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 13' 20". Turn over the page
where the cusps of various houses are given for Delhi latitude. Then you will
get that Virgo 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 32</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> is the
second cusp; Libra 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 32</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> is
the third cusp; fourth will be 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 32</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Scorpio; fifth will be 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 32</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Sagittarius; sixth will be 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 32</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Capricorn and the other 6 cusps are 180 degrees opposite to these.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now we have got the Sayana position of the
12 cusps. Deduct the Ayanamsa and convert them to Nirayana. The following
figure is the map for the query and hereafter we have to note down the position
of the planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For which time are we to note the position
of the planets? If you judge a chart immediately after calculation, then you
have to note the position of the planets at which you started casting of the
horoscope for judgment. Cusps for each number can be done and kept as a ready
reckoner. You may keep a ready reckoner for any single locality for every
number between 1 and 249 if you ever stay there. One may note the position of
the planets and in continuation judge. That time alone should be taken for the
position of the planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">﻿</span><span lang="EN-US">Then are we to note for 7-30 A.M. I.S.T. or are we to convert the
time to L.M.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is only to find the cusps of the houses
one is to find out the time in L.M.T. But to calculate the position of the
planets you have to take the Indian Standard time. Because the position of the
planets in Raphael Ephemeris are for 12 noon Greenwich. That is why I have
given in my Ephemeris the position of the planets for 5-30 P.M. 1.S.T. I could
have given the position of the planets for 12 noon 1.S.T. But you cannot verify
easily with that of Western Ephemeris and confirm that mine gives exactly the
same position and is correct. So one can work with confidence. Doubt should
never be there. Therefore you calculate and insert in the map after deducting
ayanamsa from the figures obtained. Then the following is the horoscope for
judgment:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury Dasa at the moment of judgment
balance 5 years 11 months 20 days. We have to presume that Mercury Dasa Rahu
Bhukti started on 30-1-68.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">

could be verified shortly either on the same day or in a few days or in a few
months. Then only, one can, in his lifetime complete the research and come out
successful. The following will explain:-</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. The electric light was off. "When
we can have it?" I posed this question and asked somebody to give a
number: erected a horoscope immediately and I took the ruling planets as well
as the sign lord, the star-lord and sub-lord of the Ascendant. I waited till
the light came and then worked out the ascendant and with cusp (for the moment
when the light came for that latitude and longitude of the place). I noted the
lord of the sub. rising in the East, Le., the Ascendant and that of 11th cusp.
Thus, I carried on and found out that both the ruling planets as well as the
planets sign-lord, star-lord and sub-lord who govern the position, indicated by
the number, and 11th cusp gave the clue to arrive at the moment correctly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. When I was in service, the accountant
used to send a peon to the treasury to get the money. The peon had to return
the same day itself. He might return by 12 noon or any time. within 5 P.M. I
used to ask the accountant to give a number to find out when the orderly would
return. I worked out the ascendant for that particular moment; noted down the
ruling planets at the moment of judgment and waited till the peon returned.
Calculated the lords of the ascendant which I had, according to the number
given by the accountant, and noted the planets which would govern the sign,
star and the sub at the moment of the arrival of the orderly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. My daughter who was working in a
concern, used to return at any time between 5-30 and 6-30 P.M. To carry out my
research, I used to ask my wife to give a number within 249. Noted down the
ruling planets at the moment of judgment and also the lord of the sign, star
and sub for the number given by my wife; noted down the lord of the sign, the
lord of the star and the lord of the sub of the eleventh cusp. I found full
agreement and the prediction proved to be correct to the minute.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There used to be strikes in offices, and
the management used to give a number to find out when it would be called off
especially in Calcutta. I erected a chart for the moment of the judgment,
taking the ascendant according to the number given by the manager, and since
his desire was to call off the strike, I took the eleventh cusp and noted down
the lord of the sub. I passed my own judgment and waited to see when it was
actually called off. Since the prediction came very true, I began to improve
the method. Even the strike in Simpson's group was predicted by my son correct
to the hour. I do not call him a genius. All will consider him as a scientific
and able Astrologer. The agent of Bank of India, Mylapore Branch who was
present at that time phoned to me saying that the prediction was marvellous, as
none can even guess when it would be called off.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again, opportunities arose when I used to
book trunkcalls, to various places in India and the moment I book, immediately
I used to ask a student of mine sitting with me, to give a number within 249
and worked out. I took the houses 3, 9 and 11 to know when it would
materialise. It has been found by me that whenever the sub-lord of the third
cusp was deposited in the constellation of a planet in retrograde motion, in a
few minutes, the telephone office will call me and say that the line is out of
order and I cancelled the call. But if the sub-lord himself was retrograde and
the lord of the constellation direct, then I did not cancel the call, it
matured later. If the sub-lord of the 9th cusp was in the constellation of a
retrograde planet, I used to get the reply that the party with whom I wanted to
speak, was absent and I cancelled. But if the sub-lord himself was retrograde
his relatives at home asked the Telephone Department to keep the call pending,
sent word to the party and later gave connection. If the sub-lord of the 11th
cusp was situated in the constellation of a planet in retrograde motion. Then
even though they gave connection, neither I was able to hear him nor could he
hear me due to much of disturbance, and it was a waste. If the sub-lord himself
was retrograde, the staff in Telephone Department was complained about the
defect which they set right and we had the talk.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun and Moon ever direct, never retrograde.
Rahu and Kethu move in opposite direction; they never retrace; their pathway
and movement are steady in its own direction; hence treat Rahu and Kethu as
never retrograde. The other planets alone can be either direct or retrograde.
This is applicable to Krishnamurti Padhdhati.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus I used to pose such questions, erect
the horoscopes for the moment at which the matter was given, allow the time to
pass and noted down the time when exactly the matter materialised. Calculated
and found out the ascendant rising then and also the cusp of houses signifying
the matter, gave correct indication.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, on minor events research was done on
hundreds and hundreds of occasions, and WHEN EVERY QUESTION HAD COME VERY
CORRECT, it gave the mental strength to proceed further and apply to major
problems. In Astrology, whether the problem is a minor one or a major one, the
principle remains the same. Using one's commonsense one should proceed
scientifically.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is the way how I started research on
Horary Astrology after deciding that I should take the number between 1 and
249.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whenever there was none to mention a number
and the question pertained to me, I used to open a book of 400 pages and then
see the number of the page printed on the right side of the book. I worked out
for that number; erected a horoscope; posed myself some question and read out
the results. This worked out very satisfactory. If, by chance, the number of
the page which I noted down was above 249, the matter which I thought of, never
materialised. Decision of God is known at once. I never divided by 249.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For example, (1) I want to meet a friend of
mine. To find out whether he is in the headquarters, so that I could meet him,
for some favour. I used to open a book and whenever the number was above 249, I
found either he had gone overseas or he was in Delhi to attend some conference.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) On occasions when I tried for
reservation of a berth, on a particular date, and when such a number beyond 249
was noted, in spite of all my influence, it was impossible to reserve one
berth. Thus in matters where it could be immediately verified, I found that if
anybody were to give a number beyond 249; then one can immediately say that the
consultant cannot have his desire fulfilled without taking further pains for
calculation, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again, to find out the method whether it is
the right side or left side of one's body is affected, right leg or left leg
fractured: right hand or left hand amputated, etc., I used to put two drops of
honey on the floor and I used to observe the flies tasting the honey. I used to
open a book, note the number. I found sub-lord of the 6th gave clue. The fly
which was either on the right or the left, first flew away, 7th house shows
flies; They, to fly away means 12 to 7. i.e., 6th house. When I came very correct,
I began to find out which side of the body of a person (whether the right side
or left side) is affected. I noted the number from a book and took 6th house
indicating defect to the consultant. I did experiment on the numbers given by
the persons also when I took 12th cusp. Since honest attempts were made by me,
I used to ask my friend to sit along with me and face the same direction,
observing the flies. I used to predict in advance and on all occasions I came
correct. But if I would have been otherwise like a very few (which is not to be
ruled out) then I would have asked the friend to sit on the opposite side,
facing me. Without any working, I could say that the fly in the left will leave
first. If that which flew away is left to me I will tell him "See, I am
correct." And if that fly which is on the right to me, goes away first, I
will tell him, "You see, I am correct", you are the consultant; you
have to observe that which was in the left to you, had gone away, first. Thus
the dishonest person can twist, but Krishnamurti Padhdhati is only for one
answer and there is no room to twist. The answer is invariably correct,
whatever be in the mind of the consultant. If I said that which was on his left
would fly, even if he had in his mind the right one KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI
never failed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One of the greatest achievements is the
success in finding out that the Ruling planets reveal the truth and guides one
to correctly predict. This truth was never expounded by Hindu sages or Western
savants.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="04.5_ERECTION OF HORARY HOROSCOPE.html">← ERECTION OF HORARY HOROSCOPE</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_04.6_TABLE FOR READY REFERENCE TO FOLLOW KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI">返回目录</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="04.7_Twelve signs of the zodiac.html">Twelve signs of the zodiac →</a></div></body>
