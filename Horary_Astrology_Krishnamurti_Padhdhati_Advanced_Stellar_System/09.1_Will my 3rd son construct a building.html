7 days.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querist asked this question, gave the
number 114 within 249.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The number given by querist shows his
lagna. The query is about his third son. The first child is shown by the 5th
house counted from lagna. Younger brother or sister is shown by the 3rd house.
second child is therefore shown by 3rd to 5th, i.e. 7th from lagna and,
similarly, the third is shown by 3rd to 7th, i.e. 9th from lagna. Therefore the
lagna of the third child is the 9th house, i.e. Rishaba 11</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 43'. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 4th house shows one's own house, landed
property, estate, etc. The 11th house shows fulfilment of desire and the 12th
shows investment. Therefore the houses to be judged for construction of a
building are 4, 11 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is a house already constructed and is
to be bought off straight, judge the houses 6 and 9 also, Why? Because one who
is seller is shown by the 7th house. The 6th is 12th to 7th and the 9th is 12th
to 4th counted from 7th house. Further the houses 9 and 3 indicate surrounding
the premises by the previous party and entry in the new house by the purchaser.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For the purchase of the plot of land the
same rules do apply.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether one will be able to construct a
house at all, is to be seen from the 4th cusp. So, judge whether the sub lord
of the 4th cusp is either retrograde or deposited in the constellation whose
lord is retrograde. If either is retrograde then one will not be able to
construct a house. If the sub lord of the 4th cusp and the lord of the
constellation in which it is deposited are in direct motion and if this sub
lord is also a significator of either 4th or 11th or 12th house, then one will
be able to construct a building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The horary chart for the number 114 with
the twelve cusps for Bombay and the planetary position at the time of judgment,
i.e. at 1-40 P.M. I.S.T. on 27-7-1969 is given above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We have to judge the 4th house of the third
child. The 4th from 9th is the 12th from querist's lagna. Therefore we have to
judge the 12th cusp. It is 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 43' in Simha, i.e, in
Sun sign Kethu star and Mercury sub. The sub-lord Mercury is not retrograde. It
is deposited in the constellation of Saturn who is also not retrograde. Saturn
is deposited in 12th bhava, counted from the lagna of the third child. Therefore
Mercury (posited in the constellation of Saturn) is also a significator of 12th
house of the third child. Therefore the building will be constructed in the
name of the third son.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the father and his third child want to
live in the same house, the 4th cusp of father and that of the third son must
be connected to each other. The 4th cusp from the querist's lagna is 11</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 43' Dhanur, i.c. Jupiter sign Kethu star and Mercury sub. The 4th
cusp from the third child is in Sun sign Kethu star and Mercury sub. Therefore
the sub lord and the lord of the constellation of 4th cusp of both the father
and the child are Mercury and Kethu respectively. Therefore their dwelling
place will be same.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the sub-lord of 4th cusp from the
querist's lagna is deposited in 11th bhava, the desire of the querist will be
fulfilled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now let us find out the time of the event.
The house is to be constructed for third child. Therefore houses 4, 11 and 12
from 9th are to be considered. They are 12th, 7th and 8th respectively, from
the querist's lagna.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th house is occupied by Jupiter and Ketu,
7th by none and 8th by Saturn. Rahu is posited in the Jupiter star. Sun, Mars
and Mercury are in Saturn star and none is in Kethu star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th house is owned by Sun, 7th by Jupiter
and 8th by Mars. Jupiter is already considered above. Kethu and Jupiter are
deposited in Sun's stars and Venus is in Mars star.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore the significators are Rahu,
Kethu, Jupiter, Sun, Mars, Mercury and Venus. Which of these significators are
beneficial and which are just temptors is to be found out from the ruling
planets at the moment of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling planets: Today is Sunday ruled by
Sun. The sign transitted by Moon is Dhanus owned by Jupiter. The star
transitted by Moon is owned by Venus. The lagna is Tulam owned by Venus. As
Kethu is conjoined with Jupiter and Rahu occupies Jupiter sign Pisces, take
Rahu and Kethu also.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One should not accept these ruling planets
as it is. Check up whether any of them is posited either in the constellation
or sub of a retrograde planet. If there is any, reject it and accept the
remaining.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the present case none of the ruling
planets is deposited either in the constellation or sub of a retrograde planet.
Therefore the beneficial ruling planets are Sun, Jupiter, Venus, Rahu and
Kethu. They will give the result during their conjoined period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dasa: Venus Dasa balance is 16 years 9
months and 7 days. In this Rahu Bhukti will run from 4-7-1973 to 4-7-1976,
During this period you will finish construction of your house in the antras of
either Jupiter or Kethu or Sun. Jupiter is a ruling planet. Not only this, it
is also the constellation lord of the lagna at the moment of judgment. Further
it is the lord of 11th house counted from the lagna of the third son. Therefore
Jupiter Antra will give a finished house. This runs from 16-12-1973 to 10-5-1974.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Transit: We have now to see whether transit
agrees during this period. Consider the transit of Sun. Sun transits Venus star
in Jupiter sign Dhanus in December 1973. Therefore transit agrees during this
period and so you will construct your building during this period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From which date the querist will start
living in the new house? The present house of the native is shown by the 4th
house. The 3rd house shows changing the present place of residence. Mars owns
3rd house. There is no planet in the 3rd bhava. Venus is in Mars star.
Therefore Venus has to give 3rd house results also. Therefore you will change
the present place of residence and start living in the new house when Sun
transits Venus sub in Jupiter sign Venus star on 28-12-1973. 1974 is the most
pleasant and prosperous New Year and on the New Year day, you will be in your
own new house.</span></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid">
