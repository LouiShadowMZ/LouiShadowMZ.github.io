<body><h1 id="heading_01.1_INTRODUCTION_0"><span lang="EN-US">SECTION ONE</span></h1><h2 id="heading_01.1_INTRODUCTION_1"><span lang="EN-US">INTRODUCTION</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Four decades are over; the fifth is on.
Research is being carried upon the births of persons born in the same locality
with an interval of 10 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. I concentrated the study
upon the horoscopes of the twin births. I collected data regarding the time of
birth of the twins, the various results enjoyed by them and the time of such
events.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">While carrying out such a research, I found
that the general principles enunciated by our ancients and also those given out
by the scholars of other countries cannot be strictly adhered to and applied to
one and all; it is evident and clear, especially in twin births, since the rate
may come out correct in the case of one but fails miserably in that of the
other as the result is diametrically opposite. With due respect to the learned
authors and to the astrologers who strictly follow the principles, many consultants
have complained to me that there is no coherence, no clarity, whereas confusion
and contradiction do exist. They also have the same excuse, saying that planets
show tendencies. A few twist the rules and astrology is thereby made useful
only to the astrologers. Therefore, both the students of astrology and the
astrologers themselves have to honestly confess that there is no simple,
correct and convincing method which can be universally applied to one and all.
This is a fact.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By the grace of God, I evolved certain
methods which are most convincing, very clear and pin-pointing to the time of
event and explaining the nature of event to the entire satisfaction of the
querist and the astrologer. It guides properly. So, this method is the best and
is very useful to the querists, as the prediction comes out correctly; also, it
brings name and fame to the astrologer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore, I am publishing this book on
Horary System of Astrology after praying to God that the Truth which dawned in
my mind, may be well explained, properly illustrated and exhaustively dealt
with in a lucid manner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">R.A.V.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us first of all understand both the
Hindu and the Western systems </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">ASTROLOGY: HINDU AND WESTERN: </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some are under the wrong impression that
the Westerners borrowed knowledge from the Hindus; some others say that the
Hindus gained knowledge from the Chaldeans, Hebrews, Greeks and so on. Is the
view correct? </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sages and the scholars in each country
gazed at the stars, thousands of years ago, and they discovered the relation
between the celestial phenomena and the terrestrial incidents </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">They established some methods to fix the
position of planets in the Zodiac and the consequem effect on the animate and
inani- mate objects on the earth. Each followed certain methods to predict the
events. If one has studied both the systems, one will declare that neither the
Hindus borrowed from the Westerners, nor vice-versa. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose some students appeared for
mathematics examination: copies of the question paper were distributed to them.
All were busy answering them. The superintendent caught hold of a student
called him as one who had been copying the answers written by another student,
seated in front of him. He took this student and complained to the Headmaster
that he had been copying in the examination hall. On enquiry, the student
repeatedly said that he had not copied at all. The headmaster called for the
ans er papers of both the students and compared them. He declared that the
student had not copied at all and the complaint was baseless. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The student, who was accused to have
copied, had answered the questions 1.3. 5 and 7 in the question paper, whereas
the other student had answered questions 2, 4, 6 and 8. Hence, the Headmaster
who had gone through both the papers alone could know the truth. The
superintendent who saw this student writing fast, and also, off and on, looking
at the other student's table. had mistaken him, because both answered the same
mathematics paper. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, only when one studies both the
Western and Hindu systems, one will confirm that the method followed by either
is absolutely different from the other. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Zodiac: For both, the Zodiac is the
pathway of the planets. But for the Westerners, the commencement of the Zodiac,
i.c., Aries 0 retrogades at the rate of roughly 50.2388475 seconds every year,
whereas for the Hindus, for astrological purposes the Zodiac commences always
at a fixed point which is about 180 from the Star Spica-Chithirai. The Zodiac
of the Westerners is called Sayana Zodiac whereas that of the Hindus is called
Nirayana Zodiac, Therefore, as years pass on, in about 480 years, it will be found
that the Sign Aries-Mesha called by the Hindus will exactly coincide with
Taurus-Rishaba by the Westerners. The portion of the Zodiac called by the
Hindus as Taurus-Rishaba will be called by Westerners as Gemini-Mithuna and so
on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Mansions: Westerners have divided the
Zodiac into 12 equal parts and call them as Solar Mansions or signs. So also,
Hindus have divided it into 12 equal parts and call each division as a Rasi.
But there is the difference in the commencement of the signs as explained
above. Therefore, the area covered by the signs followed by the Westeners and
the Hindus is not the same. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Hindus have another method of dividing
the Zodiac. They have divided it into 27 equal parts and call them as Lunar
Mansions, Constellations, Asterism. Nakshathras or Stars. The Hindus give
greater importance to this division. They have found that planets transitting
in the same sign but in different Nakshthras cause different effects. Just like
each rasi (or sign) is said to be ruled by a planet, so also the Hindus declare
that each star is governed by a particular planet (e.g.) Aries sign (Mesha) is
ruled by Mars (Sevyai): Taurus Sign (Rishaba) is governed by Venus (Sukra); and
so on. This is common to both the Western and the Hindus systems. But, after
discovering Uranus and Neptune, the Westerners have allotted Aquarius (Kumba)
to Uranus and Pisces (Meena) to Neptune. The Hindus did not include this
allocation. As regards the Nakshathras, the first division commencing from
Aries (Mesha) 0 is Aswini ruled by Kethu; the second is called Bharani governed
by Venus; the third star is Karthikai ruled by Sun: the fourth Rohini, lord of
which is Moon and so on. (It is given in a tabulated form in the text
Krishnamurti Padhdhati.) </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Day: The Hindus consider that a day
commences only from the moment of the Sunrise in that locality and that it
extends till the next sunrise in the same locality. The Sun may rise at 4-30 AM
or 5 A.M. or 7-40 A.M. If a child is born at 7-20 A.M. and the Sun rises only
7-40 A.M. to that locality on that day, then the child is said to have been bom
on the previous day. Suppose the Sun rises at 4-50 A.M. and a child is born at
5-10 A.M. the Hindus consider that it is born on the next day. They take the lord
of the next day for judgment and predict. This is very important when the
Hindus elect certain auspicious day to undertake any project. As we follow
civil date, date changes at 12 midnight. But for Hindus Sunrise to Sunrise is a
day, though, date changes at 12 midnight. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Horoscope: While erecting a horoscope
and offering prediction the Hindus attach much importance to the signs, houses
and Navamsa position of the planets. But, the Wester ners attach importance to
the signs and houses They have no "Navamsa" chart at all. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. The Houses, ie. bhavas: Differ widely
between Eastern and Western system of calculation. Westerners calculate the
houses from cusp to cusp, whereas the Hindus take the cusp as the midpoint of
the house and call the House as Bhava. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Prediction-Ududasa: Vimshothari,
Ashtothari, Kalachakra dasa, etc., are the various dasas advocated by the Hindu
sages to predict events in one's life either to himself or to his relatives or
others, with whom he or she has or has no transaction at all. The Westerners
have no daut system at all </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. Progression: There is no clear and
exhaustive method of “Progression”given by the Hindu sages though it is simply
mentioned by only one sage. Westerners follow this method to predict events in
one's life and have advanced much in Progression. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. Transit: Westerners take the position of
Sun in the Sayana chart to offer transit results. The Sayana position of the
transitting planets is referred to the position of Sun at birth. But the Hindus
take the Nirayana position of the transitting planets and refer to the radical
Narayana position of Moon in the horoscope. Further, the Hindus give the
results according to the Sign occupied by the transitting planets and not the
Houses (or Bhavas) transitted by them; but the Westerner's take into consideration
both the signs and the houses transitted by the various planets and the exact
longitudinal distance. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">9. Aspects: The Hindus are of opinion that
all planets aspect the 7th house whereas Saturn has also special glance on the
3rd and 10th houses counted from the sign occupied by it; Jupiter aspects 5th
and 9th houses from its position: Mar, aspects 4th and 8th houses, counted from
the sign it occupieds other than the 7th. But the aspects followed by the
Westerners are calculated correctly. They call that the longtitude between one
planet and another planet or one planet and the cusp of one house. if divisible
by 221, the aspect is disharmonius, harmful and adverse. Also, they say
"If the longitudinal distance among two plancts. or between one planet and
the cusp of another house, is divisible by 18 or 30 (except 90</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> and 150</span>°<span lang="EN-US">) is considered to be harmonious,
favourable and advantageous. "They do not count sign to sign, as Hindus
do; but they take the exact relative position. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10. Parents: Westerners consider that the
fourth house indicates father and the 10th house the mother. But the Hindus
take the fourth house as the mother of the person and the 9th house as the
father. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11. Strength: Hindus estimate the strength
of the planets by Shadbula, etc., after laborious work whereas the method
adopted by the Westerners is very simple and they do not have any such
calculation. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12. Ashtaka varga: Is a method followed by
the Hindus which is not known to the ancient astrologers of the West. This
method is useless especially in Twin Birth Charts or to those born to different
mothers within short interval. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, many instances can be given to show
that the Westerners and Hindus follow their own system which are absolutely
different. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Why both the methods are considered to be
incomplete, and the Hindu System is confusing and contradicting needs no
explanation. But one has to understand. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) How to ascertain the favourable and the
unfavour able disposition of planets. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) What nature of results a planet
indicates. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) The exact time when they will be
experienced. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(4) To predict the different results
enjoyed by twins born in the same locality, but with an interval of few minutes
even though the ascendant (lagna) is in the same sign, the position of planets
in the Zodiac in the sign and in Navamsa chart remains the same as well as the
dasa and bhukti are more or less same. As per progression the aspect among the
planets will also be similar in the horoscopes of people born within short
interval </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, it would be a problem both For Hindus
and Westerners (i) to estimate the longevity of cach, as in some cases, either
of the twins passes away carly in infancy and the other lives along. (ii) one
gets married, the other remains unmarried, (iii) one has sterling character
whereas the other is always after the opposite sex, (iv) one has children, the
other has to adopt, (V) one enters Government service, the other takes up
business; (vi) one is a lawyer, the other is a surgeon, and so on. The common
aspects are the same mother, father, uncle, aunt, etc. But the number of
brothers and sisters will vary in those instances where one of the twins is a
male and the other a female. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Astrology can be declared a science, only
when these differences can be explained properly, at least after knowing the
results. It will be considered to be a perfect science, if it is made easy and
the students having the ardent desire, understand it thoroughly, apply it
properly and offer correct predictions. Herein came the need for research. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By the Divine Grace, research was
successful. Some truths are discovered. Later, after convincing my own
conscience, from 1951 I began to teach my technique to many students (who are
already learned). I am happy that God has given me health to tour throughout
India and coach up hundreds of students every year. Everybody knows that I am
the only astrologer doing this service. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also, a number of astrologers at Junnar,
Poona, Kirkee, Kolhapur, Sholapur and Ahmednagar wanted me to deliver series of
lectures, daily, for 15 days and I did. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A few came from Bombay to Delhi, stayed for
months and attended lectures at Delhi. A few from Singapore. Kasipet, Busawal
and other places stayed in my residence and learnt. Most of the disciples
unlearnt what all they learnt prior to my lectures, thoroughly understood my
technique. Just like a number of parallel mirrors, reflect many images, and the
images are seen to infinite distance, so also they make use of Krishna- murti
Padhdhati, confirmed to be simple and supreme and spread this technique. They
have declared that this is the best and correct method to foretell and satisfy
the consultant as it enables one to offer precise predictions, even in the
cases of twins born at an interval of only a few minutes. It is convincing,
clear and very correct, that is what they say. There is no use for the word
"Likely, Probably" etc. Tendency is used only by those people who
cannot offer definite predictions. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If this book is studied, one will say after
studying once "Aham Na Pandithaha". A second reading will give him
courage and confidence to say "Aham Cha Pandithaha". If a third
reading is given, people will say that the astrologer who had read thrice this
book can declare himself "Aham Eva Pandithaha". </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This book is an eye-opener, It is a
corrective one. It does not accept incorrect dicta. The expression is lucid;
idens are clear; arguments are convincing; the results are correct. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All these are due to God's Grace whom I bow
down again and again. [Uchchista Maha Ganapathi.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The authorities of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan
realised the truth in my technique. They were fully convinced, as many uncanny
predictions given during the lecture, came correct and they were happy to hear
the scientific explanation and to see that it came true. That is why, Governor
of Bombay Dr. P. V. Cherian conferred the title "Jyothish Marthand"
and presented a Gold Medal in a convocation at Bombay to the author. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Next it is my duty to thank those who were
helpful to me to improve the knowledge in this science, to assist in my
research and to bring out this text-book. Let me first thank Kulapati Munshiji
&amp; or having appointed me as a Visiting Professor of Astrology in India to
deliver lectures at Delhi, Bombay and Madras regularly and occasionally in
other kendhras. Improvement of knowledge is mainly due to the most intelligent
students (aged between 25 and 65) who would be requiring me to answer varieties
of questions, and to clarify various doubts left unsolved, so far. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let me thank Sri K. Ganapathi, my eldest
son, working in State Bank, Madras who had assisted me in every aspect,
deserves appreciation and my heartfelt thanks. So also, I thank Mr. Bala,
Delhi, for his co-operation and assistance. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Finally, I thank God so that this seience
may be developed further by the readers to give amazing, astonishing, but
accurate prediction. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My final prayer to God is that this science
may be used only to find auspicious time for celebration of marriage, admission
in schools and colleges, construction of mansions, purchase of car, jewels,
etc., admission of expectant mother in nursing home, opening account in a bank,
etc., that all of us may be so happy and prosperous that astrology finds no
necessity to offer mental solace, as I pray that everybody should be crowned
with success. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Peace, Pleasure and Prosperity be to all of
us.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">K. S.
