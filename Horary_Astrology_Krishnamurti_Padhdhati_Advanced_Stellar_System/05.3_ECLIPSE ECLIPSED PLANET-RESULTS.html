<body><h2 id="heading_05.3_ECLIPSE ECLIPSED PLANET-RESULTS_0"><span lang="EN-US">ECLIPSE ECLIPSED PLANET-RESULTS</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If any heavenly body intercepts the light
of another heavenly body and the onlooker is unable to see the farther off
planet it is said to be eclipsed. The nearer planet deprives the light of the
more distant planet. Its brilliance, the circular shape and splendour will be
lost.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the Solar system, Sun is taken as the
Central body around which the planets move round and round. Each planet has its
own orbit-its own pathway round the Sun. But the earth and the Moon go round
the Sun, together. The one feature of Moon which is about 2,40,000 miles away
from the earth goes round the earth once in 27</span>（<span lang="EN-US">1/2</span>）<span lang="EN-US">days and both Moon and earth go round the Sun once a year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury and Venus are very near Sun. Sun is
93 million miles away from the earth. Mercury is 36 millions miles away from
Sun: Venus is 67 million miles away from the Sun. Therefore, there will be
occasions when Moon, Mercury and Venus can come between the earth and the Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose you keep one of your fingers near
either of your eyes. Close the other eye. One elephant standing 100 yards, away
is hidden by this small finger. This depends on the size of the finger, its
nearness to the eye and the farther distance of the elephant. Now, your eye,
the finger and the elephant are in the same line and plane. Suppose, the
elephant is lifted by a lift, in the same place. Even though the elephant was
hidden by the finger previously, as it is lifted up above the area covered by
the finger, then the elephant becomes visible, slowly and steadily.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus Moon is a decently big body. It is
very near to the earth. The Sun is very far off. It is very big like the
elephant compared with finger. So, when the Moon comes in between the observer
and the Sun, the Sun is not visible. Slowly the shadow of the Moon, covers the
Sun. This is called the Solar eclipse. During the duration of the eclipse the
declination of the Moon and Sun will be the same. But if the declination is
different, but the celestial longitude of both is the same then it is only New
Moon. Similarly, when earth comes hetween Moon and Sun, earth prevents Moon
from getting the light of the Sun, and lunar eclipse is formed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Just like, during Solar eclipse, Sun loses
its brilliance and is hidden by Moon, and during lunar eclipse Moon loses its
pleasant light and is hidden by the earth, so also the rays of other planets
are interrupted. Because, we, on the earth, do not receive very bright light,
illuminating the objects on the earth, from other planets, we cannot see,
notice and realise the eclipse of the other planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The planets Mercury and Venus are called
Inferior planets as they are nearer to Sun than the earth and they can be
between the Sun and the Earth, just like Moon during New Moon days and Solar
eclipse days. Moon is hidden from Sun by the earth during lunar eclipse. But
earth can never come in between Mercury and Sun or in between Venus and Sun.
Because, Sun is the Centre. From Sun, Mercury is 36 million miles away. Venus
is 67 million miles from Sun. The distance between Sun and Earth is 92 million
miles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The other planets are called the superior
planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Westerners give importance only to the
Solar and Lunar eclipse. They do not attach much importance to the conjunction
of Sun with other planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hindus pay much attention to the eclipse of
the planets while they predict results of those planets in their dasas and
bhukties, while giving transit results how a planet getting eclipsed will
behave and also while selecting an auspicious time to celebrate marriage, or
entry into a new house or for learning vedas, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hindus are of opinion that the eclipsed
planet, whether a benefic or a malefic. loses its strength especially to do
good to the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Jataka Thatvam, Mahadeva says that the
planet that is eclipsed will cause trouble and produce untoward results. In
Sanketanidhi, Ramadayalu has said that if Mars and Venus are eclipsed and
occupy the 5th house, the person concerned becomes one-eyed and if the lord of
the rising dwadasamsa is eclipsed, the person's property is insecure, he also
says that the lord of the rising Trimsamsa when eclipsed causes
misunderstanding among the relatives.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Kalidas is of the opinion that if the lord
of a Bhava is eclipsed by the Sun's rays, the Bhava is completely destroyed
even if the Bhava is occupied by benefics. In his work Uttara Kalamirtham, he
adds that Venus and Saturn do not lose strength even when eclipsed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Prithuyasas, son of Varahamihira, deals a
little elaborately in his work Horasara, with the results of the eclipsed
planets. Even though the planets may be strong by occupying a position in the
Zodiac, yet they become weak if they are eclipsed by the Sun and hence they do
not produce the good effects which are declared to fructify in their dasa
periods, yogas and their bhavas. However strong a planet may be, still it will
not produce any good effect if it is eclipsed, and during its dasa, results
will be bad. It will apply to the results of the Bhava it owns and also
occupies. He also mentions that planets, excepting Venus and Saturn, lose half
of their strength when eclipsed. If the Moon becomes eclipsed, the native will
have a fall from his position, will be mentally afflicted, and will suffer from
jaundice and similar diseases. Further, there will be risk from water.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars, when eclipsed, will give trouble and
many kinds of worries, and the native's mind will be in a destructive mood.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury when eclipsed, brings loss through
lands and perpetual mental affliction. He will suffer from jaundice, sickness,
catarrh, etc. He will also incur loss.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Eclipsed Jupiter gives misery and happiness
in equal proportion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn in eclipsed state shows that the
person's income and expenditure will balance each other. He will not feel
happy. He will have a frail body. But his fame will spread very wide. He will
be tormented by various mental cares.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Prithuyasas also mentions that one's
education will be spoiled in the period of a planet occupying the navamsa sign
owned by the eclipsed one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When longevity is calculated, the Hindu
sages declare that one born during the period of eclipse is very short-lived.
If the lords of the lagna, navamsa lagna and Moon rasi are all eclipsed, the
person cannot live long.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">While the strength of the eclipsed planet
is discussed, Varahamihira says in Brihat Jataka that planets, when eclipsed,
contribute only one half of what longevity they can give in the same position
in the Zodiac, if they are not eclipsed. But Mantreswara in Phaladeepika writes
that the strength of an eclipsed planet is nil and a person will meet with his
end in its dasa within a short time after it starts. Destruction to the members
of the family and wealth is threatened. He will have litigation and may suffer
humiliation. He says that the eclipsed</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">planet ruling the 7th house shows loss of
wife; lord of 5 denotes danger to children and lord of lagna will cause death
to the native. If the planet is not eclipsed, good effect of the bhava will be
enjoyed. All will welcome the lord of 6 to be eclipsed as it is strong to
destroy the enemies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><h3 id="heading_05.3_ECLIPSE ECLIPSED PLANET-RESULTS_1"><span lang="EN-US">Correct interpretation K. P</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">[What eclipsed planet can do in its period
or sub-period.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let us consider the results of the planets
situated in the constellation of those which are eclipsed and what they
signify. If a planet is deposited in the constellation of an eclipsed one and
if it is the sub-lord of the lagna cusp, the sub-lord shows that the native
will be imprisoned; he will lead the life in cognito; will suffer from fear,
disease and anxiety, will participate in funeral rites; incur loss and may lose
position too, will be unfortunate, etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 2nd cusp: Behaves stupidly in a
public assembly, will be untrustworthy, will receive annoying letters, write
bad ones or anonymous ones suffer from eye troubles, will be foul-tongued,
spend heavily, incur royal displeasure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 3rd cusp: Demise of brother,
evil advice, trouble through secret mechanisation of internal enemies,
humiliation, discomfixture and loss of pride thereby.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 4th cusp: Distress to mother,
sickness to dear friends, danger to building, trouble due to the loss of
cattle, danger from water and conveyance.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 5th cusp: Loss of a child,
aberration of the mind, deception, wearisome, wandering, trouble in the
stomach, displeasure of the Government and bodily weakness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 6th cusp: Will have troubles
through thieves, will suffer reverse, defeat, will commit wicked acts, will do
servile duties, will be despised, scandalised and injured.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 7th cusp: Distress to
son-in-law, separation from beloved, untoward results due to the troubles from
the opposite sex, intrigues with wicked women, diseases in the private parts,
ever wandering.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 8th cusp: Excessive sorrow:
want of sense, carnal appetite, jealousy, unconsciousness, poverty, fruitless
rambling, sickness, humiliation and death.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 9th cusp: Will incur the wrath
of the deity or Guru or preceptor or father suffer something untoward, trouble
to wife and children, will do wicked acts, elder's demise, will suffer from
poverty.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 10th cusp: Fruitless attempts,
loss of honour, will become wicked, leave his permanent place, inauspicious
happenings, will lead bad life, suffer troubles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 11th cusp: Bad news, trouble to
elder brother, sickness to children, will suffer misery, deception and ear
disease. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sub lord of 12th cusp: Various diseases,
dishonour, disappearance of wealth, detention, bondage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These results will be experienced by a
person when he runs the dasa, bhukti or anthra of the sub lord as mentioned
above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mantreswara gives hopes by saying that a
planet, even when eclipsed, if it occupies an auspicious sign and Navamsa,
will, in its period, offer mixed results and finally in the latter half at its
dasa, agreeable and beneficial results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Transit results of eclipsed planets:
Planets in their transit through favourable houses (houses, constellations and
subs wherein they have to give good effects) become void of effect if they
happen to be eclipsed. But if the houses transitted by them be unfavourable,
then they will give bad effects in an aggravated form.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Election of auspicious time for any
undertaking: Avoid the constellation in which the recent eclipses have appeared
within six months before and after the month when one desires to do any
auspicious work,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is also declared that it is not
advisable to celebrate Upanayanam or marriage or construct a building or enter
into new premises when Jupiter and Venus are eclipsed. It is called Guru, Sukra
Moodam or Moudyam or Asthamanam".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">People belonging to Sama Veda should not
initiate mantra and do Upanayana when Mars is eclipsed. Rig Veda people should
avoid these when Jupiter is eclipsed. If Venus is eclipsed, Yajur Veda people
should not have Upanayanam.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Westerners are of opinion that the
conjunction of Sun and Moon is highly conducive to promote material welfare and
to have bright careers from the time of conjunction. Sun and Mars in close
conjunction give force of character and power of endurance. Great self-control
is to be exercised. There will be struggle between one's will and desires
during one's life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun and Mercury in close conjunction give
much mental ability, with a clear thinking of high order. It gives
adaptability. One will have reasoning ability, memory and fluency of speech.
The greasest orators, chief engineers, famous accountants and auditors are
having Sun and Mercury in the same longitude (degree and minute) when it is
combust. Only a few are perverted and dogmatic depending on the sub-lord (K. P.
explains it).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun in conjunction with Jupiter makes one a
scholar. He will maintain good health, enjoy mental equilibrium and have
professional advancement. New undertakings will prosper and constructive
ability will be strengthened.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Conjunction of Sun and Venus shows
popularity and social success. He will acquire competence in music, art,
poetry, wrestling etc. He will gain through the other sex. Marriage will give
continuous happiness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Conjunction of Saturn and Sun gives
indomitable will, courage and strength of intellect. It does not promote
material. happiness. IIl-health and obstacles delay one's advancement in life.
But it brings lot of power, authority and responsibility if Saturn receives
good aspects from benefits. (One may become sanyasi.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus Westerners have taken each planet,
observed the results and have recorded them. Those who are interested to do
research can take the horoscope of those in whom a few planets are eclipsed and
observe the various results enjoyed by them during the dasa of the eclipsed
planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Stellar Astrological Research Institute,
Madras, verified various charts and found out that the eclipsed planets give
both good and bad results in their dasas, depending upon the Bhuktinathas,
i.c., a person born in Dhanur lagna having Mercury eclipsed, had his marriage
and prosperity in his profession during Mercury Dasa. As lord of 7, it gave
marriage, and as lord of 10 gave promotion. A person born in Vrischika Lagna
with Moon in Vrischika had Venus eclipsed at the time of his birth. He had his
wedding in Venus Dasa and he enjoyed his married life. He also invested money
on luxurious articles, jewels and furniture. Thus one can see that the planet
when eclipsed does not become a malefic and deny the results which it has to
offer.</span></p><span lang="EN-US"><br clear="all"/>
