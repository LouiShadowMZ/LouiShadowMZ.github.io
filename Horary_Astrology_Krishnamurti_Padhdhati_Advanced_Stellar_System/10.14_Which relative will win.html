</table><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus Dasa balance 17 years 10 months 13
days. Competition, cards, game, speculation, races, lottery are all speculative
ones, bringing casual income not to be taxed even. Such an attempt will be made
during the period of a planet connected with 5th house, counted from the lagna.
If the query is for younger sister or brother, take the 3rd house counted from
Horary lagna as the Ascendant for that youngster. If the query relates to
mother, take the fourth house. If it refers to children take the 5th as lagna
to children. To wife take 7th, to father take 9th and to elder brother or
sister take the 11th and find out.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2, 6 and 11th houses are to be judged. Any
of the significators should have connection with 5th also.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2nd house is occupied by Moon, Sun and Mercury.
No planet is in the stars of these three. These 3 planets, sub periods are to
improve bank position.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6th house is occupied by Rahu. None is in
its star. During Rahu sub periods one can gain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house is unoccupied. Lord is Sun. It
will do good in its period. The query is whether he can gain in the end of
February 1968. At that time, Venus in lagna bhava, in the constellation of
Saturn in 5th house and sub of Saturn operates. As the sub lord is advantageous
to the opponent, you cannot win. The sub period lord is Venus: sub sub will be
ruled by Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the opponent is shown by the 7th house
and wife is also indicated by the 7th, one may ask why one should not buy on
wife's name.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">True. But one should know, how to
differentiate between wife, partner in business, second issue, father's elder
brother etc., as 7th house indicates all these relates.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Horary Lagna is in Venus sign Jupiter
star Jupiter sub. The querist is born in Libra and Rasi Aquarius, star
Poorva-bhadra is governed by Jupiter, Hence the lagna indicates the person.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The seventh cusp (navamsa) is at 20 of
Aries. It is ruled by Mars (lord of lagna) Venus (lord of star), Rahu, lord of
sub. This indicates that such a relative or partner in business or second child
and so on, whose ruling planets are Mars. Venus and Rahu can gain, i.c. they
should be the lord of the day, star, rasi and lagna. If the wife's ruling
planets agree, purchase on her name. If it agrees with that of your partner,
ask him to buy. If the second son's ruling planets agree, buy on his name. If
none of these agree, none of you will gain. Some stranger will win.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly consider the planets signifying
3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th and 11th houses. If that relation's ruling planets at the
time of birth agrees, that relative can win.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is the only way to eliminate others
and select that particular relation, even though the same house indicates many
relations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To me, it appeals that the mother will
gain. Why? It is not because the ruling planets agree.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But let us judge.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second house counted from 4th is occupied
by Saturn: 4th house is owned by Saturn: It is in the constellation of Saturn
and sub of Mars, lord of 11 to 4.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sixth house is unoccupied. It is owned by
Mercury. No planet is in its star. Mercury is a benefic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th house is occupied by Sun, Moon and
Mercury. None in their stars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is lord of 5 and 10 in 10th bhava in
the star of planet in 2 and sub of Saturn in 2 and lord of 2.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence Venus gives the mind to speculate.
Saturn in the 2nd to the 4th house indicating lagna of mother shows increase in
income. If one wins, the cash can be had, a few days later. Hence, it will be
the sub period of Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Therefore predict that mother will gain.
Luckily 4th house does not indicate other relations. According to Westerners it
indicates father. But I take 4th house to denote mother and 9th house for
father, because lagna is the 5th from the 9th and everybody will be proud of
saying that he or she is the son or daugher of the father:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Take your mother to races on the day when
the star is Anuradha or Dhanishta. Let her buy a ticket. She must gain. So also
for lottery etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
