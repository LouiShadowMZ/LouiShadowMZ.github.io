<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-15">BONATTI’S DECISION TREE: <br/>WHETHER THINGS LOST WILL BE FOUND</p>
<p class="txni">Guido Bonatti devotes chapter 13 of his <span class="ital">Treatise 6: On Questions</span> (translated by Dykes) to whether the querent will be able to find a lost object. The following is a list of the principles that Bonatti follows. Essentially these guidelines act like a decision tree that enables Bonatti to decide whether an object is likely to be found, and how quickly and easily. Each successive principle represents the decreasing likelihood and increasing difficulty and angst for the querent in finding the lost object. It is important to remember that the following are <span class="ital">guidelines</span> and not infallible rules of science.</p>
<p class="list1">• If <span class="ital">both</span> the Ascendant ruler and the Moon (co-ruler of the querent) apply by conjunction or aspect to the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house (the querent’s goods), then the missing item will be found quickly and with little effort.</p>
<p class="list2">• If <span class="ital">either</span> the Ascendant ruler <span class="ital">or</span> the Moon (co-ruler of the querent), but not both, applies to the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house (the querent’s goods), then the thing will be found but not so quickly and with more effort.</p>
<p class="list2">• <span class="ital">Transfer of light</span>. If <span class="ital">neither</span> the Ascendant ruler <span class="ital">nor</span> the Moon (co-ruler of the querent) applies to the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house (the querent’s goods) but another planet <span class="ital">transfers the light</span> of one of the querent’s rulers to the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler, then the thing will be found.</p>
<p class="list2">• <span class="ital">Collection of light.</span> If <span class="ital">neither</span> the Ascendant ruler <span class="ital">nor</span> the Moon (co-ruler of the querent) applies to the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house (the querent’s goods) and there is no <span class="ital">transfer of light</span> from one of the querent’s rulers to the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler, then check to see if there be a planet heavier than the Ascendant ruler and the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler to whom <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page90" title="90"></span>the rulers of the querent and the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> apply. If this planet receives the light of both, then the missing thing will be found.</p>
<p class="list2">• If the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house (the querent’s goods) lies in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, or forms a trine or sextile aspect to it, then the thing will be found after some time has passed and with complications. In addition, the querent will experience worry and upset in the process. [I don’t know whether Bonatti means an aspect to the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house or a Whole Sign aspect between houses.]</p>
<p class="list2">• If the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house (the querent’s goods) does not lie in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house but there is another planet in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, and the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> is joined to this other plane<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> by conjunction or aspect, then the thing will be found but with much delay and stress for the querent. [Bonatti does not specify that the aspect must be a sextile or trine, a<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> in the previous rule, but I assume that is what he had in mind.]</p>
<p class="list3">• If none of the above conditions apply, then the missing object will not be found.</p>
<p class="tx">In the above guidelines, Bonatti is clearly using the ruler of the Ascendant and the Moon to signify the querent, and the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house to signify the missing possession. In this same chapter, he next discusses the <span class="ital">ruler of the 8</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">th</span><span class="ital"> house</span>, which he takes to <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>ignify the querent’s missing object after it has fallen into the hands of another person (7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house), who is possibly but not necessarily a thief. Thus, if someone else has come into possession of the querent’s missing goods, the following guidelines (briefly summarized) apply:</p>
<p class="list1">• If the ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> is joined to the ruler of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (another person), then the querent will not recover his goods because someone else has taken possession of them.</p>
<p class="list2">• If the ruler of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (the other person) is joined to the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> (the querent’s goods), and neither the Ascendant ruler nor the Moon is joined to the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> hous<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">r</span>uler, then the querent will <span class="ital">not</span> recover his goods. If the querent’s rulers, however, ar<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> mixed up in this configuration, then litigation may be needed to recover the missing items.</p>
<p class="list2">• If the ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> applies to the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, it shows that the object in the possession of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house person is returning to the possession of the querent.</p>
<p class="list3">• If the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> (the querent’s goods) has joined to the ruler of the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> or the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, or to a planet in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> or the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, or occupies the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> or the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, then the other party (7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house) has transported the missing item to a distant location, perhaps even to another country.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page91" title="91"></span>Finally, Bonatti gives a couple general rules about whether missing objects will be found:</p>
<p class="list1">• If the Sun and the Moon are both below the horizon at the time of the question or at the time the object went missing, then it will not be recovered and the querent will never learn what happened. [Grain-of-salt warning: Lilly also uses this guideline, but I have certainly seen horary charts with the Sun and Moon below the horizon in cases where the item was later found.]</p>
<p class="list2">• If the Ascendant ruler and the Moon are both in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house, and the Sun aspects them by sextile or trine, then the missing object will be found on the same day. If the Sun aspects them by square, it will take a week. If the Sun aspects them by opposition, it will take a month until recovery.</p>
