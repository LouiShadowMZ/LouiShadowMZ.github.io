<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-10">LILLY: BRINGING MATTERS <br/>TO PERFECTION</p>
<p class="txni">In chapter XXI of <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span>, Lilly explains how to determine if a matter will be “brought to perfection.” </p>
<p class="Q1">To know whether a thing demanded will be brought to perfection yea or nay.</p>
<p class="Q2">The Ancients have delivered unto us, that there are four ways or means, which discover whether one question or the thing demanded shall be accomplished yea or not. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 124–125)</p>
<p class="Ahead">Conjunction</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">First, by Conjunction; when as therefore you find the Lord of the Ascendant, and Lord of that house which signifies the thing demanded, hastening to a Conjunction, and in the first house, or in any Angle, and the significators meet with no Prohibition or Refrenation, before they come to perfect Conjunction; you may then judge, that the thing sought after, shall be brought to pass without any manner of let or impediment, the sooner, if the Significators be in swift motion, and Essentially or Accidentally strong; but if this Conjunction of the Significators be in a Succedent house, it will be perfected, but not as soon: if in Cadent houses, with infinite loss of time, some difficulty, and much struggling. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 125)</p>
<p class="Ahead">Aspect of Sextile or Trine</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Things are also brought to pass, when as the principal signifiers apply by Sextile or <span class="CharOverride-4">T</span>rine aspect out of good Houses and places where they are essentially well dignified (and meet with no malevolent Aspect to intervene are they come to be in per<span class="CharOverride-4">f</span>ect Sextile or Trifle; I mean to the partile Sextile or Trine.) (<span class="ital">CA</span> 125)</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page64" title="64"></span>Aspects of Square and Opposition</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Things are also produced to perfection, when the Significators apply by Square aspect, provided each Planet have dignity in the Degrees wherein they are, and <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>pply out of proper and good Houses, otherwise not. Sometimes it happens, that a matter is brought to pass when the Significators have applied by Opposition, but it hath been, when there hath been mutual reception by House, and out of friendly Houses, and the Moon separating from the Significator of the thing demanded; I have rarely seen anything brought to perfection by this way of opposition; but the Querent had been better the thing had been undone; for if the Question was concerning Marriage, the parties seldom agreed, but were ever wrangling and jangling, each party repining at his evil choice, laying the blame upon their covetous Parents<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> as having no mind to it themselves: and if the Question was about Portion or Monies, the Querent did, it’s true, recover his Money or Portion promised, but it cost him more to procure it in suit of Law, then the debt was worth, &amp;c. and so have I seen it happen in many other things, &amp;c. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 125)</p>
<p class="Ahead">Translation (Transfer) of Light and Nature</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">Things are brought to perfection by Translation of Light and Nature, in this manner. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 125)</p>
<p class="Q2">When the Significators both of Querent and Quesited are separated from Conjunction or Sextile or Trine aspect of each other, and some one Planet or other doth separate himself from one of the Significators, of whom he is received either by House [domicile], Triplicity, or Term, and then this Planet doth apply to the other Significator by Conjunction or aspect, before he meets, with the Conjunction o<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> aspect of any other Planet, he then translates the force, influence and virtue of the first Significator to the other, and then this intervening Planet (or such a man or woman as is signifies by that Planet) shall bring the matter in hand to perfection. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 126)</p>
<p class="Q3">Consider what house the Planet interposing or translating the nature and light of the two Planets is Lord of, and describe him or her, and say to the party, that such a party shall do good in the business of, &amp;c. viz., if Lord of the second, a good Purse affects the matter; if Lord of the third, a Kinsman or Neighbor; and so of all the rest of the Houses: of which more shall be said in the following Judgments. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 126)</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page65" title="65"></span>Lilly defines translation as follows: </p>
<p class="Q4">Translation of light and nature is, when a light Planet separates from a more weighty one, and presently joins to another more heavy. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 111)</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly implies that the Moon must be simultaneously within orb of the two planets involved in the translation of light. Some traditional authors require that the Moon be received by the planet whose light it wishes to translate so that the planet can hand over its light to the Moon, but Lilly does not appear to share this view.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Collection of Light</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Matters are also brought to perfection, when as the two principal Significators do not behold one another, but both cast their several Aspects to a more weighty Planet then themselves, and they both receive him in some of their essential dignities; then shall <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hat Planet who thus collects both their Lights, bring the thing demanded to perfec<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ion: which signifies no more in Art then this, that a Person somewhat interested in both parties and described and signified by that Planet, shall perform, effect and co<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span>clude the thing which otherwayes could not be perfected: As many times you see two fall at variance, and of themselves cannot think of any way of accommodation, when suddenly a Neighbour or friend accidently reconciles all differences, to the content of both parties: And this is called Collection. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 126)</p>
<p class="Ahead">Dwelling of Planets in Houses Plus <br/>Translation of Light by the Moon</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">Lastly, things are sometimes perfected by the dwelling of Planets in houses, viz., when the Significator of the thing demanded is casually posited in the Ascendant; as if one demand if he shall obtain such a Place or Dignity, if then the Lord of the tenth be placed in the Ascendant, he shall obtain the Benefit, Office, Place or Honour desired: This rule of the Ancients holds not true, or is consentaneous to reason: except they will admit, that when the Moon, besides this dwelling in house, doth transfer the light of the Significator of the thing desired, to the Lord of the Ascendant; for it was well observed that the application of the Significators shew inclination of the parties, but separation usually privation; that is, in more plain terms, when you see the principal Significators of the Querent, and thing or party quesited after separated, there’s then little hopes of the effecting or perfecting what <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page66" title="66"></span>is desired, (notwithstanding this dwelling in houses) but if there be application, the parties seem willing, and the matter is yet kept on foot, and there is great probability of perfecting it, or that things will come to a further treaty. In all Questions you are generally to observe this Method following. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 126–127)</p>
<p class="Q2">As the Ascendant represents the person of the Querent, and the second his Estate, the third his Kindred, the fourth his Father, the fifth his Children, the sixth his Servant or Sickness, the seventh his Wife, the eighth the manner of his Death, the ninth his Religion or journeys, the tenth his Estimation or honour, the eleventh his Friends, the twelfth his secret Enemies. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 127)</p>
<p class="Q2">So you must also understand, that when one asks concerning a Woman or any party signified by the seventh House and the Lord thereof, that then the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House shall be her Ascendant and signify her person, the eighth House shall signify her Estate and be her second, the ninth House shall signify her Brethren and Kindred, the tenth shall represent her Father, the eleventh her Children or whether apt to have Children, the twelfth her Sickness and Servants, the first House her Sweet<span class="CharOverride-4">h</span>eart, the second House her Death, the third her Journey, the fourth her Mother, the fifth her Friends, the sixth her sorrow, care and private Enemies. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 127)</p>
<p class="Q2">Let the Question be of or concerning Churchman, Minister, or the Brother of the wife or sweetheart, the ninth House shall represent each of these, but the tenth House shall be Significator of his Substance, the eleventh House of his Brethren, and so in order: and so in all manner of Questions the House signifying the party shall be his Ascendant or first house, the next his second House, and so continuing round about the whole Heavens or twelve Houses. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 127–128)</p>
<p class="Q2">If a question be made of a King, the tenth is his first house, the eleventh his second, and so orderly: but in Nativities, the Ascendant ever signifies the party born, whether King or Beggar: These things preceding being well understood, you may proceed to judgment; not that it is necessary you have all that is wrote, in your memory exactly, but that you be able to know when you are in an error, when not; when to judge a question, when not: I should also have shewed how to take the Part of Fortune, but that I will do in the first Example, the use of the Part of Fortune being divers, but hardly understood rightly by any author I ever met with: However note, if a King propound an Astrological Question, the Ascendant is for him, as well as for any meaner party; and all the houses in order, as for any vulga<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> person: For Kings are earth, and no more than men; and the time is coming, &amp;c. when. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 128)</p>
