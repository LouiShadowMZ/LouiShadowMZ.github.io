<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-38">TWO CASES OF MONEY GONE MISSING, AND A LOST MANUSCRIPT</p>
<p class="txni">In the first part of this chapter, I will present two cases of money that went missing. The querent in each case was a woman who had a substantial amount of cash that disappeared. Each woman asked a horary question about the location of the missing currency and whether it would be recovered.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Case 1: Will I Find My Money or Is It Lost?</p>
<p class="txni">Sharon Knight, a British astrologer who practices traditional horary, uses only the seven visible planets in her work. Sharon kindly gave permission for me to include a horary that she pos<span class="roman">ted on Skyscript.co.uk. (See the website for a </span>detailed analysis of this chart.) <span class="roman">On</span> Saturday, 9 October 1993, Sharon (the querent) was planning to go shopping, but she had a large amount of money in her pocketbook. She was intending to go to the bank on Monday to deposit the cash, and her mother suggested that she leave the cash at home to avoid losing it or having it stolen. Unfortunately, when it came time to deposit the cash in her bank account on Monday, she forgot where she put it. A thorough search of the house did not produce the missing money.</p>
<p class="tx">On Thursday of the same week, it occurred to her to draw up a horary chart to locate the missing money. The chart was cast for 14 October 1993 at 12:40 p.m. BST in London, a Jupiter day during a Moon hour, Regiomontanus houses (<a href="HA-33.html">Chart 35</a>).</p>
<p class="tx">Sagittarius rises, making Jupiter the ruler of the querent. Sagittarius also rises in Sharon’s natal chart. Jupiter in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is combust the Sun, indicating that the querent experienced fear and distress about the loss and that she could not see clearly what she had done with the money. In addition, Jupiter is the dispositor of the Part of Fortune and thus a co-ruler of the missing money. Jupiter’s placement in the angular 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house suggest<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page258" title="258"></span>that the money is still in her home, but Jupiter’s combustion by the Sun indicates that it is obscured and well hidden from view.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"></a>Chart 35: Sharon Knight: Missing Money <br/>14 October 1993, 12:40 p.m. BST, London. Jupiter day, Moon hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 24<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 36' Gemini<span class="CharOverride-4">.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page259" title="259"></span>The ruler of the Capricorn 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house (her money) is Saturn, which is retrograde and occupies the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house. The fact that the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler is retrograde argues for the return <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>f the missing possession. In discussing the case of a missing horse near Henley, Lilly speaks of the “Lord of the thing lost Retrograde, importing a returning of the thing again casually” and of “Retrograde Planets upon the cusp of the second” showing<span class="ital"> </span>“quick and unexpected recovery”<span class="ital"> </span>(<span class="ital">CA</span> 468).</p>
<p class="tx">Jupiter and Saturn are mutually separating from a trine aspect, showing the querent’s separation from her money. Transiting Jupiter had perfected the trine to transiting Saturn two days earlier, on 12 October 1993 at about 7:30 p.m. GMT. Sharon quotes Lilly to indicate that the loss was due to the forgetfulness of the querent, who was not feeling well on Saturday when the money went missing:</p>
<p class="Q4">Behold from whom the Lord of the ascendant did last separate, and if he did separate from Saturn, the cause of the lost thing was through forgetfulness of the owner, who knows not where he laid it, or it is forgotten by reason of some cold or sickness which afflicted the loser, especially if Saturn be Retrograde. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 321)</span></p>
<p class="tx">The Moon co-rules the querent as well as the missing item. Here the transiting Moon would trine Saturn (ruler of the missing money) and conjoin Jupiter (the querent) o<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> Friday afternoon, 15 October 1993, before leaving its sign. However, the money was not found until Sunday, 17 October 1993, when the transiting Sun perfected a trine to the transiting and horary positions of Saturn during the early morning hours. The Sun then went on to conjoin horary Jupiter at 1:33 p.m. GMT in London. She found the missing cash at 2:45 p.m. GMT. As Sharon says, “The moving Sun conjoined Jupiter on that day and formed its trine to Saturn. The Sun brought the money to light!”</p>
<p class="tx">By following the description of the location given in the chart, the querent was able to find the missing money inside a pair of black boots that she had bought but not worn. She explains: “I had put them back in their box in the very bottom of the wardrobe, on the floor, under a shelf. I got the boots out and there in the ankle/heel part of one of the boots was my money, found at precisely 2.45 p.m. (GMT).” </p>
<p class="Ahead">Jacobson’s Method of Four Significators</p>
<p class="txni">If we apply <span class="ital">Jacobson’s method of four significators</span> to this chart, we find the following:</p>
<p class="list1">1. 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler Saturn is succedent.</p>
<p class="list2">2. Moon is cadent.</p>
<p class="list2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page260" title="260"></span>3. Venus (valuables) is cadent.</p>
<p class="list3">4. Dispositor of the Part of Fortune in Pisces is Jupiter, which is angular. </p>
<p class="tx">An angular significator indicates that the missing object is in the home or in a place where it ought to be.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Case 2: Where Is the Missing Money and Will I Recover It?</p>
<p class="txni">The querent, Ms. P, withdrew five hundred dollars in cash from her bank account and put it in her purse. When she got home from the bank, the money was not there, even though she had not stopped anywhere or gone shopping on the way home. She asked the horary question “Where is the missing money and will I recover it?” at 4:30 p.m. EDT on Friday, 15 May 2015, at 41N17, 73W02 (<a href="HA-33.html">Chart 36</a>). It was a Venus day during a Moon hour.</p>
<p class="tx">Libra rises, making Venus the ruler of the querent. Venus also rules the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of loss and death. Saturn is almuten of the Libra Ascendant and is retrograde and peregrine (without essential dignity).</p>
<p class="tx">The querent’s co-ruler is the Moon in Aries in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. The Moon is not within orb of applying to any Ptolemaic aspect and can be considered void of course.</p>
<p class="tx">The 2nd house cusp in Scorpio makes Mars the ruler of the missing cash. Mars occupies the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of loss and death. Mars is quite afflicted, being peregrine (without essential dignity), under the sunbeams, and in partile opposition to retrograde Saturn in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house.</p>
<p class="tx">Another possible significator of the missing money is Mercury, which disposits the Part of Fortune in Virgo. Mercury lies in the cadent 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house.</p>
<p class="tx">The Ascendant-ruler Venus (the querent) does not apply to aspect 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>-ruler Mars or the dispositor of <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae</span>, Mercury (potential signifiers of the missing cash). The Moon (the querent) does not apply to aspect any other planet in the chart.</p>
<p class="tx">The only possible connection between the significators of the querent and the missing money is the opposition of Saturn (almuten of the Ascendant) and Mars (ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house). Even though Mars and Saturn are in the same numerical degree of their respective signs, they are mutually separating from the perfected aspect, given that Saturn is moving retrograde and Mars is moving forward in the zodiac. The retrograde, peregrine Saturn (a co-ruler of the querent) opposing Mars (the missing money) in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of loss and death suggests that the querent somehow lost the money and that it will not return.</p>

<p class="tx">Mars and Saturn are both peregrine and, as such, are potential indicators of a thief (figure 8). Lilly says that peregrine planets in an angular house or in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of riches can signify a thief. Peregrine Saturn in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house fits these criteria.</p>
<p class="tx">Months later, the querent told me that she never recuperated the missing cash. She suspects that it must have somehow fallen from her purse as she left the bank and made her way to her car in the parking lot for the ride home.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Case 3: A Missing Manuscript</p>
<p class="txni">I included this chart here because of its similarity to the previous case of the missing cash. The querent is a book editor who is also an astrologer. One day a colleague asked him a horary question. His colleague thought he had misplaced a manuscript that he was working on, and he asked his editor friend to cast a horary chart to locate it. Th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> question was asked on 26 July 1990 at 11:39 a.m. CDT, 44N57, 93W06, seven visibl<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> planets only (<a href="HA-33.html">Chart 37</a>).</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"></a>Chart 37: Where Is the Missing Manuscript? <br/>26 July 1990, 11:39 a.m. CDT, St. Paul, MN. Jupiter day, Mercury hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 8<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 12' Capricorn.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page264" title="264"></span>Libra rises, making Venus the querent’s significator, with the Moon as co-significator.</p>
<p class="tx">The querent’s possessions are shown by the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, with Scorpio on the cusp, making Mars the significator of the missing manuscript.</p>
<p class="tx">Venus (the querent) applies to Mars (the missing item) by a favorable sextile, and Mars lies in Taurus, the domicile of Venus. These factors suggest that the querent will find the manuscript. Unfortunately, Mars in Taurus lies in its detriment, because Mars rules th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> opposite sign of Scorpio. In addition, Venus in Cancer lies in the fall of Mars, because Mars is exalted in the opposite sign of Capricorn. In other words, both Venus (the querent) and Mars (the manuscript) occupy signs where Mars feels quite ill at ease, suggesting that the querent may get the manuscript back but it may not be in great condition. </p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"></a>Figure 9: Missing Manuscript: Solar Fire Essential Dignities Report: <br/>Mars “refuses” to help Venus, despite her sextile, because she occupies the sign of his fall.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-4">M</span>edieval astrologers called this type of “reception by debility” relationship between planets <span class="ital">refusal</span>, which in this case implies that Mars will refuse to help Venus (the querent) retrieve the manuscript because she is asking for his help from a place he wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole (figure 9). In contrast, Mars in Taurus, the domicile of Venus, suggests <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page265" title="265"></span>that Venus can be helpful to Mars; however, Venus in Cancer, the fall of Mars, will not receive any help from the red planet because she occupies a sign of his debility. In addition, Mars lies in his detriment in Taurus and is in no condition to help her.</p>
<p class="tx">The question was, however, “Where is the missing manuscript?” Since Mars lies in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, the misplaced item should be in an 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house location. Often, the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house means that the object is “dead” to the querent, lost and gone forever, perhaps out in th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> garbage. Since the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house was important in this chart, I calculated the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house <span class="ital">Part of Death</span> (Ascendant + 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp − Moon), which turned out to be at 9<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 38' Taurus, almos<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> exactly conjunct Mars (the manuscript).</p>
<p class="tx">In this case, the editor learned that the cleaning crew had mistakenly tossed the manuscript in the garbage the night before, rendering it irretrievable. Fortunately, the author of the written manuscript had another copy, but missing forever were some expensive art <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>riginals that were tossed out with the original manuscript.</p>
<p class="Ahead">A Note on Triplicities</p>
<p class="txni">The previous example of the missing manuscript made use of the essential dignities according to Dorotheus of Sidon, a first-century Hellenistic astrologer. Lilly preferred a different system of dignities, which he adopted from a translation of Ptolemy’s <span class="ital">Tetrabiblos</span>, written in the second century CE. The dignities you use in horary can make a difference in how you interpret a chart. </p>
<p class="tx">In Lilly’s version (table 17), each sign has a day triplicity ruler and a night triplicity ruler, depending on the elemental nature of the sign and whether the person was born during the day or at night for natal charts (i.e., whether the Sun was above or below the horizon). </p>

<p class="tx">Ptolemy was not a practicing astrologer, but rather an encyclopedist who was trying to catalogue the known sciences of his day. Most likely Ptolemy was presenting an extant version of the triplicity rulers of his time. Ptolemy may have been working with a variation of the triplicity system presented by Dorotheus of Sidon. </p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page266" title="266"></span>The logic goes something like this. There are four elements: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. Each element is associated with three signs of the zodiac, which make up the triplicities (sets of three signs belonging to an element). There are three complete essential dignities: rulership (domicile), exaltation, and triplicity. Triplicity is third in importance of the essential dignities, after rulership and exaltation.</p>
<p class="tx">Dignity is often likened to the type of respect accorded to important personages or visitors to your realm. The Pope has dignity by domicile in Vatican City. He is the absolute ruler and final arbiter there and his papal authority is not questioned. When the Pope travels to a Catholic country, he is exalted and treated as an honored guest. He generally gets what he wants, but he must abide by the laws of the local government. When the Pope dresses in civilian clothes and visits his family in his home country, he has dignity by triplicity in the dwellings of his extended family. </p>
<p class="tx">The day can be divided into <span class="ital">solar sect</span> planets, which have dignity by day (diurnal), and <span class="ital">lunar sect</span> planets, which have dignity by night (nocturnal). The solar/diurnal planets are the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn (because icy Saturn needs the heat of the day to counteract his coldness and make him behave well). The lunar/nocturnal planets are Venus, the Moon, and Mars (because ardent Mars needs the chill of the night to cool its hot temperament so he can behave well). Mercury can swing either way; he is solar when he rises before the Sun, and lunar when he rises after the Sun.</p>
<p class="tx">The Fire and Air signs have positive/masculine polarity, which goes well with the solar/diurnal sect. The Water and Earth signs have negative/feminine polarity, which goes well with the lunar/nocturnal sect. Dorotheus of Sidon decided to pair the solar planet<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>ith the “positive” Fire and Air triplicities, and the lunar planets with the “negative” Water and Earth triplicities (<a href="HA-33.html">Table 18</a>).</p>

<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page267" title="267"></span>In Dorotheus’s system, each of the three planets ruling a triplicity has dignity and will score points (Lilly’s +3), regardless of whether the native was born during the day or at night. What varies with day or night births is the order of the triplicity rulers. The participating ruler always comes in last. In day charts, the day ruler comes first and the night ruler is second. In night charts, the night ruler comes first and the day ruler is second. All three rulers, however, maintain their dignity as triplicity rulers no matter what time the native came into the world. Presumably, the day ruler is more influential in day charts, the night ruler is more influential in night charts, and the participating ruler is influential regardless of what time the person was born.</p>
<p class="tx">The Dorotheus system was probably the most widely used in medieval astrology. When Ptolemy became popular during the Renaissance, a simplified version of his system came into vogue and was adopted by Lilly. In the seventeenth century, the brilliant French astrologer Morinus (Morin de Villefranche) reviewed the astrological literature and decided that the systems of Ptolemy and Dorotheus were not rational, and he set out to revise them.</p>
<p class="tx">Morin reasoned that the triplicity rulers should be logically consistent with the first two rulerships (domicile and exaltation) and should not be based primarily on solar and lunar sect (day versus night births). All twelve signs already have primary rulers, and seven of the twelve signs are places of exaltation of the seven visible planets. Let’s look at how Morin logically deduced the “true” triplicity rulers:</p>
<p class="tx">The Fire triplicity consists of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius—the domiciles of Mars, the Sun, and Jupiter, respectively. The cardinal sign Aries is ruled by Mars, and the Sun is exalted there. Leo is ruled by the Sun and no planet is exalted there. Hence, the Sun is both a ruler of a Fire sign and is exalted in the Fire triplicity. Because the Sun has both domicile and exaltation in the Fire triplicity, the Sun should be the first (or day) ruler. Because Mars rules Aries, a dominant cardinal sign, Mars should be the second (or night) ruler of the Fire triplicity. Because Jupiter rules the remaining Fire sign, mutable Sagittarius, where nothing is exalted, Jupiter comes last as the participating ruler.</p>
<p class="tx">Applying a similar logic to the remaining triplicities, Morin came up with the following scheme for the triplicities (<a href="HA-33.html">Table 19</a>). He completely dismissed the idea of terms (bounds) and faces of planets within the zodiac signs as superstitious nonsense.</p>

<p class="tx-sa">Morin’s guidelines:</p>
<p class="list1">1. Day rulers have rulership by both domicile and exaltation in the triplicity.</p>
<p class="list2">2. Night rulers have rulership of the cardinal signs of the triplicity.</p>
<p class="list3">3. The participating ruler is the planet that is not exalted in the triplicity and does not rule the cardinal sign of the triplicity, but it does rule one of the three signs of the triplicity.</p>
<p class="tx">Morin’s system is certainly logical and elegant, as he intended, but does it work? The reader will need to experiment with actual charts to decide.</p>
