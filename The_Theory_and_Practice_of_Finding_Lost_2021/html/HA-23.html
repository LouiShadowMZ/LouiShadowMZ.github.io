<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-28">WHERE IS STELLA’S RING?</p>
<p class="txni">My stepmother, Stella, died in a nursing home at age ninety-two and had named me as executor of her estate. I had been visiting her regularly, along with other member<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> of the family, during the period preceding her death. Her sister, who was in her eighties, reminded me that Stella had promised to leave her a ring that had belonged to their mother. In looking through Stella’s belongings, I was unable to find the ring, so I asked the horary question, “Where is Stella’s ring?” on Monday, 6 August 2012, at 10:00 a.m. EDT, 41N17, 73W02 (<a href="HA-23.html">Chart 22</a>).</p>
<p class="tx">I am the querent. Libra rises in the chart, so Venus rules the Ascendant and becomes my significator. Saturn is almuten (the planet with the most essential dignity) at the Ascendant, making Saturn a potential co-ruler for me. Saturn seems more likely, since I am grieving. Also Saturn conjoins 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> ruler Mars in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>, and I am dealing with the death of a loved one<span class="CharOverride-4">.</span> Cancer on the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp is a maternal sign, also suggesting that the chart is radical.</p>
<p class="tx">My stepmother is represented by the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> of fathers). Cancer on the cusp of the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> makes the Moon her significator. Stella’s valuables are indicated by the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> from the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>). Leo rules the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (Stella’s movable goods), and Leo’s ruler (the Sun) occupies the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, so the ring is with Stella’s valuables in a place where she no<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span>mally keeps them. </p>
<p class="tx">The fact that Stella’s ring is still in her possession is also shown by the Moon (Stella’s significator in the angular 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) applying to trine the Sun (the ring) in the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of her possessions (2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> from the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>). The Sun (the ring) applies to sextile Saturn (my co-ruler as almuten of the Ascendant), which suggests that I will find the ring.</p>
<p class="tx">Stella died on a Sunday, and the regular administrator of the nursing home would not be available until Monday. I went to the nursing home on Monday afternoon (the day of the horary question) to meet with the administrator and continue collecting Stella’s things. She told me that each resident of the nursing home had a safe deposit box kept by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page188" title="188"></span>the agency under lock and key. Interestingly, the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is also the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> from the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> of administrators. When we opened the box, there was Stella’s ring in a place where she kept her valuables and where the nursing home kept valuables as well.</p>
<p class="tx">The dispositor of the Part of Fortune can signify the missing item. In this chart, Fortuna in Taurus is disposed by Venus (a natural signifier of adornments) in the dual sign Gemini. It turned out that there were two rings in the safe deposit box, one of which Stella wanted to give to her sister and the other to her niece. Venus in Gemini at the end of the cadent 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) but within 5 degrees of the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp suggested that th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> ring was in the nursing home but in a place that was concealed or hard to find.</p>
<p class="tx">Later in this text, I will discuss planets occupying the degree of the mean lunar nodes representing an event that is fated and beyond the querent’s control. Certainly death i<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> the destiny of all human beings. In this chart, the Ascendant and Mercury occupy a nodal degree. As querent, I am signified by the Ascendant. My assuming the role of executor of Stella’s will could be considered a fated event. Mercury rules the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house in this chart, which both represents my grieving Stella’s loss and rules her derived 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of siblings. Stella’s death led directly to her sister asking about the missing ring. </p>
<p class="tx">In researching this book, I came across a s<span class="roman">imilar chart for the question “Where is my diamond ring?” in Lee </span>Lehman’s book <span class="ital">The Martial Art of Horary Astrology</span> (2002, 117). The question was asked on 25 August 1989 at 10:41 EDT in North Miami, Florida. In this chart, the querent asks about her mother’s ring, but Lehman takes a different approach to analyzing the chart, which you can read in her book. Another approach would have been to view the Cancer 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house as the querent’s mother and the radical 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, with its Leo cusp, as her mother’s possessions. The Sun rules Leo and the missing ring, and its location in the radical 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> suggests that the ring is where the mother normally keeps her valuables, i<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>his case in a safe deposit box. This location is also suggested by the Sun residing in Virgo, a sign that likes to put things neatly into boxes and store them for safekeeping. Just as in Stella’s case, in Lehman’s horary chart, Libra rises and Saturn is almuten of the Ascendant and a co-ruler of the querent. In Lehman’s chart, the Sun (the mother’s ring) applies to trine Saturn (the querent), indicating that the querent will find her mother’s ring, probably in a safe deposit box (Sun in Virgo in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> from the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>).</p>
