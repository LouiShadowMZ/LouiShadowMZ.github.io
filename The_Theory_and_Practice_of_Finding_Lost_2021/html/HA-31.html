<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-36">THE MISSING HEARING AID</p>
<p class="txni">A woman for whom I had done horary charts in the past telephoned to say that she was missing a hearing aid and was unable to find it. She had only recently begun using hearing aids and had spent several thousand dollars on them. The modern technology was amazing; the hearing aids were quite small and were easy to misplace for that reason. Her horary question was this: “Where is my missing hearing aid?” It was asked at 1:01 p.m. EDT on 29 July 2015 at 41N17, 73W02 (chart 33). At the time, my astrology software was set to Placidus houses, and I didn’t bother to switch to Regiomontanus.</p>
<p class="tx">The querent had gone to the gym and from there to her office. After a while at her workplace, she noticed that one of her hearing aids was missing. She went out to the parking lot to look for it in her car, and she retraced her steps from the car to the office. She called the gym, but they could not find the missing hearing aid. Finally, at the end of her lunch break, after not finding the missing item, she called me to consult the stars.</p>
<p class="tx">It is a Mercury day during a Venus hour. According to Dorotheus of Sidon, a first-century Hellenistic astrologer, Venus is the day ruler of the Water triplicity. The Scorpio Ascendant, in the <span class="ital">via combusta,</span> belongs to the Water triplicity. The <span class="ital">via combust</span> Ascendant may mean that she had the misfortune of losing her hearing aid in an obscured location. In addition, Venus is closely sextile the Ascendant.</p>
<p class="tx">Mars rules the Scorpio Ascendant and signifies the querent. In addition, Mars is almuten of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house. (The <span class="ital">almuten</span> of a point in the zodiac is the planet that has the most essential dignity at that point.)</p>
<p class="tx">Mars also rules and is almuten of the 2nd house cusp of possessions and thus signifies the missing hearing aid. The fact that Mars rules both the querent and the missing item suggests that she will find it.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"></a>Chart 33: Missing Hearing Aid <br/>29 July 2015, 1:01 p.m. EDT, 41N17, 73W02. Mercury day, Venus hour. <br/>Placidus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 10<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Scorpio. Early degree rising.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page245" title="245"></span>Sagittarius is intercepted in the 2nd house (Placidus houses), making Jupiter a co-ruler of the hearing aid. Jupiter occupies the public 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, an angular house, which suggests that the hearing aid may be near or at her office and easy to find.</p>
<p class="tx">Saturn in Scorpio on the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house suggests that Saturn may also be a co-ruler of the hearing aid. Saturn is disposed by Mars, and Mars (the querent) and Saturn are mutually applying to a favorable trine, suggesting that she will recover the missing item. Since Saturn rules the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house (vehicles, local travel) and Mars rules the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (hygiene), I suggested that she look carefully in her vehicle (3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house) and in the bathroom at her office (a 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house association). Since Mars occupies the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (a long-distance travel house), the car as a means of transport seemed the more likely possibility. Furthermore, Mars in Cancer in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is disposed by the Moon, which is applying to Pluto in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of local travel.</p>
<p class="tx">The Moon co-rules the querent, and the Moon and Pluto are applying mutually to a conjunction in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of cars. In modern astrology, Pluto is a co-ruler of Scorpio and could potentially rule both the Ascendant and the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp. Traditional astrol<span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>gers would never use Pluto in this way and would probably gasp apoplectically at any sug<span class="CharOverride-4">g</span>estion to do so.</p>
<p class="tx">More significantly, the Moon in Capricorn co-rules the querent and is disposed by Saturn in Scorpio. Saturn, in turn, is disposed by Mars (significator of the querent and the missing item) in Cancer, and Mars in Cancer is disposed by the Moon. This closed loop of dispositors links the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>, 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span>, and 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> houses, again suggesting that the missing hearing aid may be in the querent’s car. This is further suggested by the Ascendant in the<span class="ital"> via combusta</span>, which may refer to the automobile’s <span class="ital">combustion</span> engine. Sometimes astrological symbolism can be quite literal.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, the Moon (co-ruler of the querent) will oppose Mars (ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd </span>house) and then sextile Saturn on the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp before leaving its sign. In addition, Mars (Ascendant ruler) will trine Saturn (3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house ruler, the car) in five degrees and the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp in six degrees, showing a reunion of the querent with the missing item.</p>
<p class="tx">A few hours later, the querent telephoned to say that she had gone out to her car again during her afternoon break and found the missing item in a crease in the fabric where the seat cushion meets the adjustable back of the driver’s seat. She hadn’t seen it the first tim<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>he looked in her car during her lunch break.</p>
<p class="tx">The chart was a bit difficult to interpret, but the preponderance of indications suggested she would find it in the car, which turned out to be the case.</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page246" title="246"></span>Which House Rules Automobiles?</p>
<p class="txni">There is a controversy in the horary literature about which astrological house rules cars. Horary astrologer Alphee Lavoie, for example, feels that the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house signifies all the querent’s movable goods and therefore should be used as the significator of a lost or stolen automobile. In civil law, personal possessions are called “movable property,” meaning anything you own that is movable from one location to another. If something can be moved, it can be lost, misplaced, or stolen.</p>
<p class="tx">Olivia Barclay disagrees with Lavoie’s position and feels that automobiles are ruled by the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house (rather than by the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of movable property), because cars are made for short trips and local travel. By a similar logic, taverns are assigned to the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of <span class="CharOverride-4">f</span>un and merriment rather than to the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> of tenements and landed property. To prove her point, she cites a horary chart about a honey-colored 1937 Bentley in which the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house gives a much more compelling description of the car than does the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house. Unfortunately<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> her logic is flawed, because the querent asks whether he will have enough money to buy the car of his dreams. This is clearly a 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house question about finances, and there is no reason to assume, as Barclay does, that the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house in this horary refers to a car. Sh<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> concludes that the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house signifies the Bentley and shows that the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house does not, but it is obvious from the question that the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house refers to the money needed to buy a car rather than the automobile itself. I tend to agree with Barclay that, in most horar<span class="CharOverride-4">y</span> charts, the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house signifies cars as well as other means of local transportation.</p>
<p class="tx">I have been unable to find any traditional examples of horary questions about a coach, carriage, or cart used for transportation. There may be one buried in the ancient astrological texts that are now being translated. Lilly talks about ships at sea, but he uses the 1st house to represent the ship.</p>
<p class="tx">John Gadbury (1627–1704), a contemporary of William Lilly, wrote about horaries concerning the <span class="ital">safety of a ship at sea</span> (a large ocean-going vehicle). The ancient Arabic and Latin astrologers assigned ships to the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of sea voyages, but Gadbury cites William <span class="CharOverride-4">L</span>illy that a judgment about the <span class="ital">ship’s safety</span> should be made by studying the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house as representative of the ocean vessel. </p>
<p class="tx">Lilly writes about the subject in <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span> in chapter 26, “Of a Ship, and whatever are in her, Her Safety or Destruction”: </p>
<p class="Q4">The <span class="roman">Ancients</span> do put this question to those concerning the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, and I conceive for no other reason, than because it must be granted, that all Ships are made for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page247" title="247"></span>travel and journeys: however, in regard the most part of the judgment concerning its safety or ruin is derived from the Ascendant and his Lord, and the Moon, I thought fit to place this judgment as belonging to the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house. Generally, the Sign ascending and the Moon are Significators of the <span class="roman">Ship</span>, and what goods are in her. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 157)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Note that here, Lilly stresses that “<span class="ital">the most part of the judgment concerning its </span>safety or ruin<span class="ital"> is derived from the Ascendant and his Lord, and the Moon.”</span> In other words, Lilly’s focus is on the <span class="ital">safety or ruin</span> of a ship rather than on the ship itself, which the Ancients assigned to the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. Interestingly, when Lilly discusses the various parts of the ship, he assigns <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hem to the twelve <span class="ital">signs</span> of the zodiac rather than the twelve astrological houses. </p>
<p class="tx">Some two thousand years ago, Hellenistic astrologers assigned the life and vitality of the native to the Ascendant and 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house of the natal chart. They used the metaphor of a human life as a sea voyage, and they assigned the helm, which steers the ship, to the Ascendant. Thus, Lilly is within the Hellenistic tradition when he assigns the safety and “life” of a ship to the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house and the Ascendant, which steers the ship on its journey.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly’s chapter on the safety of ships follows shortly after his discussion of “whether one absent be dead or alive”:</p>
<p class="Q4">If a Question be demanded of one absent in a general way, and the Querent hath no relation to the party; then the 1st house, the Lord of that house and the Moon shall signify the absent party; the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House or Planet posited in the House or within five degrees of the Cusp of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House shall shew his death or its quality. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 151)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Lilly is clearly drawing an analogy between an absent person and an absent ship when making horary judgments about their safety or destruction.</p>
<p class="tx">In Lilly’s time, the equivalent to a contemporary car would have been the person’s horse, which was used as a means of local transport. Lilly utilizes the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house to represent horses even though they can be considered movable personal property. The Trojan Horse of Homeric fame would probably be assigned to the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house as a type of secret enemy, even though it was the movable property of the Greek army commanded by Odysseus. When the steam locomotive came into use, Victorian society called it an “iron horse,” but no astrologer to my knowledge has assigned steam engines to the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. Modern astrologers frequently assign airplanes to the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, though airplanes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page248" title="248"></span>can be considered the modern equivalent of ancient seagoing vessels used for long-<br/>distance travel.</p>
<p class="tx">Perhaps the key to the matter of house assignment in horary is that there are no absolutes. Assigning an object to a given house depends on the role the object plays in the querent’s life and in the particular question, as well as on the querent’s relationship to th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> object.</p>
