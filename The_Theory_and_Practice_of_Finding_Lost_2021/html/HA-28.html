<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-33">MISSING YOUTHS FROM EAST LYME</p>
<p class="txni">In 1988 four youths from East Lyme, Connecticut, set out on a Saturday night to visit a nightclub in New Haven and mysteriously disappeared without a trace. A nationwide search ensued. The youths were last seen at 11:00 p.m. at an apartment in a college neighborhood in New Haven on 12 November 1988. The chart is cast for the time the youths were last seen (<a href="HA-28.html">Chart 29</a>). </p>
<p class="tx">The ruler of the Leo Ascendant, the Sun, rules the missing youths, as does the co-ruler Moon, which is also a general signifier of runaways and fugitives. With the Sun in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, Lilly’s dictum—namely, that the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house ruler in houses 9, 10, or 11 suggests that the missing person is probably alive (<span class="ital">CA</span> 151)—does <span class="ital">not</span> apply.</p>
<p class="tx">The chart appears radical. It is a Sun hour, and Sol rules the Ascendant. The Moon, which co-rules the missing persons, lies in the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of fun and recreation. The youths <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>ere on their way to a nightclub in New Haven.</p>
<p class="tx">The Sun (missing youths) lies in Scorpio in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. Scorpio is a Water sign, so they may be found low down in a place connected with water. If the question were about a ship at sea, we would be concerned that the ship had sunk beneath the level of the ocean. The Sun (missing youths) in this chart is peregrine (without essential dignity), and is thus lacking in strength or resources to effect a positive outcome. In missing person questions, the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is potentially unfortunate because it signifies final endings and the grave. The co-ruler Moon in the Earth sign Capricorn suggests a dark place at or below ground level.</p>
<p class="tx">Will the missing youths be found dead or alive? The ruler of the Pisces 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is Jupiter. Unfortunately, Ascendant-ruler Sun applies to oppose Jupiter in less than 11.5 degrees. In fact, the Sun and 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>-ruler Jupiter are mutually applying to oppose each other, which makes this opposition even more significant. (Lilly used a moiety of 8.5 degrees for the Sun and 6 degrees for Jupiter: 8.5 + 6 = 14.5 degrees, so the Sun-Jupiter opposition is well within orb in Lilly’s system.)</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"></a>Chart 29: Missing Youths From East Lyme Last Seen (Event Chart) <br/>12 November 1988, 11:00 p.m. EST, New Haven, CT. Saturn day, Sun hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 5<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 24' Aries.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page229" title="229"></span>The condition of the Moon is also troubling. The Moon has recently separated from a conjunction to malefic Saturn and a square to malefic Mars in the Pisces 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death. The Moon next applies to conjoin Neptune, which modern astrologers associate with Pisces on the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp. The Moon applying to conjoin Neptune could indicat<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> the involvement of alcohol or drugs and also raises the possibility of drowning, especially with the Ascendant-ruler Sun in watery Scorpio in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of endings. Pluto, lord of the underworld, in Scorpio on the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp suggests a watery grave.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Arabic Parts in This Chart</p>
<p class="txni">In missing person charts, the question of death often arises. Certain Arabic parts can be useful in judging the matter.</p>
<p class="tx-sa-center"><span class="med">Emerson’s Point of Death: </span>Saturn + Mars − MC</p>
<p class="tx-sa">In her book on horary astrology, Barbara Watters discusses the Lot or Point of Death, which she learned from Charles Emerson: </p>
<p class="Q4">It is arrived at by adding the longitudes of Mars and Saturn and subtracting the longitud<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> of the MC. (Watters 1973, 173)</p>
<p class="tx">She found that this lot works better than the traditional Part of Death. In this chart, Emerson’s Death Point lies at 19 Scorpio 33, where it conjoins the Sun, signifier of the missing youths. Mars, the ruler of the Point of Death, lies in impulsive Aries in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death<span class="CharOverride-4">.</span></p>
<p class="tx-sa-center"><span class="med">Lot of Accidents:</span> Ascendant + Mars − Saturn (by day; reversed at night)</p>
<p class="tx-sa">In this chart, the Lot of Accidents lies at 21<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 52' Scorpio, where it conjoins the Sun, signifier of the missing youths. Mars, the ruler of the Lot of Accidents, lies in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death.</p>
<p class="tx-sa-center"><span class="med">Hermes Lot of Defects, Disease, Infirmities, and Accidents: </span><br/>Ascendant + Saturn − Mars (by day; reversed at night)</p>
<p class="tx-sa">This lot is sometimes called the Lot of Infortune (Misfortune), Accusation, Necessity, or Being Banished or Exiled. In this chart, the Hermes Lot lies at 19<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 03' Taurus, where it opposes the Sun, signifier of the missing youths. Venus, the ruler of the unfortunat<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Hermes Lot, lies in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of local travel.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page230" title="230"></span>On 18 November 1998, the <span class="ital">New York Times</span> reported that the youths had been found at the bottom of a river: “A car carrying four youths from East Lyme, Conn., drove off the closed Chapel Street bridge here into the Mill River because one of three concrete barriers blocking the end of the bridge had been moved, city officials said today” (Ravo 1998). A case of mostly empty beer cans was found in the car, suggesting that alcohol may have played a role in the tragic drowning accident.</p>
