<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-31">LILLY ON WHETHER ONE ABSENT <br/>BE DEAD OR ALIVE</p>
<p class="txni">Querents sometimes consult a horary astrologer about the health or safety of someone who has gone missing. They may ask out of concern for a friend, an acquaintance, a loved one, or even someone they don’t know, as in missing person cases brought by the police. Examples of this type of horary will be presented elsewhere in this volume. The following citation from Lilly’s <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span> presents his approach to dealing with this type of inquiry.</p>
<p class="Q1">If a Question be demanded of one absent in a general way, and the Querent hath no relation to the party; then the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house, the Lord of that house and the Moon shall signify the absent party; the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House or Planet posited in the House or within five degrees of the Cusp of the 8th House shall shew his death or its quality. </p>
<p class="Q2">In judging this Question, see first whether the Lord of the Ascendant, the Moon and the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House or Planet in the 8th house be corporally joined together; or that the Moon, Lord of the Ascendant and the Lord of the 8th are in Opposition either in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> and 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, or 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> and 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, for these are arguments the party is deceased, or sick, and very near death.</p>
<p class="Q2">See also if there be any translation of the light of the Lord of the Ascendant unto the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, especially in degrees deep, lame or deficient; or on the contrary, that there be any translation or carrying the virtue or influence of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> unto the Lord of the Ascendant; or if the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> be posited in the Ascendant, or if the Lord of the Ascendant and the Moon be placed in the 4th house, these are testimonies the party absent be dead.</p>
<p class="Q2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page222" title="222"></span>If the Lord of the Ascendant be separated from a bad Aspect of the Lord of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, you may say the absent hath been lately sick; if from the Lord of the 8th, h<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> hath been in danger of death, but is not dead; if from the Lord of the 12th, he hath been lately much troubled in mind, in fear of imprisonment, arrests, &amp;c., if from the Lord of the 2nd, he hath been hard put to it for money, or in distress for want; if from the Lord of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, in some quarrel or contention; if from the Lord of the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span>, he hath been crossed in his journey (if he was at Sea by contrary winds or Pirates) if at land by Thieves, bad Ways &amp;c., and so of the rest.</p>
<p class="Q2">In judging this question, I have ever found, that if the Lord of the Ascendant be in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, or 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (though many reports went the absent was dead) yet I hav<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> found him to live. Now if you find the absent alive, and you would know, when happily you may hear of him; see in your Ephemerides when the Lord of 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> and the Lord of the Ascendant come to a Trine or Sextile Aspect and about that time, if not that day, news will be had of him; or if the Moon apply to a sextile or trine o<span class="CharOverride-4">f</span> the Lord of the Ascendant see how many degrees she wants of the Aspect, and give days, weeks or months, viz.</p>
<p class="Q2">For every degree in moveable [cardinal] signs, a day; in common [mutable] signs, weeks; and in fixed signs, months. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 151)</p>
