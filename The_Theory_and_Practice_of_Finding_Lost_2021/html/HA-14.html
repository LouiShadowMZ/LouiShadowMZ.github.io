<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-19">THE HOUSES/PLACES (τóποι)</p>
<p class="txni">To interpret a horary chart correctly, the astrologer must be well versed in the meanings of the twelves houses of the horoscope. These twelve divisions of the zodiac originated in Hellenistic astrology, which regarded the rising sign as the first house, or “first place,” and numbered each subsequent whole sign in zodiacal order according to its “place” in the sequence from 1 to 12 (figure 3). Virtually all teachers of horary emphasize the need to understand the significations of the twelve houses, or places, as a prerequisite to analyzing the chart. </p>
<p class="tx">For example, Gadbury gives the following instructions on how to begin the interpretation of a horary chart: “Being well versed therein [in the 12 houses], observe the Nature of your Question propounded, and give the Moon, the Ascendant and his Lord, &amp;c. to th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Querent; then consider unto what House the person or thing enquired after belongs, and give the Moon, the Cusp of that House and his Lord, unto the thing or person enquire<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> after” (Gadbury 1658, 236).</p>
<p class="tx">In the remainder of this chapter, I present some key attributions of the twelve houses, or places, of the horoscope, drawing on the literature from Hellenistic times to the present, including some observations from Hindu astrology. Because horary astrology attempts to assign all possible situations to just twelve houses, this compilation is necessarily incomplete, and the reader will want to amend, modify, and correct these proposed <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>ignifications against the experience gained from working personally with a multitude of horary charts.</p>

<p class="txni">The querent who asks the horary question; the body and appearance of the querent; the personality, temperament, life, health, vitality, survivability, length of life; the viability of a matter; a person inquired about with whom the querent has no personal connection; the <span class="CharOverride-4">m</span>issing person in a “last seen” <span class="ital">event</span> chart; the “safety or ruin” of a ship at sea (<span class="ital">CA</span> 157); the sick person in a decumbiture chart. Hellenistic astrologers referred to this house as the “helm” (steering mechanism).</p>
<p class="hang1-indents"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page117" title="117"></span>LOCATIONS: On or near the querent’s person, with the querent, in a place often frequented by the querent, close by, near an entryway, with light-colored items, with items related to the head or face; in an area described by consignificators Aries and Saturn, or by Mercury, who rejoices in this house.</p>

<p class="txni">That which materially supports and sustains the life and vitality of the querent; movable possessions, personal assets, money, wealth, valuables, riches, gain, wages, substance, acquisitions, financial status, income, savings, profit and loss, money lent to others by the querent, the finances of the querent, resources, treasuries, movable goods, the cost or value of the querent’s assets; the death of a partner (8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>); one’s allies or “friends and assistants” in a lawsuit; one’s “second” in a duel. Anything that the querent owns, other than real estate, belongs in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house.</p>
<p class="hang1-indents">LOCATIONS: With one’s jewelry or valuables, where one stores possessions and movable goods, in a pocketbook or wallet, in a briefcase or backpack, in a safe or a bank, wher<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> the querent typically keeps money or important documents; in a closet, drawer, cabinet, cupboard, or coatroom; near greenish items, with things related to the throat or <span class="CharOverride-4">n</span>eck, in an area described by consignificators Taurus and Jupiter. If the significator of a missing object lies in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, the item is likely to be in a place where you would normally keep it and you may simply have overlooked it. Go back and look again, especially if the significator is retrograde.</p>

Ancient texts include religious sects and foreign travel in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house.

In summ<span class="roman">ary, Bonatti (D</span>ykes, 525) assigns journeys as follows:</p>
<p class="list1">• 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house: short journeys (no more than one day)</p>

Lilly links the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house to “removing from one place to another” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 52), so the missing item may have changed locations and thus may not be where the querent thinks it is or should be.</p>

For a missing ship, the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house could signify the bottom of the ocean.</p>

<p class="hang2-indents">JYOTISH NAISARGIK KARAKAS: The <span class="ital">Moon</span> as a signifier of the mother, the mind, feelings, mothering, comfort, and emotional happiness. Indian astrologers place one’s vehicle or conveyance in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, possibly because our cars function much like our mother’s womb in carrying us about. They also link <span class="ital">Mercury</span> to the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house as a symbol of education, perhaps because the mind (symbolized by the <span class="ital">Moon</span>) requires education for its proper development.</p>
<p class="Ahead">5th Place (Good Fortune) </p>
<p class="txni">Love, courtship, love affairs, fun, pleasures, recreation, things that make you feel good, luxuries, adornments, fancy clothing, games, places of amusement, delights, reproductive sex, babies, offspring, children, pregnancy, breastfeeding, circumcision, things done for fun or entertainment, where one spends enjoyable time with friends or lovers, parties, <span class="CharOverride-4">f</span>easts, fiestas, vacations, pleasure trips, gifts, hobbies, bodily pleasures and indulgences<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> the “finer things in life,” artistic enjoyment, rich foods, delicious meals, banquets, taverns<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> restaurants, bars, nightclubs, theaters, plays, theatrical performances, places of recreation including parks and public gardens, sports, sporting arenas, merriment, speculation, betting, lotteries, recreational alcohol and drug use, gambling, speculative investments; the parents’ wealth and movable goods (2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> from 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>); the assets of a 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house city or town; <span class="CharOverride-4">p</span>rofits from real estate (2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> from 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>); the friends of a spouse or partner (11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>); couriers, pigeons, and ambassadors who are sent by and return to the querent; writing doc<span class="CharOverride-4">u</span>ments to be sent; journeys of one to three days’ duration (Bonatti). Modern astrologers link the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house to creative and artistic endeavors, perhaps because Venus, the goddes<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> of love and adornment, rejoices here. For example. John Frawley regards personal artistic creations, including books that you write, to be metaphorical 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house babies. In contrast, Lilly placed books in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (<span class="ital">CA</span> 55).</p>
<p class="tx">The theme of many 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house significations appears to be “if it feels good, do it.” Note that lovers are signified by the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, lovemaking by the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, and the sex organs (“privy parts”) by the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>.</p>
<p class="hang1-indents">LOCATIONS: Places used for entertainment or recreation, a child’s room, locations where you have fun, a space related to a hobby or enjoyable activity, sports fields, gyms, areas used for romance or sexual pleasure, where one shares a good <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page121" title="121"></span>time with others (e.g., restaurants, bars, theaters, stadiums, concert halls, spas, parks, public gardens, living <span class="CharOverride-4">r</span>ooms, playrooms, etc.); with objects of beauty, comfort, or adornment; with new or fashionable clothing; where the querent’s parents keep their valuables; with honey-colored items; with things related to the heart, stomach, liver, sides, and back; in an area described by consignificators Leo and Venus, who rejoices in this house.</p>

<p class="Ahead">6th Place (Bad Fortune)</p>
<p class="txni">Sickness, infirmities, bodily affliction, illness, remedies, conflict; day laborers, servants, subordinates, inferiors, servitude, “galley slaves” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 53), those who toil at menial labor or thankless tasks for the querent’s benefit; pets, small animals, and the profit or loss from raising “lesser cattle” (up to the size of goats); those whom the querent employs to provide a service; farmers, shepherds, gamekeepers; vassals, tenants; the parent’s siblings (3rd from 4th), the death of a friend (8th from 11th). Some astrologers include modern devices that serve us by slavishly doing our drudge work (e.g., computers, domestic appliances, etc.) in the 6th house. Lilly (<span class="ital">CA</span> 52) views the main significations of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house as bodily ailments; servants and galley slaves; small animals and the profit or loss from herding, “lesser cattle” (sheep, hogs, rabbits, goats, etc.); the father’s siblings (3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> from 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>); and the “inferior part of the belly and intestines even to the arse.” Lilly includes pets in the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house: “the Sign of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> and its Lord signify the Dog, so they must have done if it had been a Sheep, or Sheep, Hogs, Conies, <span class="ital">&amp;c</span>., or any small Cattle” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 393). (Perhaps “tenants” are included in the 6th because they are people herded together like lesser cattle to benefit a master.)</p>
<p class="hang1-indents">LOCATIONS: In a sickroom, in a place related to medicine or where medicines are kept, in a doctor’s office or pharmacy, in the workplace, where menial labor is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page122" title="122"></span>done, a servant’s quarters, where tools or small appliances are kept, a workshop or utility room, where routine tasks or chores are done, with or near an employee or subordinate, with a tenant, on a table or desk, where secretarial work is done, in a folder or file cabinet, in a drawer or container, with a child’s valuables (2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> from 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>), with an aunt or uncle, with a pet, where “lesser cattle” are herded, with dark-colored items, with things related to the lower belly or intestines; in an area described by consignificators Virgo and Mercury, or by Mars, who rejoices in this house. The 6th house is inconjunct (quincunx, or in aversion to) the Ascendant and signifies places that the querent cannot see, as well as changes or travel from place to place; thus, the missing item may be in a location other than where the querent thinks it is or should be, or else it may be concealed behind, within, or beneath something <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hat blocks the view.</p>

<p class="txni">Sunset, nightfall, marriage, marital issues, spouses, lovers, sexual partners, coital interactions, sweethearts, business partners, partnerships, coming-together, negotiations, matters involving two people, pacts, contracts, legally binding agreements, the other party in a contract, the defendant in a lawsuit; colleagues, acquaintances, “one you familiarly deal with or are much conversant with, and is not allied to you” (by blood or other specific relationship); adversary, competitor, public enemy, opponent; duels, lawsuits, contentions, board games (like chess), war, divorce, robbers, fugitives, outlaws, escaped convicts, runaways; paid consultants (including the querent’s personal physician or astrologer), the other party in a financial agreement; the place one would remove to (if you leave your current residence and relocate to a new one); the destination of a journey (“the land for which <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page123" title="123"></span>he set out”—Bonatti, 526); factors that threaten the integrity or viability of whatever is signified by the Ascendant, which lies opposite across the wheel. </p>

<p class="hang2-indents">JYOTISH NAISARGIK KARAKAS: <span class="ital">Venus</span> as signifier of women, wives, finery, partnerships, mutual relations, sexual partners, and conjugal life. Also, <span class="ital">Jupiter</span> as a symbol of the husband in a marriage-like or intimate relationship, as well as signifier of long trips and matters related to foreign countries, including residence abroad or far from home. (Indian astrology regards the planet ruling the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house as a <span class="ital">maraka</span> that can indicate accidents, illness, poverty, misery, or even death for the native when activated in the dasha system. This view is consistent with the “setting sun” symbolism of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house.)</p>
<p class="Ahead">8th Place (Idle Place) </p>
<p class="txni">Death, killing, loss, concealment, elimination, anxiety, fear, dread, stress, panic, anguish of mind, idleness, sluggishness, debt, decline, decay, decomposition, waste, trash, refuse, goods of the dead, undertakers, last will and testament, legacies, dowry, assets or valuables <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page124" title="124"></span>of a partner, money borrowed by the querent from others, resources of the other party in a financial agreement, allies or assets of the querent’s opponents, hiding places, secrets, the occult, the unseen, that which is obscured and needs to be uncovered to be revealed and understood, the privy parts (the genitals and, by analogy, things covered or hidden so they cannot easily be seen), crises, unexpected or unforeseen situations, lethal poisons, serious medical or surgical interventions to deal with life-threatening situations. The 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house i<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> inconjunct (in aversion to) the Ascendant and signifies places that the querent cannot see; thus, the missing item may be in a location other than where the querent thinks it ought <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>o be, or else it may be concealed behind, within, or under something that blocks the view. For example, in a chart about an escaped prisoner (<span class="ital">CA</span> 470), Lilly notes that the prisoner’s significator in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> means that “<span class="ital">he lay obscurely for a while</span>,” that is, he hid himself from view to avoid being caught.</p>
<p class="hang1-indents">LOCATIONS: Places where people or things can “lie obscurely” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 470), locations that are protected or hidden from view, banks, safe deposit boxes, wallets, pocketbooks, pockets in clothing, secret areas, hiding places, closets, covered or concealed locations<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> “idle” places that are visited infrequently; with a partner’s goods, where a partner or someone who lives with the querent keeps money or valuables (2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> of 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>), such as a purse or piggy bank; in the home of the querent’s child (radical 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> is the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> of children), with refuse or junk, in the trash, out in the garbage or recycling; a place where one works with dirt or waste, a laundry room, washroom, bathroom, water closet; with things related to the genitals or the bladder, in the underwear drawer; funeral parlors, morgues, locations related to surgery or healing practices, places associated with the dead or the afterlife; near something dark or heavy (saturnine), with dark green items; in an area described by consignificators Scorpio and Saturn (e.g., a <span class="CharOverride-4">d</span>ark, dirty, moist, or shaded place); in the bathroom, or in places connected with the bladder, genitals, anus, or feces (e.g., under a sofa or car seat). Modern astrologers link the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, Scorpio, and Pluto with death and ideas of transformation and rebirth (or changes to the usual pattern of one’s life), so the missing object could be in a place undergoing demolition and renovation.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="HA-14.html">1</a>. Networking is a modern concept. I used this word here to signify what Al-Rijal (aka Haly Abenragel, a tenth-century Arab astrologer) refers to as seeking friendship to earn assets or to profit from real estate, which seems to me to mean cultivating business contacts or networking. See Dykes’s translation of <span class="ital">Choices and Inceptions</span> (p. 374). Perhaps this ancient signification is also the source of the modern attribution of groups, clubs, and societies or associations to which the querent belongs as matters of the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house.</p>
