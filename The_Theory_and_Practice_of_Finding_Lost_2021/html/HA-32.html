<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-37">LILLY: MONEY LOST—<br/>WHO STOLE IT? IF RECOVERABLE? </p>
<p class="txni">Missing items are not necessarily lost or misplaced. Sometimes they are stolen. This chapter presents Lilly’s approach to horary charts having to do with theft and includes one of Lilly’s example charts from <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span> used to answer the question of whether stolen money would be recovered. </p>
<p class="Ahead">Chapter LXIII: Of Theft (<span class="skew">CA</span> 394–396)</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">It was the received opinion of Master Allen of Oxford, a man excellently versed in Astrology, that the true Significator of a Thief is that Planet who is in an Angle or 2nd house, and beholds the 7th house: if no peregrine Planet be in an angle or the <span class="CharOverride-4">2</span>nd house, then the Lord of the 7th shall be Significator of the Thief, if he behold the 7th house: otherwayes that Planet to whom the Moon applies, if he behold the 7th house; the rather, if the Moon separate from the Lord of the ascendant, And h<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> saith further, that a peregrine Planet on what angle so ever, shall not be Significator of the Thief, unless he behold the 7th house, or have any dignity in the degree of the 7th; yet if one and the same Planet be Lord of the hour and of the ascendant, he shall signify the Thief, though he behold not the ascendant:</p>
<p class="Q3">The truth is, I have ever found that if a peregrine Planet were in the ascendant, he was Significator of the Thief: next to the ascendant, I preferred the angle of the South [10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>], then the West angle [7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>], then the 4th house, last of all the 2nd: many peregrine Planets in angles, many are or may be suspected, justly if they are in Conjunction, Sextile or Trine; not consenting, if in Square or Opposition: ever prefer that peregrine Planet for your Significator, who is nearest to the cusp of the angle he is in. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 394–395)</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page250" title="250"></span>Lilly summarizes the opinion of another astrologer, Master Allen of Oxford, about how to identify the thief in a chart. He then states the results of his own experience abou<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> which planet signifies a thief, in order:</p>
<p class="list1">1. A peregrine planet in the Ascendant (1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house)</p>
<p class="list2">2. A peregrine planet in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (South)</p>
<p class="list2">3. A peregrine planet in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (West)</p>
<p class="list2">4. A peregrine planet in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (North). Elsewhere Lilly writes that he has never found a peregrine planet in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> to represent the thief.</p>
<p class="list3">5. Lastly, a peregrine planet in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house (the querent’s money and possessions)</p>
<p class="tx">Many peregrine planets in angles suggest many thieves. If more than one peregrine planet occupies an angular house, the one closest to the cusp is given preference.</p>
<p class="tx">Note: In a chart for the ques<span class="roman">tion “Goods were stolen, who was the thief?” on page 132 of</span><span class="ital"> London’s Astrological Merline</span>, Lilly writes:</p>
<p class="Q4">This question is resolved, when the goods are known to be stolen, by the peregrine planet in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>, 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house. I could never find any truth in a peregrin<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">p</span>lanet in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>. If none be in the aforesaid houses, take the ruler of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> hous<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> [to be the thief]. (Warren 1989, 81)</p>
<p class="Q1-ital-nsa"><span class="med-ital">Judgment upon This Figure (Chart 34)</span></p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Scorpio here ascends, and partly represents the Querent’s person, Mars his mind and disposition, who being in Square with Mercury and Saturn gave sufficient intimation unto me of the inclination of the Querent, who was sufficiently ill cond<span class="CharOverride-4">i</span>tioned, arrogant, proud, wasteful, &amp;c. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 395) [Though Lilly does not mention it, </span><span class="CharOverride-4">t</span><span class="roman">he Ascendant of this chart lies in the </span><span class="ital">via combusta</span><span class="roman">, which is associated with misfor</span><span class="CharOverride-4">t</span><span class="roman">une and things being obscured.]</span></p>
<p class="tx">Mars, ruler of the Scorpio Ascendant, is the querent’s signifier. Lilly had a bad impression of the personality of this querent, for which he found ample confirmation in the <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>quares from Mars in Leo (the querent) to Mercury and Saturn in Taurus. Elsewhere, Lilly <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>ays that the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house “<span class="ital">hath signification of the life of man, of the stature, colour, complexion, form and shape of him that propounds the Question,” </span>and here he uses the ruler of the Ascendant to represent the querent’s “<span class="ital">mind and disposition</span>” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 50).</p>

If Recoverable? <br/>3 June 1647, 4:54 p.m. LMT, London.<span class="CharOverride-8"> </span>Moon day, Jupiter hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses.

<p class="Q4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page252" title="252"></span>Mars is here in the 25 degr. and 2 min. of Leo, is angular, and but two minutes entered his own Terms, yet being in his Decanate <span class="roman">[Face]</span> I refused him for Significator of the Thief, and that justly, nor indeed was he.<span class="roman"> (</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 395)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Lilly next studies the planets that occupy the angular houses to try to determine the signifier of the thief. Mars occupies the angular 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and is not peregrine (without essential dignity) because Mars lies in its own terms and its own face. Having some essential dignity, Mars cannot be the thief. Lilly’s calculations differ slightly from those done by a modern computer.</p>
<p class="Q4"><span class="roman">In the next place, although Saturn was in the angle of the West, yet did I find him in his own Terms, and Decanate; I also passed by him, In the next place, I found Mercury in 24</span><span class="roman CharOverride-6">o </span><span class="roman">42' Taurus, lately separated or rather in Square of Mars, and now almost in partill Conjunction with Saturn; him I found truly peregrine, viz. having no essential Dignity where he is, therefore I adjudged Mercury to be Significator of the Thief.</span><span class="ital"> </span><span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 396)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Like Mars, Saturn in the angular 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house has dignity by term and face and thus cannot be the thief. Mercury, however, occupies the angular 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and possesses no esse<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span>tial dignity. Being peregrine in an angle, Mercury becomes the significator of the thief. Mercury is a natural signifier of young people, and its gender is determined by other factors in the chart. </p>
<p class="Ahead">On Partile (Partill) Aspects</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly also notes that Mercury is “<span class="ital">almost in partill Conjunction with Saturn.”</span> In his chart calculated in 1647, Mercury is at 24<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 44' Taurus and Saturn at 24<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 22' Taurus, so he is using <span class="ital">partile</span> here to mean perfect or exact. Elsewhere Lilly writes: </p>
<p class="Q4">Partill aspect is when two Planets are exactly so many degrees from each other as make a perfect aspect: as if Mercury be in nine degrees of Aries, and Jupiter in nine degrees of Leo, this is a Partill Trine aspect. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 107)</span></p>
<p class="tx">This statement is often taken to mean that partile aspects are formed when planets occupy the same degree (regardless of minutes) of their respective signs. The idea is that each sign consists of thirty 1-degree parts, and the planets are occupants of these parts tha<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> are in aspect.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page253" title="253"></span>In his book <span class="ital">Merlini Anglici</span> (1677), Lilly changes his definition to this: “<span class="ital">A Partill Aspect comes to pass within the difference of three degrees.</span>” This latter definition most likely stems from the Hellenistic view of aspects as occurring <span class="ital">between signs</span> rather than between planets. However, planets that are each within the corresponding 3-degree <span class="ital">part</span> (hence, “<span class="ital">part-ill</span>”) of zodiac signs that are in aspect (by sign) are especially effective. For example, the sign Aries is trine the sign Leo, so any planet in Aries participates in this trine between signs to any planet in Leo. If the Moon were at 13<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Aries and Mars were at 15<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Leo, this would be an especially effective connection between the Moon and Mars because the two planets would lie within the same 3-degree segment (<span class="ital">part</span>) of their respective signs, which are in trine. By Lilly’s time, planets in the same <span class="ital">parts</span> of signs, which were in aspect, were themselves considered to be in <span class="ital">part</span>-ile aspect.</p>
<p class="Q4">But whether Mercury signified Male or Female, was the dispute, as also the corporature, quality, &amp;c. The angles are part Masculine, part Feminine, no certain judgment could therefore arise from thence, the Moon was in a Masculine Sign, applied to a masculine Planet in a masculine Sign, and Mercury usually is convertible in nature, according to the nature of the Planet he is in aspect with: he is now <span class="CharOverride-4">i</span>n aspect with Mars, and in Conjunction with Saturn; hence I judged the Sex to be Male.<span class="roman"> (</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 396)</span></p>
<p class="tx">To determine the gender of Mercury, Lilly determines which gender predominates in the chart by considering the following factors:</p>
<p class="list1">1. The angles are half in masculine signs and half in feminine signs, so they give no indication one way or the other.</p>
<p class="list2">2. The Moon lies in a masculine sign and applies to the masculine planet Mars in the masculine sign Leo.</p>
<p class="list3">3. The thief’s significator Mercury adopts the sexual nature of the <span class="ital">planets</span> he hangs out with. In this chart, Mercury conjoins the masculine planet Saturn and applies to square the masculine planet Mars.</p>
<p class="tx">Having decided that the thief is a teenage boy, Lilly goes on to describe his physical appearance.</p>
<p class="Q4">And said it was a young Youth of some fifteen or sixteen: young, because Mercury ever signifies Youth; but more young, because the Moon was so near the Sun, and scarce separated from him, I said he was of reasonable stature, thin visaged, hanging <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page254" title="254"></span>Eyebrows, a long Forehead, some blemish or scars in the Face, because Mars cast his Square dexter to Mercury; bad Eye-sight because Mercury is with evil fixed Stars, of the nature of Mars and Moon; a sad Hair, because of his nearness to Saturn; but of a scurvy countenance, one formerly a Thief or suspected for such knaveries: in regard Mercury the Youth his Significator was in Conjunction with Saturn Lord of the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">r</span><span class="CharOverride-15">d</span> &amp; 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, I judged he was some Neighbour’s child; and as the Moon was in Gemini an<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> Mercury in Taurus, I conceived he dwelt either opposite to the Querent or a little Southwest. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 396)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Because Mercury is so closely conjoined to Saturn, Lilly uses the houses that Saturn rules (3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> and 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) to further describe the youth as a neighbor’s child. The Moon always co-signifies the querent. Here, with Mercury (the thieving youth) in Taurus and the Moon (the querent) in the next sign, Gemini, Lilly concludes that the boy resides across the street from the querent or a little southwest.</p>
<p class="Q4">And because Part of Fortune was in the ascendant, and disposed by Mars Lord of the ascendant in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, and the Moon applied to his Sextile aspect, and was within four degrees of the aspect: I judged he should not only hear of, but have hi<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> Money within four days after the Question. He believed not one word I said, but would needs persuade me, that a Woman-servant signified by Mars, was one Thief, and Saturn was another; but I stood firm to the true rules of Art, and would not consent unto it, because both these Planets were essentially dignified. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 396)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Even though Sagittarius is on the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp (the querent’s money) and Jupiter is a signifier of the money, Lilly focuses on the Part of Fortune in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house and its dispositor, Mars, as signifying money and material riches. Lilly follows Ptolemy in defining the Part of Fortune as</p>
<p class="tx-sa-center"><span class="ital">Pars Fortunae </span>= Ascendant + Moon − Sun (in both day and night charts)</p>
<p class="tx-sa">Note that some authors reverse the Sun and Moon of this formula in night charts, but in fact they are then calculating a different Arabic part known as the Part of Spirit or Daimon (Ascendant + Sun − Moon).</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly may have given preference to the Part of Fortune because it is angular and its dispositor, Mars, also occupies an angular house. In contrast, Jupiter is peregrine (in a location where it has no essential dignity) and occupies the rather weak cadent 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page255" title="255"></span>According to Lilly, the <span class="ital">relative strength of the houses</span> is in the following order, from strongest to weakest:</p>
<p class="tx-sa-center">(strongest house) 1 – 10 – 7 – 4 – 11 – 5 – 9 – 3 – 2 – 9 – 6 – 12 (weakest house)</p>
<p class="tx-sa">The Moon at 20<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 25' Gemini (in the modern chart) applies by sextile to Mars at 25<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 07' Leo. Since this sextile will perfect in 4 degrees 41 minutes, Lilly judges that the money will be returned in about four days. Here Lilly is using a symbolic measure of time, equating each degree of separation between the significators with one day in the life of the querent.</p>
<p class="Q4">The event proved directly true as I had manifested, both as to the person described, and to the day of the money returned, which was within three days after. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 396)</span></p>
<p class="tx">In fact, the money returned three days after the time of the horary chart, when the transiting Moon conjoined both the horary and transiting Jupiter, which occurred at 7:27 p.m. and 8:20 p.m., respectively. Transits to the horary chart can be used for timing the unfolding of what is promised in the chart.</p>
