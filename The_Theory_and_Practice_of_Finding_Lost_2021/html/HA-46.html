<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-51">GRIFFIN: AN ASTROLOGICAL <br/>JUDGEMENT TOUCHING THEFT (1665)</p>
<p class="txni">The booklet <span class="ital">An Astrological Judgement Touching Theft </span>by Anthony Griffin appeared in 1665. Griffin was a contemporary of William Lilly, and his text gives a glimpse into how another horary astrologer of Lilly’s period reasoned through horary questions about theft. Much of what Griffin says resembles what can be found in Lilly’s <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span>, and some <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>f it may sound rather silly and antiquated to the modern ear. Unfortunately, the exampl<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> chart that Griffin uses is quite confusing, because it is not clear whether he calculated th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> planetary positions incorrectly or whether he simply did not know what day of the week the querent asked him the question. Thus, he draws conclusions based on questionable data, which does not make a convincing argument for his method. The reader will need to test Griffin’s guidelines about how to judge a horary chart regarding thefts to see whether <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hey hold water in everyday practice.</p>
<p class="Q1">To his much-Honoured friend Mr. Charles Chip, the author wishes all happiness in this world, and eternal felicity in the world to come. Sir, I made bold to dedicate this small piece to you, though somewhat a stranger to you at present, yet being desired by a faithful friend of yours, who informed me of the great respect you owe to Art, I could do no less. Therefore good sir, let me crave your pardon in this my presumption, and let me desire you to pass by my imbecilities, which I do not fear but that you will, when you have seriously considered my minority and how hard a matter it is to comprehend the profundity of this sublime science. And now to let you understand what moved me here to make myself public is the true love that I owe to my country, and I hope most will receive benefit by those my weak endeav<span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>urs, and upon this account only, I have presumed to make known to the world this little tract of astrology touching theft, knowing it must pass the censure of variou<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page344" title="344"></span>capacities, and from the unskilled I expect blots, but from the judicious a friendly <span class="CharOverride-4">c</span>orrection, and if at last it may be crowned with your protection, my expectation is fully answered. Who faithfully desires to subscribe himself, sir, your devoted servant forever to command, Anthony Griffin.</p>
<p class="Ahead">To the Reader</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">Reader, when I did seriously consider what mischief is done by thieves and cheaters, I could do no less but make public this little treatise touching theft, etc. wherein astrologically is plainly laid down some very excellent rules of Art experimentally <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>mplified, easy to be understood by the meanest capacity, and certainly will be of much advantage, not only to those who are well-versed in this most sublime science; but to most others that are desirous to be instructed therein. And for the better understanding I have here showed you whether the figure at the time of the question is radical or not that you may not deceive yourselves nor the querent, but certainly direct him how to find the thief or goods stolen, etc. and not out of the querent’s house, but he judges it stolen because theft is so much practiced by servants, etc. Therefore I have demonstrated to your view whether it be stolen or remain in the house (if so) in what part thereof it may probably be found. But if the goods are stolen, I have showed you the best rules how to describe the thief or <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hieves, which way they live, strangers or familiars, etc. Likewise concerning beasts, if they are stolen or strayed, and fugitives with many other matters very useful and beneficial to all that are students in this Art, viz. judicial astrology. So courteous reader, let me desire you to pardon my imbecilities, and if God permit me with life and health, I shall furnish you with another piece treating of the judgment of all horary questions, more particular than any yet extant; and to all carping critics and fantastical censurers I thus make them an answer, <span class="ital">Ut Ignam Caves Omnibus ignotis, Allatrant its barbari; Quicduid non intelligent Carpunt at damnant</span>. </p>

<p class="Ahead">First to Know Whether the Figure Be Radical or Not </p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">• If the lord of the ascendant and the lord of the hour be both of one triplicity, the figure is radical and judgment may safely be given. </p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page345" title="345"></span><span class="ital">~ Example</span>: If Aries ascends and Mars be lord of the hour, the figure is radical; the same if Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces ascends, Mars governing that triplicity. If Sagittarius or Pisces ascends and Jupiter be lord of the hour, the figure is radical, and <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hus observe of all the rest, which by your own discretion you may easily fin<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> out. </p>
<ul>
<li class="BI2-right-indent">When the latter degrees of a sign ascend, it is not safe to give judgment unless the age, corporature, and complexion of the querent do agree with the degree<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> ascending. </li>
<li class="BI2-right-indent">Also when the second, third, fourth or fifth degrees of a sign ascends, chiefly in signs of short ascension, it is not safe to give judgment unless the querent be young and short in stature. </li>
<li class="BI2-right-indent">Likewise if the Moon be in the first degrees of a sign or else in the latter, give no judgment, for the querent comes to try you and likewise for deceit. </li>
<li class="BI2-right-indent">Likewise if the Moon be unfortunate or be void of course, or if Scorpio does ascend, or if the Dragon’s Tail be in the first or 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, or if the fortunes and the infortunes be of equal strength, all these do signify errors in judgment, and an unlucky end of the question. </li>
<li class="BI2-right-indent">Narrowly observe whether the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house or his lord be afflicted, for then it is an argument that the artist shall not gain credit by the question, for the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house signifies the artist himself.<p class="Ahead _idGenParaOverride-3">Now I Shall Begin Concerning Theft or Any Other Thing Lost </p><p class="Q1-nsa _idGenParaOverride-1">When a question is propounded concerning theft, it is very convenient to examine the figure and see whether the thing enquired after be stolen or not or whether it be in the querent’s house or not, which may be discerned several ways as thus. </p><p class="BI1-right-indent _idGenParaOverride-1">• If neither the lord of the house of the Moon, or the lord of the house of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> separate not themselves one from another, nor any planet from, then the thing enquired after is in its own place. </p></li>
<li class="BI2-right-indent">If the disposer of the Moon and the lord of the ascendant be in conjunction, then is the thing missing in the house of the querent. </li>
<li class="BI2-right-indent">If the lord of the ascendant did separate from Jupiter, or from the lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, then did the querent lay it down or forget it. </li>

Thirdly the part of fortune in an easterly sign yet in a northern quarter. Fourthly Mars lord of the 4th and disposer of the part of fortune in a northern sign, but in the western quarter. Fifthly the Moon being in quartile with the Sun, he being in a westerly sign.</p><p class="Q2 _idGenParaOverride-1">Because that the Moon was in a south sign, but in the east quarter next applying to Venus, she entering an east sign, and in an easterly quarter, but this I shall describe more at large hereafter. Therefore according to the aforesaid testimonies, I sent the querent to Cow-Cross, or about the lower end of Long-lane London<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> which it did so appear after discovery that they were devoided in an alley near Cow-cross, and by this means did I discover it.</p><p class="Q2 _idGenParaOverride-1">First, I find the Moon in the first house, and the [Moon] applying to Venus, she [Venus] having exaltation in the 3rd [Pisces], and entering the sign ascending [Sagittarius], she [Venus] being lady of the [Libra] tenth house, which is the house of discovery. Also Venus being a feminine planet and the sign of the 3rd a feminine sign, where Venus hath exaltation, and the part of fortune being in the third, I told the querent that the goods would be discovered, and that by a sister of hers, or som<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> kinswoman that dwelt that way, and so it was for it was discovered by her own sister after this manner. Sixthly, the Dragon’s tail being in a westerly sign, but in the north quarter, the which doth signify the devoiding, and the sale of the goods to b<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">n</span>orth-west from the querent, notwithstanding the greatest part of the goods went to the south-east, but yet where after that they were devoided.</p><p class="Q2 _idGenParaOverride-1">One of the thieves sent a woman to sell the clothes at the querent’s sister’s house, and her sister knew the goods by which means they were all taken. The querent had some part of satisfaction, but not all, as the Dragon’s tail in the 2nd doth show.</p><p class="Q2 _idGenParaOverride-1">But there was grand testimony of discovery, because the Moon was in the first house. Secondly, Saturn lord of the 2nd in the Ascendant with Jupiter lord thereof.

Secondly, the Moon in Capricorn a feminine sign peregrine, and applying to Venus a feminine planet, I did discover another woman. Also finding the Sun in opposition to the part of fortune, I did discove<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> another which was a man and this was true, for the man made his escape, the two women were taken and committed to New-gate and both of them were condemned to die yet one was reprieved and the other was hanged.</p><p class="Ahead _idGenParaOverride-3">Concerning Beasts or Any Living Thing Lost or Strayed</p><p class="Q1-nsa _idGenParaOverride-1">First of all, if the lord of the 2nd, or lord of the sixth, or lord of the house of the Moon do separate from any planet, then strayed; but if any planet separate from them, then led away. If the Moon give virtue to Saturn or Mars, or to the lord of <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he 8th, or to any planet in a cadent house, especially by trine or sextile, the beasts are strayed of themselves. Note that the separation herein named, is that when one planet separates from another by conjunction and no otherwise. If the lord of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> house of the Moon, or lord of the 2nd, do separate from any planet, or from their own houses, or the signs be fixed, then stolen; but if moveable, fled of themselves.</p><p class="Ahead _idGenParaOverride-3">That the Cattle Are Driven Away or Stolen</p><p class="Q1-nsa _idGenParaOverride-1">If any planet separates from the lord of the house of the Moon, they are driven away or stolen.

If the lord of the 6th be in moveable signs, they are hilly grounds. If the lord of the 6th be in fixed signs, in marshy grounds where new buildings are. If in common signs, then in grounds where ditches and water are, and where rushes grow. If the lord of the term of the Moon be in fixed signs, they be in places newly taken in, or near some new buildings. If in moveable signs, in a place full of hills.

If <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page368" title="368"></span>the lord of the 6th does so behold the lord of the term of the Moon, the same.

If the lord of the term of the Moon, or the lord of the 4th house, be with the lord of the ascendant, the owner shall have his goods again. The Moon in trine or sextile to the lord of the ascendant, they will be found. The Moon in trine or sextile <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>o the Sun, then they may be found. The Sun in the ascendant, except in Libra or Aquarius, the goods will be found. The lord of the ascendant, or the lord of the 2nd house, in the house of the significator fortunate, they shall be found.</p><p class="Q2 _idGenParaOverride-1">As you have the explanation of small beasts by the 6th house and his lord, after the same manner judge by the twelfth house and his lord for great beasts.</p><p class="Ahead _idGenParaOverride-3">Concerning Fugitives</p><p class="Bhead-nsa-indents _idGenParaOverride-5">How to Find Out the Significator of a Fugitive</p><p class="Q1-nsa _idGenParaOverride-1">If a question be proposed concerning one that dwelt in the house with the querent, then take the planet in the ascendant not being the lord thereof. But if non<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> be there, then take the planet that is in the sign or house where the lord of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> ascendant is; if none be there, then take the Moon, she shall be the significator of the fugitive. But if he enquires for his servant, then take the 6th house and his lord; if for his brother or sister, then the 3rd house; if for his child, then the fifth house. If for his acquaintance, his public enemy, or his wife or sweet heart, then take the 7th house, if for his friend, then take the eleventh house, and so be sure to take th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> right significator.</p><p class="Bhead-indents _idGenParaOverride-5">Whether the Fugitive Will Be Found or Come Again</p><p class="Q1-nsa _idGenParaOverride-1">If the significator of the fugitive be in the ascendant, he comes of his own accord. <span class="CharOverride-4">I</span>f the Moon be separated from the lord of the ascendant, and then immediately applies to the significator of the fugitive, you shall hear news of the party fled, for some or other will tell you where he is. If the significator of the fugitive be combust, or entering into combustion, the fugitive shall be found though he hide hi<span class="CharOverride-4">m</span>self<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page369" title="369"></span> secretly, this has been often proved. If the Moon separates from the significator of the fugitive, and then immediately applies to the lord of the ascendant, then the fugitive is sorry that he went away, and will send one to treat that he may com<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> again. If the Moon be joined to ill planets, as Saturn or Mars, or the Dragon’s Tail, or to a planet retrograde, he shall be found, or come again of his own accord. If the lord of the ascendant beholds an evil planet from the house signifying the fugitive, the querent shall then find the party fled. If the Moon separates from Jupiter or Venus, he shall come back again, or a thing lost shall be quickly found. If the Moon beholds her own house by sextile or trine, the fugitive shall return in three days.</p><p class="Q2 _idGenParaOverride-1">The Moon being in Virgo, he that flies shall soon return. If the lord of the ascendant be joined to the significator of the fugitive or applying to them, or applying to it, the fugitive is taken. The lord of the ascendant in his own house, he shall be taken. The significator of the fugitive unfortunate by Saturn or Mars, then taken. The Moon in the ascendant with Jupiter or Venus, he comes again. The lord of the ascendant and the Moon applying to the lord of the tenth, or to the lord of the house of the Moon, the fugitive shall be found. The Moon unfortunate, he shall b<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> taken, but chiefly when she is unfortunate in the tenth house. The Moon and lord of the ascendant in the ascendant and the Sun beholding them by a trine or sextile, the fugitive shall be found the same day; but with a quartile aspect, in a week; with an opposition, in a month. When the significator of the fugitive comes into the house of the lord of the ascendant, then comes the fugitive into the hands of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> querent. If the Moon be in evil terms, and with Saturn or Mars, or either of them be in the house where the Moon is, he is with some poor strange people who will <span class="CharOverride-4">b</span>ring him again.</p><p class="Bhead-indents _idGenParaOverride-5">Where the Fugitive Is</p><p class="Q1-nsa _idGenParaOverride-1">If the Moon give virtue to Saturn or Mars, or be in any of their houses, then he is with some kinsman as evil as himself. If the significator of the fugitive be in the 7th house, he is hid in the house of him that knows him well.</p>
<p class="Q2 _idGenParaOverride-1">If his significator be in an angle, he is in a house; if in ascendant, he is in a close or street; if in a cadent house, he is in a common, an indifferent large distance off. If the <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>ignificator of the fugitive or the Moon be in a strong angle within three degrees of the ascendant or his Lord, it notes the fugitive to be in the town or parish of the querent and very near him. If he be within seventy degrees of the ascendant or his lord, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page370" title="370"></span>he is yet in town, but chiefly if he be in an angle, but if he be above seventy degrees and in a cadent house, then he is gone far. If the significator of the fugitive be in the fourth, sixth, or tenth houses, he is gone but a little way, but if he be in the 3rd or ninth houses, then he is gone far. If any planet has dignities where the significator of the fugitive is, if planet separates from the lord of the ascendant, and applies to any planet in the sixth, 8th, or twelfth house, he is then out of town. If the significator of the fugitive be going out of one sign into another, then he is new gone out of town. If the significator of the fugitive beholds the lord of the ascendant with a quartile aspect, he is gone out of town. If the significator of the fugitive be departing from th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Sun, he is gone out of town. The significator of the fugitive separating from the lord of the ascendant, especially if he have any dignities in the place where the significator <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>f the fugitive is, and he applying to any planet in the sixth, 8th, or twelfth houses, he is gone out of town.</p><p class="Bhead-indents _idGenParaOverride-5">To Know the Distance between the Querent and the Fugitive</p><p class="Q1-nsa _idGenParaOverride-1">If the significators of the fugitive and the lord of the ascendant be in fixed signs account for every degree, between him and the lord of the ascendant, three miles. If in common [mutable] signs, one mile. If the significator of the fugitive be in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> houses, he then is gone but a little way, but in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> or 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> houses, h<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> then is gone far.</p><p class="Q2 _idGenParaOverride-1">Mind the distance of the aspect that the Moon has from the sign or cusp of the significator of the fugitive or from the fugitive himself. And for one degree in a common sign give five paces, and for one degree in a moveable [cardinal] sign give seventeen paces. And for one degree in a fixed sign give a thousand paces. Note that one-mile gives one thousand fifty six paces. Consider likewise whether the fugitive be in town or not, then give distance accordingly, and so observing thy distances aright, you cannot err. For which way the fugitive is gone, you must note that the Moon has a grand significator for fugitives, therefore look to the significator of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> fugitive and to the Moon, and according to the strongest of them judge, and in th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> sign and quarter that the strongest is in, say that way the fugitive is gone. </p></li>
