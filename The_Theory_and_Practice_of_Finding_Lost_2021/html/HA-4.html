<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-9">RAPHAEL’S GUIDELINES FOR FINDING <br/>ANYTHING HIDDEN OR MISLAID (1887)</p>
<p class="txni">The following excerpt comes from <span class="ital">Raphael’s Horary Astrology</span>, by which every question relating to the future may be answered (1887). Raphael, who appears to have based his guidelines on the works of William Lilly (1647) and W. J. Simmonite (1851), said the following about missing objects:</p>
<p class="Q1">To find anything hidden or mislaid—If it belongs to the querent, take the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house; if to his brother, the fourth; his child, the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>; his wife, the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, etc.</p>
<p class="Q2">If the lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> (as described above) be in an angle, it is in the house of the owner, and if the lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in the ascendant, it is in that part of the hous<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> wherein he mostly abides, but if this lord be in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, it is in the hall or dining room; but if the querent be a mechanic or tradesman, it is in his shop; if the lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, it is where his wife mostly works.</p>
<p class="Q2">If a fortune [benefic] be rising, or the lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in the ascendant, it will be found again, the same if the lord of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> be in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, or the Moon in trine to the lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, or the lord of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in good aspect to the lord or the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> or 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, and well dignified.</p>
<p class="Q2">A favorable sign are the lights above the earth [above the horizon], the missing articles are almost sure to be then found; but if you find them [the Sun and the Moon] under the earth, and the lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> afflicted, the articles will not be found or recovered.</p>
<p class="Q2">The quality of the place where the article is, may be known by the sign the significators are in, and the sign on the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>. If these be airy it is hidden in the topmost part of the house, or the eaves, or the top of the room in which it is. If <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page36" title="36"></span>watery it is near a wash-house, sink, pool, river; in fiery signs, near the chimney or fire, near iron; if in earthy signs it is near or in the ground or floor.</p>
<p class="Q2">If the significator be going out of one sign into another, it is behind something, or fallen down between two rooms, or near a door or threshold joining two rooms. [Note by Anthony Louis: This same guideline may also hold true if the significator is going out of one house into the next. In addition, I have previously quoted Alphee Lavoie’s observation of a strong correlation between extremely late or early degrees in a sign and the missing article being near a door, window, or gate, or in a box or package and about to be moved to a new location. According to Lavoie, the same principle applies when the ruler of the second house is within two degrees of any house cusp (Lavoie 1995).]</p>
<p class="Q2">Note:—If the lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in a succedent house it is out of the house and in the garden, yard, or out-buildings, not far distant from the house, but if this lor<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> be cadent it is far away, or lost or hid at some distance.</p>
<p class="Q2">Judge of the locality, direction, etc., it is in, by the nature and quality of the signs occupying the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, and containing the significator, …</p>
<p class="Q2">The nature of the article mislaid can be judged by the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, or planet therein. Saturn shows lead, iron, tin instruments, umbrellas, carts, etc.; Jupiter, oil, paint, men’s clothes, poultry, silk, honey, money, or any kind of merchandise; Mars shows arms, brass, knives, cutlery, swords, and all sharp or cutting instruments; the Sun, gold, jewels and valuable articles; Venus, women’s clothes, rings, brooches, and ornaments; Mercury, paper, paper money, deeds, books, letters, scientific instruments, etc.; the Moon, all common things, as crockery, china, saucepans, kettles, brushes, and such things as are in everyday use; Uranus, models, machinery, galvanic apparatus, and all uncommon novelties. (Raphael 1887, 68–69)</p>
<p class="Ahead">The French Woman’s Keys</p>
<p class="txni">Let’s look at a question to illustrate the use of the horary method. In 1994 I received a phone call from my friend Patrick, a Frenchman who lives in the United States. His mother had just telephoned him from France to say that she had lost her keys. She had searched everywhere in her Paris apartment to no avail, and it finally occurred to her to call her son in Connecticut. She wanted him to ask his astrologer friend (me) to do a chart to locate the missing keys. Since I don’t speak French, he was relaying his mother’s question to me. I understood his mother’s question at 12:51 p.m. EDT on Sunday, 18 September 1994, at my coordinates, 41N17, 73W02 (<a href="HA-4.html">Chart 5</a>). It was a Sun day during a Mars hour. I decided to follow Lilly’s method and cast the chart with Regiomontanus houses.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>Chart 5: The French Woman’s Keys<br/>12:51 p.m. EDT, 18 September 1994, 41N17, 73W02. Sun day, Mars hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 10° 36' Pisces.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page38" title="38"></span>The Sagittarius Ascendant signifies the querent, making Jupiter her ruler. The Moon is the co-ruler of the querent in every question. The Sagittarius Ascendant makes symbolic sense because the querent is a foreigner who lives abroad.</p>
<p class="tx">Her possessions are shown by the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, with Capricorn on the cusp, so Saturn rules the keys. The fact that Saturn is retrograde is good news, because the significator of a lost object being retrograde (moving backward) often means that it will return to the querent (<span class="ital">CA</span> 160, 329, 406, 468). </p>
<p class="tx">The Moon (co-ruler of the querent) is separating from a conjunction to Saturn (the keys) in the sign Pisces, which is associated with absentmindedness. Jupiter (the querent) is last separating from a trine to Saturn (the keys), again suggesting forgetfulness. Lilly comments:</p>
<p class="Q4">Behold from whom the Lord of the ascendant did last separate, and if he did separate from Saturn, the cause of the lost thing was through forgetfulness of the owner, who knows not where he laid it, or it is forgotten by reason of some cold or sickness which afflicted the loser, especially if Saturn be Retrograde. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 321)</p>
<p class="tx">The chart strongly suggests that she forgot her keys somewhere, but where? The 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> ruler Saturn (the keys) occupies the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of siblings, kin, neighbors, and short trips. Perhaps she went to visit a relative or neighbor and left her keys at their house. Saturn (the keys) is in the same astrological house and sign as the Moon, a general signifier of women. Maybe she left them with a woman. Mars is exalted in Capricorn and thus rules the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp by exaltation. Mars (co-ruler of the keys by exaltation) in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house raises the possibility that she left her keys in the home of one of her children, since the radical 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> is the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> of children.</p>
<p class="tx">It is encouraging that the Moon is separating from a conjunction with Saturn (the keys) and applying almost immediately to trine Jupiter (Ascendant ruler, the querent). Thus, the Moon may translate the light from Saturn to Jupiter and reactivate the recent past trin<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> between them.</p>
<p class="tx">Another indicator of the missing keys is the planet that rules the Part of Fortune, a symbol of the querent’s prosperity and material goods. The Part of Fortune in Taurus has Venus as its dispositor. Venus (a co-ruler of the keys) applies to conjoin Ascendant-ruler Jupiter (the querent) in about four degrees. The Moon is exalted in Taurus, so the Moon rules the Part of Fortune by exaltation. As such, the Moon can also symbolize the keys. The fact that the Moon quickly applies to trine Jupiter (the querent) suggests that the querent will soon recover her keys.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page39" title="39"></span>I told Patrick the analysis of the chart, and he telephoned his mother in Paris with the news. The only woman she had visited recently was her daughter (Patrick’s sister), who lived not far from her in Paris. Patrick’s mother called his sister, who found the keys in a box where her family usually keeps their keys.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Have I Found the Girl of My Dreams?</p>
<p class="txni">One of my clients is a man in his thirties whom I have known for the past fifteen years. He first consulted me around age twenty because he was having trouble in relationships. His issue was that he felt highly sexed, with little ability to control his impulse to jump into bed with any willing woman he found attractive, even if she was married or in another relationship. These adventures always ended badly. At the time of our first consultation, he was having an affair with the wife of a male relative with whom he worked daily in a family business.</p>
<p class="tx">In his natal chart, Scorpio rises (<a href="HA-4.html">Chart 6</a>). Mars rules his Ascendant, and Venus rules his 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp of partnerships. Pisces on the cusp of the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of love affairs makes Jupiter the ruler of his amorous adventures. Modern astrologers regard Neptune as a ruler of Pisces. </p>
<p class="tx">Scorpio rising is often regarded as a sexually oriented sign. Sigmund Freud, who considered the libido to be the foundation of human psychology, has a Scorpio Ascendant. Venus rules the natal 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp in this chart, which has to do with this client’s prospects for serious committed relationships. Venus in Gemini (a dual sign) is involved in an opposition with retrograde Neptune (fantasy) in freedom-loving Sagittarius. Venus is also involved i<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> a square with Saturn in Virgo. </p>
<p class="tx">Gemini is a sign that loves diversity, and 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> ruler Venus in Gemini symbolizes this man’s fondness for variety in intimate relationships. The opposition to Venus from Neptune retrograde in Sagittarius (a sign that likes to roam freely and disdains restriction) fits the pa<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>tern of his behavior. The square from Saturn (the “greater malefic”) to Venus reflects the difficulties he was having establishing and maintaining committed relationships.</p>
<p class="tx">Over the years since the first consultation, this client has contacted me periodically, always with a question about a new love relationship. Finally, in 2013 he met someone new who swept him off his feet. He had never felt toward anyone the way she made him feel, and he thought he might have finally met “the one.” In an email he asked, “Have I found the girl of my dreams?” I read and understood the question on 18 April 2013 at 7:11 a.m. EDT at coordinates 41N17, 73W02 (<a href="HA-4.html">Chart 7</a>). </p>

<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page42" title="42"></span>What struck me about this chart is that the horary house cusps are almost a mirror image of the man’s natal chart. In the horary chart, Taurus rises and Venus rules the Ascendant, making her the significator of the querent. The Moon co-rules the querent.</p>
<p class="tx">The 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of the Ascendant lies at 3° 24' Capricorn in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of loss and death, with Capricorn on the cusp of the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of dreams. (Hellenistic astrologers <span class="CharOverride-4">d</span>ivided each zodiacal sign into twelve parts of 2.5 degrees each, and assigned each part to one of the twelve signs of the zodiac. We will discuss 12<span class="superscript-roman _idGenCharOverride-1">th</span> parts in detail in <a href="HA-25.html">Chapter 25</a> and <a href="HA-47.html">Appendix V</a>.) Saturn, the ruler of Capricorn, lies in the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of infirmities, where it opposes Venus, a general significator of female lovers.</p>
<p class="tx">Mars, ruler of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house Scorpio cusp, signifies the potential “girl of his dreams”—the “quesited” about whom he is inquiring.</p>
<p class="tx">Venus (the querent) is separating from Mars (the woman inquired about). Mars is quite powerful, being in his home sign Aries and also <span class="ital">cazimi</span>, or in the heart of the Sun. Being cazimi is considered an especially positive condition. Venus has just changed signs from Aries to Taurus, which she rules; but Venus is under the Sun’s beams. All of this is occurring in the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of the querent’s undoing.</p>
<p class="tx">The Moon, which co-rules the querent in horary questions, also rules the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of final endings and conjoins the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp. The Moon is quite strong in Cancer, which it rules; but Luna applies to square Mars in Scorpio (the quesited woman of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) in less than a degree, suggesting a powerful clash of wills. </p>
<p class="tx">In addition, the querent’s primary ruler Venus mutually applies to oppose Saturn retrograde in Scorpio in the unfortunate 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. Saturn in the horary chart rules the Aquarius 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp of the querent’s hopes and wishes (to find the woman of his dreams). Saturn in Scorpio is also disposed by Mars (the quesited woman), so his frustrating influence acts through her (Mars).</p>
<p class="tx">All in all, this chart suggests that he has <span class="ital">not</span> found the woman of his dreams. The emphasis on the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house suggests the possibility of deception or underhanded activity in the relationship, which could leave him feeling bereft and grief-stricken, as had so often happened with other relationships. </p>
<p class="tx">I didn’t hear from this client again until 2015, when he told me that the 2013 relationship had fallen apart, as the chart had indicated. However, he had recently met someone new and thought that this time she might really be “the one.” He is getting older and would like to settle down and start a family. I hope he is right about this new relationship.</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page43" title="43"></span>A Note on Cazimi and Combustion</p>
<p class="txni">According to Lilly, </p>
<p class="Q4">a Planet is in the heart of the Sun, or in Cazimi, when he is not removed from him 17 minutes [of arc] or is within 17 minutes [of arc] forward or backward, as Sun in <span class="CharOverride-4">1</span>5°<span class="CharOverride-6"> </span>30' Taurus, Mercury in 15°<span class="CharOverride-6"> </span>25' of Taurus: here Mercury is in Cazimi, and all Authors do hold a Planet in Cazimi to be fortified there. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 113)</p>
<p class="tx">In Lilly’s definition, a planet is in cazimi when it lies within 17 arc minutes of the Sun, “forward or backward” along the ecliptic. In this horary chart (chart 7), the Sun at 28<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 34' Aries is only 6 arc minutes away from 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> ruler Mars at 28<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 28' Aries along the ecliptic. Lilly considered being cazimi to be quite beneficial, so why did this relationship end badly? The answer may lie in the fact that the ancients were observational astrologers who looked at the actual positions of planets in both latitude and longitude in the celestial dome. </p>
<p class="tx">Since the Sun travels on the ecliptic, it has zero latitude. By definition, the center of the Sun always lies exactly on the ecliptic (the path of the Sun). The radius of the disc of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">S</span>un, as viewed by us on Earth, extends about 17 arc minutes above and below the ecliptic. The disc of Mars can be at most 25 arc seconds wide, and its radius at most 0<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 0' 12.5" of arc (or 0.2 minutes of arc). However, Mars can travel in the sky above or below the level o<span class="CharOverride-4">f</span> the ecliptic; that is, Mars can have non-zero latitude.</p>
<p class="tx">In chart 7, Mars has latitude −23 arc minutes (that is, the center of Mars lies 23 arc minutes below the center of the Sun), so there is a gap of about 5.8 minutes of arc betwee<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> the disc of Mars and the disc of the Sun. Thus, in the sky, the body of Mars is separated from the body of the Sun by at least 5.8 arc minutes, and a true cazimi condition does not exist between them. In reality, Mars is combust the Sun, which is a negative factor, as evidenced by the fact that the querent got “burned” by this relationship.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly defines combustion like this: </p>
<p class="Q4">A Planet is said to be Combust of the Sun, when in the same Sign where the Sun is in, he is not distant from the Sun eight degrees and thirty minutes, either before or after the Sun. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 113)</p>
<p class="tx">He goes on to explain that </p>
<p class="Q4">the significator of the Querent Combust, shews him or her in great fear, and over powered by some great person. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 113) </p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page44" title="44"></span>In this case, the querent was smitten (overpowered) by the woman signified by Mars, ruler of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house.</p>
<p class="tx">In the querent’s natal chart (chart 6), the Sun at 19<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 38' Cancer has zero latitude and Mercury at 19<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 32' Cancer has a latitude of 4 degrees 49 minutes of arc south of the ecliptic. Even though the Sun and Mercury are only 6 arc minutes apart when viewed along <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he ecliptic, they are 4 degrees 49 minutes apart when viewed along the vertical axis of latitude. Since Mercury is traveling almost five degrees below the level of the Sun, their bodies do not overlap and Mercury is not truly cazimi, or in the heart of the Sun. Instead, due to the wide separation in latitude between Mercury and the Sun, the planet Mercury is really combust in this case. This is borne out by the fact that Mercury rules his 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of hopes and wishes, and the querent has had such a difficult time establishing his hoped-for long-term relationship with a woman.</p>
<p class="Ahead">The Combust Signifier of a Missing Object or Person</p>
<p class="txni">When the planet signifying a missing object is combust the Sun, it literally <span class="ital">cannot be seen</span> in the sky because it is obscured by the rays of the Sun. Symbolically, combustion means that <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he object is somehow obscured or <span class="ital">hidden from view</span>. It may be behind, within, or beneath something. For example, it could have fallen behind a piece of furniture, or between the cushions of a couch, or beneath a car seat, etc., or it may be inside a bag, box, drawer, pocket, pocketbook, carrying case, or backpack. </p>
<p class="tx">In a missing person chart, the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house ruler being combust the Sun may literally mean that the person inquired about was “<span class="ital">in great fear, and over powered by some great person</span>” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 113) at the time of the disappearance. A dramatic example of this configuration occurred in the case of a young college student who was home for the holidays when he disappeared after entering Borrego Park (33N41, 117W40) in the Lake Forest area of Orange County, California, on 2 January 2018 at around 11:00 p.m. PST (<a href="HA-4.html">Chart 8</a>). The “last seen chart” for this event has Libra rising, with Venus conjunct the Sun and therefore combust. The student’s body was found on January 9 in a shallow grave near the park; he had been stabbed more than twenty times. A detailed account of this event can be found on my blog under the title “Student Missing in Lake Forest” (Louis 2018).</p>

<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page46" title="46"></span>Palchus’s Fifth-Century Horary Chart: <br/>The Safety of a Ship at Sea</p>
<p class="txni">One of the earliest examples of a horary chart dates back to the fifth century, when the Greek astrologer Palchus, practicing in Smyrna, Turkey, was asked about the fate of a ship at sea. The vessel was bringing a shipment of goods from Alexandria and was significantly overdue. Had the ship been lost at sea? At first the querent did not tell the astrologer the nature of his concern, and Palchus had to guess it from the chart. </p>
<p class="tx">This horoscope is important because it shows how horary was practiced in the formative days of the art. The symbolism of astrology has evolved over the centuries, and modern astrologers might be hard-pressed to come up with the same detailed delineations that Palchus made during the fifth century.</p>
<p class="tx">I reconstructed the horoscope using information from Palchus’s delineation translated by Richard Garnett in 1899 and the data in <span class="ital">Greek Horoscopes</span> by Neugebauer and Van Hoesen (see chart 9, which we will look at in depth shortly). The computer-generated chart differs slightly from the one used by Palchus, who did not have access to a modern ephemeris. The chart is cast with Whole Sign houses (the standard house system among Hellenistic astrologers) for Saturday, 14 July 479 CE at 8:10 a.m. LMT in Smyrna, Turkey. I decided on 8:10 a.m. LMT because the chart has early Virgo rising and the Lot of Fortune lies at the end of Sagittarius. By modern calculations, <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae </span>moved into Capricorn at 8:14 a.m. LMT, so the chart had to be cast a few minutes prior to that time.</p>
<p class="tx">It is a Saturn day during a Mars hour. In Hellenistic astrology, Mars and Saturn are the two malefic planets, Mars being more malevolent when the Sun is above the horizon and Saturn being most maleficent when the Sun is below the horizon. In this daytime horary, with the morning Sun in the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, Mars is poised to do substantial mischief. Fortunately, the <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>wo benefic planets (Jupiter and Venus) are ready to counterbalance the malefics. Jupiter (th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> greater benefic and a diurnal planet) is at his best when the Sun is above the horizon, and Venus (the lesser benefic and a nocturnal planet) does her fortunate best during the nighttime hours.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Day and Night Charts, and the Part of Fortune</p>
<p class="txni">A fundamental concept in Hellenistic astrology is the division between day and night. During the day, the Sun is the major Light in the sky, and the sun’s beams obscure all the stars <span class="CharOverride-4">i</span>n the universe, although the Moon can often be seen moving faintly across the sky. At night, the Moon reigns supreme and is by far the brightest Light amidst all the twinkling <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page47" title="47"></span>stars and visible planets in the sky. The Sun and the Moon are the two major “Lights,” or “Luminaries,” in astrology.</p>
<p class="tx">The dividing line between day and night is the horizon, a horizontal line that stretches from east to west across the horoscopic chart. Sunrise occurs as the Sun ascends above the eastern horizon, initiating the daylight hours. Nighttime begins when the Sun descends below the western horizon. In Egyptian mythology, the sun god dies every night as he descends below the horizon in the west and is reborn every morning as he rises from th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">d</span>ead across the eastern horizon. Christianity later borrowed from this ancient Egyptian symbolism to describe the death and resurrection of Jesus. </p>
<p class="tx">The horoscopic point of ascension in the east came to be called the <span class="ital">ascending degree</span>, and its zodiac sign, the <span class="ital">ascending sign</span>. Both the degree ascending and the sign rising were referre<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> to as the <span class="ital">Ascendant</span>. Borrowing from the symbolism of sunrise, the Ascendant represents the birth, life, and vitality of the organism whose horoscope is under consideration.</p>
<p class="tx">If the degree of the zodiac rising in the east has a special symbolic connection with sunrise, what about the Moon? Is there a similar point in the horoscope whose relationship to the Moon is analogous to the relation that the Sun forms with the ascending degree? The ancient astrologers invented such a point and called it the <span class="ital">Lot of Fortune</span> (aka Part of Fortune, <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae</span>, or simply Fortuna). Symbolically, the Sun represents the divine spark of life and the Ascendant signifies the life and viability of the native. The Part of Fortune was sometimes called the “ascendant of the Moon,” and in a day chart, it lies in ecliptic longitude as far from the Ascendant as does the Sun from the Moon.</p>
<p class="tx">By analogy, the Moon represents the human body, which is composed of matter infused with the divine solar spark of life. The Sun has to do with soul and spirit. The Moon, by contrast, is related to matter and the body. Thus, the Lot of Fortune (which by analogy with the Sun acts like an “Ascendant” for the Moon) symbolizes the material fortune or prosperity of the native.</p>
<p class="tx">The formula for <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae </span>can be derived as follows. The Ascendant is as far from the Sun (expressed mathematically as Ascendant − Sun) as the Lot of Fortune is from the Moon (expressed mathematically as Fortuna − Moon). Thus, we get this formula:</p>
<p class="tx-sa-center">Fortuna − Moon = Ascendant − Sun</p>
<p class="tx-sa">And if we add the Moon to both sides of the equation, we get this: </p>
<p class="tx-sa-center-bold"><span class="med">Fortuna = Ascendant + Moon </span><span class="med">−</span><span class="med"> Sun</span></p>
<p class="tx-sa"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page48" title="48"></span>There is a further twist to the formula. It appears that the ancient Greeks as well as the medieval astrologers (but not William Lilly in the seventeenth century) reversed the for<span class="CharOverride-4">m</span>ula, switching the positions of the Sun and Moon, in night charts. Apparently, the Moon rules the night skies and the Ascendant in a night chart properly belongs to the Moo<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">r</span>ather than the Sun. Thus, a special analogous Part, or Lot, has to be calculated for the Su<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> when it is below the horizon (see Hand 1996):</p>
<p class="tx-sa"><span class="ital">For day births:</span> Fortuna = Ascendant + Moon − Sun</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-4">F</span><span class="ital">or night births:</span> Fortuna = Ascendant + Sun − Moon</p>
<p class="tx-sa">Because Lilly did not vary the formula for day and night charts, his Part of Fortune by night is really the Hellenistic <span class="ital">Part of Spirit</span>, which has a different connotation and will give misleading results in night charts. For example, John Frawley, who uses Lilly’s daytime Part of Fortune in night charts, states that in missing item horaries, “Fortuna can be ignored” (Frawley 2014, 132, 170). This statement may be based on using the Part of Spirit <span class="CharOverride-4">i</span>n place of the Part of Fortune in his nighttime charts.</p>
<p class="tx">Hellenistic astrologers regarded the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant as the three most important points in the chart. The Part of Fortune is an algebraic combination of these key points and was deemed worthy of careful study in delineating a horoscope. The Part of Fortune is especially related to the Moon, our physical bodies, and our material fortune. Palchus begins his interpretation of this horary chart with the Lot of Fortune.</p>
<p class="tx">The client does not tell Palchus the nature of his concern, forcing the astrologer to turn to the chart to guess what’s going on (<a href="HA-4.html">Chart 9</a>). Palchus begins with the Lot of Fortune, which represents the querent’s material fortune. He tells us that <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae </span>in Sagittarius rises with the ancient constellation Argo Navis. (<span class="ital">Argo</span> was the ship used by Jason and the <span class="ital">Argo</span>nauts during their hazardous sea voyage. Ben Affleck’s 2012 movie <span class="ital">Argo</span> describes a perilous journey to Iran.) The ruler of the Lot of Fortune is Jupiter, which is posited in Aquarius, the Water Bearer, a sign associated with heavy rains and flooding. Using the symbolism of his epoch, which would probably be inaccessible to modern astrologers, Palchus concludes that the querent is worried about a dangerous sea voyage (the journey of the Argo) that could adversely affect his material well-being.</p>
<p class="tx">Next Palchus turns to the planetary rulers of the day (Saturday) and the hour (Mars) at the time when the querent asked the question of the astrologer. Both rulers are traditional malefic planets—not a good omen. One of the fascinating things about horary is that the querent instinctively picks a time to ask a question, and the chart cast for that time reflects the nature of what is going on. In this case, if the querent had delayed but a quarter hour in approaching the astrologer, the “Lord” of the hour would have been the more benevolent Sun instead of malefic Mars.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>Chart 9: Palchus: Safety of a Ship at Sea? <br/>8:10 a.m. LMT, 14 July 479 CE, Smyrna, Turkey. Saturn day, Mars hour. <br/>Whole Sign houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 24° 48' Virgo. Early degree rising.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page50" title="50"></span>Noting that Mars and Saturn are in the ascendant (in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house) and that the Moon applies to Saturn by a major Ptolemaic aspect, Palchus concludes that the ship has encou<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span>tered a violent storm. He does not explain his reasoning, but we know that Mars, a planet of violence, is quite malefic in this chart. The Ascendant and entire 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house symbolize the vitality and safety of the person or matter represented by the chart. Here the Ascendant refers to the ship itself and to its viability during a sea voyage.</p>
<p class="tx">Next Palchus argues that the ship escaped the violent storm intact because Jupiter (the greater benefic) beholds Venus (the lesser benefic) as well as the Moon. Jupiter in Aquarius beholds Venus in Gemini because their two signs are in trine, and Jupiter beholds the Moon in Scorpio because Aquarius lies in square aspect with Scorpio. Palchus does not explai<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> exactly his reasoning about the Moon, which he appears to be using as a co-significator of the ship. Perhaps he is also thinking that the Moon affects the tides, resides in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house (a travel house where the Moon rejoices), and by exaltation rules the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of voyages <span class="CharOverride-4">(</span>Moon exalted in Taurus). </p>
<p class="tx">Next Palchus turns his attention to the Ascendant in Virgo, a “bi-corporeal” sign. Mercury rules the Virgo Ascendant and is retrograde (that is, appears to be going backward in the zodiac). For obvious reasons, retrograde planets are often interpreted as meaning backward motion, regression, or return to a prior position. The ruler of the Taurus Midheaven is Venus, who resides in bi-corporeal Gemini, the sign of the Twins. <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae </span>lies in bi-corporeal Sagittarius, and the Moon’s dispositor, Mars, lies in bi-corporeal Virgo. </p>
<p class="tx">The ancients referred to the mutable signs as <span class="ital">bi-corporeal</span> because they were represented in the zodiac by two bodies or two body parts. Virgo was pictured as a maiden with birdlike wings. Gemini consisted of twins, one mortal and the other immortal. Sagittarius was half-man and half-horse. Finally, Pisces consisted of two fish swimming in opposite directions.</p>
<p class="tx">Seeing all of this two-bodied symbolism, Palchus concludes that the ship’s crew went back to port (Mercury retrograde) to change to another ship (bi-corporeal emphasis) <span class="CharOverride-4">b</span>ecause the original vessel was damaged in the storm, which he mentioned earlier in the delineation. Although Palchus does not spell it out, his idea can also be seen in the fact that Venus rules the Midheaven (worldly success) and occupies Gemini (the fraternal Twins) in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of trade and commerce. Symbolically, the success of the professional ve<span class="CharOverride-4">nt</span>ure involves duality (Gemini), which manifests in the use of two similar ships to accomplish the task.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page51" title="51"></span>Palchus continues to elaborate the bi-corporeal symbolism. Because the maiden of Virgo has wings, the ship must be carrying birds. By the way, this bird symbolism can be seen in the Waite-Smith Tarot in the Nine of Pentacles card, which depicts a maiden holding a bird—a card that the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn associated with Venus in Virgo. </p>
<p class="tx">Because the Moon in <a href="HA-4.html">Chart 9</a> lies in Scorpio, which is the domicile of Mars, there are some brazen vessels on board. With the Moon in the terms (in the Egyptian system of bounds) of Mercury, one would expect books and papers amidst the cargo. In addition, the constellation Asclepius (Ophiuchus, the “13<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> constellation” of the zodiac circle) rises with the Moon in this chart, so medical supplies would be on board. Asclepius was a great healer and physician.</p>
<p class="tx">If Palchus had used the system of bounds (terms) that William Lilly adopted from Ptolemy, the Moon would have been in the terms of Venus rather than Mercury; and instead of Mercury-ruled books and papers, perhaps fancy clothing and kinky sex toys woul<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> have been part of the load. Different systems of bounds yield different interpretations. It’s not clear which, if any, system of bounds is reliable and will yield valid results in chart interpretation. Historically, the Egyptian system of terms is mentioned by more than one <span class="CharOverride-4">i</span>ndependent source, and it is the only system known to be employed in archeologically recovered horoscopes like the one by Palchus that we are currently reviewing.</p>
<p class="tx">As mentioned, Palchus used the Egyptian system of bounds and found that the Moon at 18<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Scorpio was in the terms of Mercury (from 11 to 19 degrees of Scorpio). As you ca<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> see in the following table, Lilly would have placed the Moon in the terms of Venus (from 14 to 21 degrees of Scorpio).</p>

<p class="tx">Much seems to depend of the whim of the astrologer as to which set of terms they find appealing. The concept of <span class="ital">terms</span>, or <span class="ital">bounds</span>, originated in Babylonian astrology and underwent many variations over time (Jones and Steele 2011). In the seventeenth century, Morinus, a contemporary of Lilly, studied the literature and decided not to use the terms because he felt they were superstitious nonsense. The great Ptolemy himself not a practicing astrologer, and, at least regarding the terms/bounds, he appears to have been out of step with the standard of practice among the consulting astrologers of his epoch.</p>

<p class="tx">Let’s return to Palchus and his client, who is now feeling reassured that the vessel from Alexandria did not sink at sea. He wants to know when it will arrive. Palchus tells him that the ship will come in when the Moon reaches Aquarius or Pisces: Aquarius because in 7 days the Part of Fortune will be in Pisces and the Moon, now in Aquarius, will conjoin Jupiter, which rules Pisces (<a href="HA-4.html">Table 6</a>). Apparently Hellenistic astrologers believed that the chart for the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> day after the question was especially important. A glance at the ephemeris for July 479 CE shows the Moon moving away from the Sun, thus increasing the distance of the Part of Fortune from the Ascendant in this horary. The Moon reaches Aquarius in 7 days and Pisces in 9 days.</p>

<p class="tx">In fact, the ship arrived in port on the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> day, when the Moon was in the latter part of Aquarius. According to Palchus, the sailors confirmed his interpretation of the chart. They had been in a violent storm that had tossed their ship against a rock, breaking the prow. Fortunately, they got back to a harbor and switched their cargo to a different vessel, which they were now sailing. The cargo consisted of birds, blank writing paper, brazen cooking vessels, and medicines, as Palchus had seen in the chart. There was no mention of sex toys being among the load.</p>
<p class="Ahead">How Would Lilly Have Analyzed Palchus’s Chart <br/>in the Seventeenth Century?</p>
<p class="txni">Let’s briefly look at how Lilly might have analyzed this chart. Lilly would have cast the chart with Regiomontanus rather than Whole Sign houses. All the other data would b<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> the same: 14 July 479 CE at 8:10 a.m. LMT in Smyrna, Turkey, a Saturn day during a Mars hour (<a href="HA-12.html">Chapter 12</a>).</p>
<p class="tx">It is clear from his examples that Lilly treats missing ships as if they were living beings. Regarding a similar question, Lilly writes: </p>
<p class="Q4">A friend of the Merchant propounds the question unto me, <span class="ital">What I thought of the ship, if sunk or living?</span> whereupon I erected the figure preceding, and … gave my opinion, that <span class="ital">the Ship was not lost, but did live, and though of late in some danger, yet was now recovered.</span> (<span class="ital">CA</span> 162)</p>

<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page59" title="59"></span>To interpret the chart, Lilly uses the same logic as in his discussion about “<span class="ital">whether one absent be dead or alive” </span>(<span class="ital">CA</span> 151).</p>
<p class="tx">According to Lilly, </p>
<p class="Q4">generally, the Sign ascending and the Moon are Significators of the Ship, and what Goods are in her, the Lord of the Ascendant of those that sail in her. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 157)</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly indicates that the Ascending sign and the Moon represent the ship and its cargo, and the planetary ruler of the Ascendant signifies the ship’s sailors. In another horary example, Lilly notes that </p>
<p class="Q4">the Ascendant and the Moon are Significators of the Ship and those that sail in her. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 165)</p>
<p class="tx">In Palchus’s chart, the Virgo Ascendant, its ruler, Mercury, and the Moon would signify the ship, its goods, and the seamen. To determine the fate of the ship, Lilly addresses a series of questions about these significators (the ascending sign, the ruler of the Ascendant, and the Moon):</p>
<p class="list1">• Is a malevolent planet placed in the Ascendant?</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> If so, does the malefic have dignities in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death?</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Is the ruler of the Ascendant in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>? </p>
<p class="list3"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Is the ruler of the Ascendant in an ill configuration with the ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, or 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, or is the Moon combust or under the Earth? </p>
<p class="tx">The 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> and 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> are traditionally the “unfortunate” houses. The 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> is the house of final endings, shipwrecks, and the grave. A combust Moon is damaged by the hot rays <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>f the Sun. Being under the Earth (under the horizon) implies a location below sea level, which is not good if you’re a ship.</p>
<p class="tx">In responding to Lilly’s questions, we could say the following:</p>
<p class="list1">• The malevolent planets Mars and Saturn occupy the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house. </p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> The 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (Regiomontanus) has 26<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 07' of Pisces on its cusp. In Lilly’s system of dignities, the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp of the Palchus chart lies in the triplicity, term/bound, and face of Mars.</p>
<p class="list2">• The Moon is below the horizon in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> (a travel house). This is a negative indicator, because the Moon signifies the ship, and its location below the horizon suggests that the vessel has sunk below the level of the sea and cannot see the light of day. </p>
<p class="list3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page60" title="60"></span>• The ruler of the Ascendant (Mercury) in not in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, but it applies to an opposition with 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> ruler Jupiter, which is retrograde and peregrine (without essential dignity) in the unfortunate 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. This opposition looks quite ominous, because Mercury rules the Ascendant and Jupiter governs the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death. It’s not nic<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> when the ruler of death opposes your significator.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly says that if the answers to all of the above questions are in the affirmative, then the ship is lost and the sailors drowned: </p>
<p class="Q4">If in the Question demanded you find all these unfortunate … you may judge the Ship is lost and the men drowned (lest you find reception betwixt themselves) for then the Ship was casually shipwrecked, and some of the seamen did escape. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 157)</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-4">S</span>ince not all of the above criteria are met, I assume Lilly would judge that the ship got into difficulty but was not entirely lost. </p>
<p class="tx">A look at the transiting aspects tells more of the story (<a href="HA-4.html">Table 7</a>). Prior to the horary question of July 14, Mercury (Ascendant ruler, the ship) opposed Jupiter (8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> ruler) on Jul<span class="CharOverride-4">y</span> 7, probably symbolizing the storm that had damaged the ship.</p>

<p class="tx">Later in the day on July 14 (the day of the horary question), Venus perfected a trine to Jupiter. Benefic Venus in this chart is powerful in the angular 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. Venus is fortified in her beneficence by a trine from the greater benefic Jupiter, so she is capable of doing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page61" title="61"></span>much good to save the day. In addition, Venus is in reception by triplicity with Saturn and in reception by face with Jupiter. These receptions do much to mitigate the malefic connotations of Saturn and Jupiter in this chart. Venus is exalted in Pisces (on the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp) and mutually applies to a trine with Jupiter, the ruler of Pisces. </p>
<p class="tx">The day after the horary question, Mercury (the ship) perfects a favorable sextile to benefic Venus in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. Thus, despite the difficulties the vessel had encountered (Mercury opposed Jupiter on July 7, prior to the horary question), the future of the sea voyage looks bright (Mercury sextile Venus in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> on July 14). Fortunately, Jupiter (ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) is not particularly strong in this chart, being retrograde, in a cadent house, and without essential dignity.</p>
