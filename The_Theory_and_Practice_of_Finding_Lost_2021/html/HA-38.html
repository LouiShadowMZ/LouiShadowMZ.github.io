<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-43">WHERE ARE THE MISSING USB DRIVES?</p>
<p class="txni">This question was asked by Del Strachen in a horary discussion group to which I belong. Del kindly gave his permission to use the chart in this text. Here is what he posted:</p>
<p class="Q4">Hello this is my question, I am the Querent. I have misplaced my USB drives. Where are they? The date of me drawing the chart is September 10, 2015 at 8:09 a.m. AEST (-10:00), Sydney, Australia (33S52, 151E13).</p>
<p class="tx">Del cast the chart using <span class="ital">Porphyry</span> houses (<a href="HA-38.html">Chart 42a</a>). He found the USB drives sixteen minutes later, at 8:25 a.m., not long after studying the indications in the horary chart.</p>
<p class="tx">It is a Jupiter day during a Sun hour. An early degree of Scorpio rises, making Mars the ruler of the querent. The Ascendant lies in the <span class="ital">via combusta.</span></p>
<p class="tx">In the Porphyry house system, Scorpio also rules the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp of his possessions, so Mars also rules the missing USB drives. If he had used Placidus or Regiomontanus houses, Sagittarius would have been on the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> cusp, making Jupiter the ruler of his movable goods; but since I was interpreting a chart he had already cast, I stuck with his choice of Porphyry houses. </p>
<p class="tx">The 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>-ruler Mars in Leo (a Fire sign ruled by the Sun) suggests a location near heat or light. Sometimes Leo refers to an outdoor location such as a park. Mars close to the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp suggests an 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house location (perhaps with a friend or the child of a partner, 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>). A position near the cusp can mean a location near a door, window, or threshold between rooms. Fire signs often suggest a location near a wall or partition. </p>
<p class="tx">Fiery Mars and sunny Leo suggest that the USB drives may be near something red or bright orange in color. Saturn (gravity) near the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house could mean he dropped them. Most of Sagittarius in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house suggests Jupiter as a co-ruler of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> missing items. Jupiter in Virgo in the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (the joy of Jupiter) could mean a location <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page290" title="290"></span>inside a drawer, pocket, cabinet, or container of some kind, possibly made of iron or steel (Mars in Leo). Virgo loves to organize and file things in neat compartments. </p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"></a>Chart 42a: Del’s Missing USB Drives (Porphyry Houses) <br/>10 September 2015, 8:09 a.m. AEST, Sydney, Australia. Jupiter day, Sun hour. <br/>Dwad of Ascendant is at 3<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 48' Sagittarius. Early degree rising.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page291" title="291"></span>Jupiter (co-ruler of the missing items) in the house of his greatest joy (the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) indicates that the USBs are in good condition, and is also an argument that the USBs will be found, especially since the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house signifies the querent’s hopes and wishes in the matter. Jupiter under the sunbeams indicates that the USBs are likely obscured from view and not easily seen. </p>
<p class="tx">Saturn in Scorpio suggests a dark place. The Moon (co-ruler of the querent) applies to 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>-ruler Mars, and Mars (ruler of the Ascendant) applies to Saturn at the cusp of the 2nd, s<span class="CharOverride-4">o</span> the missing items certainly will be found. Mars in a fixed sign suggests a hidden location low down in a room. Jupiter in a mutable Earth sign suggests it is in the house near the floor.</p>
<p class="tx">Del responded to my analysis of his horary chart as follows: </p>
<p class="Q4">You are on the money. I have been moving my stuff from my old flat into storage. I am currently cat-sitting in a house that belongs to a woman with two kids. So I have been using a black storage container. It is about a meter from the front door. And it was next to a backpack that was off white but has an orange bit that is about half of the front. Yes, it was also on the floor. It was in a black storage container. I checked the storage container because I ran out of places to look.</p>
<p class="tx">Having read Del’s comment about cat-sitting, I noticed that Jupiter (ruler of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of small animals) lies in the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of friends with Ascendant-ruler Mars (the querent). This kind of confirmatory detail is further evidence that the chart is radical.</p>
<p class="tx">Sometimes colors are helpful in locating lost objects. In this case, the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler is Mars, a red planet, in Leo (color of the Sun), and by the 5-degree rule, Mars is under the influence of the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp (yellow or yellow-orange). The plurality of color testimonies suggests that the missing item is near something in the yellow-orange-red spectrum. It was actually in a black storage container, however, which is indicated by Jupiter in Virgo in the 11th house. Jupiter rules Sagittarius, which occupies most of the Porphyry 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house and is on the cusp of the Placidus and Regiomontanus 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house. Virgo often indicates a location in a drawer, container, or box, and is associated with very dark or black colors. Saturn in Scorpio on the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house also suggests a very dark or black color.</p>
<p class="tx">The dispositor of the Part of Fortune can co-signify the querent’s goods. Here, Fortuna in Virgo is ruled by Mercury in Libra in the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. The Moon (the querent’s co-ruler) applies to sextile Mercury from the angular 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house without impediment, suggesting recovery of the item.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page292" title="292"></span>Regarding the early degree on the Ascendant and the late degree on the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> Porphyry house cusp in the horary chart, we should consider the observations of Alphee Lavoie (1995) that the misplaced article may be</p>
<p class="list1">• near a door, window, or gate;</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bl2">in a box, package, or container; and/or<p class="list3 _idGenParaOverride-1">• about to be moved.</p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">In this case, Alphee’s findings are spot-on. The querent was in the process of moving his belongings, and he found the missing USBs in a storage container near the front door.</p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">Would it have made a difference if the astrologer had chosen to use Regiomontanus houses (Lilly’s favorite) instead of Porphyry? Here is the same horary cast with Regiomontanus houses (chart 42b).</p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">Mars still rules the Ascendant and signifies the querent, but Jupiter rules the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp and signifies the missing USBs. Jupiter in Virgo (a dark-colored or black container) in the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of friends suggests a location in a friend’s house. The Moon (co-signifying <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he querent) lies at the end of the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and is entering the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, suggesting movement of the querent from his own place to the location of a friend. By the 5-degree rule, the Moon would be regarded as being under the influence of the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp; and non<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> of the relevant significators would occupy an angular house, suggesting that the missing USBs may not be in the querent’s own home. </p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">It seems that either chart would lead to the same conclusions, but, at least in this case, the Regiomontanus chart is a little more direct than the one with Porphyry houses.</p><p class="caption-center _idGenParaOverride-2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page293" title="293"></span></p><div class="chart-nsa" id="_idContainer241"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-8" src="../resources/Chart42bMissingUsbDrivesRegiomontanus.jpg"/></div><p class="caption-center _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"></a>Chart 42b: Del’s Missing USB Drives (Regiomontanus Houses) <br/>10 September 2015, 8:09 a.m. AEST, Sydney, Australia.
