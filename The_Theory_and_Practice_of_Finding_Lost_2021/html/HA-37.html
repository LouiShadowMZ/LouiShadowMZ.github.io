<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-42">BOYS MISSING IN JUPITER, FLORIDA</p>
<p class="txni">According to Lilly: “If a question be demanded of one absent in a general way, and the querent has no relation to the party; then the first House, the Lord of the House and th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Moon shall signify the absent party; and the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House or planet posited either in the House or within five degrees of the Cusp of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House shall show his death or its quality”(<span class="ital">CA</span> 151).</p>
<p class="tx">On July 24, 2015, two teenage boys set out in their fishing boat from a marina in Jupiter, Florida, never to return. Apparently, an unexpected squall capsized their boat in the Atlantic Ocean close to the level of Florida’s border with Georgia. Air spotters reportedly saw a makeshift raft in the vicinity, but the boys were never found. As in the case in the previous chapter, we cast an event chart for the exact time that the missing fourteen-year-olds were last seen, namely, 24 July 2015 at 1:30 p.m. EDT, Jupiter, Florida (<a href="HA-37.html">Chart 41a</a>). It is a Venus day during a Sun hour. In such a chart, the Ascendant represents the missing boys.</p>
<p class="tx">This is a troubling chart. Scorpio rules the Ascendant, making Mars the significator of the missing teenagers. On the positive side, with Mars in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, Lilly’s dictum—namely, that the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house ruler in houses 9, 10, or 11 suggests that the missing person is probably alive (<span class="ital">CA</span> 151)—applies to this chart. </p>
<p class="tx">On the other hand, both the Ascendant and the Moon lie in the <span class="ital">via combusta</span>, an unlucky region associated with misfortune, deprivation of light, and matters being obscured or kept secret. Sahl says that Luna in the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> is one of the worst impediments of the Moon and is especially harmful in charts related to embarking on marriage, <span class="CharOverride-4">m</span>atters related to women, buying and selling, or long-distance travel (Dykes translation 2008, 194). Also in this chart, Mars (the missing persons) occupies the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of long journeys and very closely applies to square Uranus (sudden accidents) in the unfortunate 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"></a>Chart 41a: Boys Last Seen in Jupiter, Florida (Event Chart) <br/>24 July 2015, 1:30 p.m. EDT, Jupiter, Florida. Venus day.

<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page287" title="287"></span>In astrology, the <span class="ital">contra-antiscion</span> of any point is its reflection across the axis connecting 0<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Libra and 0<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Aries. In other words, a point and its contra-antiscion are equally distant from the 0<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Libra/0<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Aries axis. Contra-antiscions act like stressful oppositions between planets. The contra-antiscion of radical Neptune closely conjoins Uranus in the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (an accident at sea, possible drowning). Radical Neptune is disposed by Jupiter, which squares Saturn, ruler of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of final endings. The contra-antiscion of the Ascendant at 29<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 23' Leo conjoins stationary Venus at 0<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 45' Virgo, ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death and the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of undoing. The contra-antiscion of the Sun, a natural signifier of life <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>nd vitality, conjoins radical Saturn (a natural symbol of death and ruler of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of endings) at the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house. The contra-antiscion of radical Saturn conjoins the radical Sun at the Midheaven, the most prominent point in the chart. <a href="HA-37.html">Chart 41b</a> shows th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> natal planets in the inside wheel, surrounded by their contra-antiscia in the outer wheel.</p>
<p class="tx">In addition, Mars conjoins the fixed star Castor, the mortal Gemini twin who died and went to heaven to be with his immortal brother. Some authors view Castor as an unfortunate fixed star of the nature of Saturn, Mars, and Venus. The Arabic parts file generated by Solar Fire reveals two significant contacts: the <span class="ital">Part of Danger</span> (3<span class="CharOverride-6"> o</span> 02’ Leo) conjoins Mercur<span class="CharOverride-4">y</span> (ruler of the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of sea voyages), and the <span class="ital">Part of Catastrophe</span> (19<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 35’ Cancer) conjoins Ascendant-ruler Mars (the missing boys).</p>
<p class="tx">When I first looked at this chart, I hoped that through some miracle the boys would be found alive, but the chart suggested an unexpected accident in which the teens probably drowned and were washed out to sea. As the search proceeded, the Coast Guard found their nineteen-foot fishing boat about sixty-five miles east of Daytona Beach on July 26. The Coast Guard called off their search for the missing teens on 31 July 2015. In early August, two life jackets and a seat cushion allegedly belonging to the boys’ boat were found near Savannah, Georgia. A trained dog apparently detected the scent of one of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> boys on the life jacket. The family called off their private search on 9 August 2015 and decided to set up a foundation to promote boat safety in honor of the lost boys.</p>
