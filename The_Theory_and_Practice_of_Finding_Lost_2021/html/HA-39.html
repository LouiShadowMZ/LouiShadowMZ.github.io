<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-44">WHERE IS THE MISSING IPAD?</p>
<p class="txni">One Monday, 18 August 2014, I received a phone call from the sister of a good friend who asked if I could do a chart to locate a missing iPad. Her son was the last person to use the iPad, and he insisted that he had left it on the desk in his father’s study. She asked the question at 12:21 p.m. EDT. I put up the chart on my computer and continued the phone call with the querent. This chart is set for my location, 41N17, 73W02 (<a href="HA-39.html">Chart 43</a>).</p>
<p class="tx">It is a Moon day during a Venus hour. </p>
<p class="tx">Scorpio rises, making Mars the significator of the querent. Mars and Saturn, both in Scorpio, occupy the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house.</p>
<p class="tx">The querent’s Sagittarius 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of possessions is ruled by Jupiter. </p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-4">T</span>he querent had purchased the iPad <span class="ital">for the family</span>, and thus there are three co-owners of the device. Her son was the person to use it, and he is represented by the Pisces 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (ruled by Jupiter, with Mars as almuten of the cusp). The son’s 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house is the radical Aries 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, ruled by Mars. </p>
<p class="tx">The querent’s husband is shown by the Taurus 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp, making Venus his ruler. Since Gemini is on the cusp of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, Mercury is also a potential ruler of the iPad if we regard it as a possession of her husband. Mercury in Leo is in the radical 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, which is her husband’s derived 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>). The querent said that the iPad was usually kept in his home office.</p>
<p class="tx">If we view the iPad as a family possession, the family is shown by the Aquarius 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, ruled by Saturn; and the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> is the radical Pisces 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, ruled by Jupiter. Both Jupiter and Saturn are peregrine (without essential dignity), and Jupiter applies to square Saturn from the sign of Saturn’s detriment, an argument that it will not be found <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>ince Jupiter occupies a place where Saturn is debilitated and without resources to accomplish its goals.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"></a>Chart 43: Missing iPad <br/>18 August 2014, 12:21 p.m. EDT, 41N17, 073W02. Moon day, Venus hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 12<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 48' Aquarius.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page297" title="297"></span>The ruler of the querent’s 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house is Jupiter in the cadent 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house in Leo, so I asked her if the missing iPad could be in a distant place (the cadent 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>), perhaps a park or outdoor area (Leo—where the wild things are) or an indoor location that has a view of the outdoors. She said that her son had recently attended a religious-oriented sleepaway summer program but had insisted that he did not take the iPad with him to camp. Since Jupiter in Leo signifies both the missing iPad (2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house) and her son (5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house), I asked if it was possible that her son had taken the iPad with him to camp but was reluctant to say so because it had been lost or stolen (Jupiter conjunct Venus, ruler of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of thieves and the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of undoing and misfortune).</p>
<p class="tx">Seeing the Moon in Gemini in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death and separating from Mercury, the ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, I wondered if the iPad could have been left in a car or bus during transit, or in a library or place devoted to education. She said they had searched their car to no avail, and the only library or place of learning she could think of was her husband’s home office<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> where the iPad was normally kept.</p>
<p class="tx">Jupiter (ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> and 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> houses) is cadent and peregrine (without essential dignity). The querent’s primary significator, Mars, is separating from a square to Jupiter, su<span class="CharOverride-4">g</span>gesting that the iPad will not be recovered. Her co-ruler Moon in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of loss is separating from a sextile to Jupiter in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of distant places and religion, again <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>uggesting that the iPad was probably lost at the religious summer camp.</p>
<p class="tx">From the testimony of these aspects, I judged that the iPad had probably been lost at the camp and would not be recovered, or, if recovered, would be in poor condition due to <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he cadent, peregrine status of Jupiter. </p>
<p class="tx">The querent called a couple months later to confirm that the iPad had never been found. She and her husband concluded that their son probably lost the iPad at camp and that he either forgot he had it with him or was too ashamed to tell them because it was such an expensive item.</p>
