<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-48">LILLY AND GADBURY <br/>ON THE HOUSES IN HORARY</p>
<p class="txni">The following text is from chapters 6 and 7 of Lilly’s <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span>, with the corresponding comments of Gadbury, from his <span class="ital">Doctrine of Horary Questions</span>, inserted in brackets at the end of each section. I have included these quotations because a thorough understanding of the astrological houses is essential to the accurate interpretation of a horary chart.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Lilly: Chapter VI: Of the Twelve Houses of Heaven, <br/>and Some Names or Terms of Astrologie (<span class="skew">CA</span> 48)</p>
<p class="Q1">The first, tenth, seventh and fourth houses hereof are called Angles; the eleventh, second, eighth &amp; fifth are called Succedents; the third, twelfth, ninth and sixth, are termed Cadents. </p>
<p class="Q2">The Angles are most powerful, the Succedents are next in virtue, the Cadents poor, and of little efficacy: the Succedent houses follow the Angles, the Cadent<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> come next the Succedents; in force and virtue they stand so in order: </p>
<p class="tx-sa-center">1 – 10 – 7 – 4 – 11 – 5 – 9 – 3 – 2 – 9 – 6 – 12</p>
<p class="Q1-tx">The meaning whereof is this, that two Planets equally dignified, the one in the Ascendant, the other in the tenth house, you shall judge the Planet in the Ascendant somewhat of more power to effect what he is Significator of, then he that is in the tenth: do so in the rest as they stand in order, remembering that Planets in Angles do more forcibly shew their effects. </p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page312" title="312"></span>Lilly: Chapter VII: Of the Twelve Houses, <br/>Their Nature and Signification (<span class="skew">CA</span> 50–56)</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">As before we have said there are twelve signs, and also twelve Houses of Heaven, so now we are come to relate the nature of these twelve Houses; the exact knowledge whereof is so requisite, that he who shall learn the nature of the Planets and Signs <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>ithout exact judgment of the Houses, is like an improvident man, that furnishe<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>ith variety of household stuff, having no place wherein to bestow them. </p>
<p class="Q2">There is nothing appertaining to the life of man in this world, which in one way or other has no relation to one of the twelve Houses of Heaven, and as th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> twelve signs are appropriate to the particular members of man’s body; so also do <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he twelve houses represent not only the several parts of man, but his actions, quality of life and living, and the curiosity and judgment of our Forefathers in Astrology, was such, as they have allotted to every house a particular signification, and so distinguished humane accidents throughout the twelve houses, as he that understands the Questions appertaining to each of them, shall not want sufficien<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> grounds whereon to judge or give a rational answer upon any contingent accident, and success thereof. </p>
<p class="Bhead-indents">Of the First House and Its Signification </p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">The first house, which contains all that part of Heaven from the line where the figure one standeth, until the figure two, where the second house begins. </p>
<p class="Q2">It hath signification of the life of man, of the stature, colour, complexion, form and shape of him that propounds the Question, or is born; in Eclipses and great Conjunctions, and upon the Sun his annual ingress into Aries; it signifies the common people, or general State of that Kingdom where the Figure is erected. </p>
<p class="Q2">And as it is the first house, it represents the head and face of man, so that if either Saturn, Mars or South Node be in this House, either at the time of the Question, or at the time of birth, you shall observe some blemish in the face, or in that member appropriate to the sign that then is upon the cusp of the house; as if Aries be in the Ascendant, the mark, mole, or scar is without fail in the head or face; and if few degrees of the sign ascend, the mark is in the upper part of the head; if the middle of the sign be on the cusp, the mole, mark or scar is in the middle o<span class="CharOverride-4">f</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he face, or near it; if the later degrees ascend, the face is blemished near the chin, <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>owards the neck: This I have found true in hundreds of examples. </p>
<p class="Q2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page313" title="313"></span>Of colors, it hath the White; that is, if a Planet be in this house that hath signification of white, the complexion of the Party is more pale, white and wan; or if you enquire after the colour of the clothes of any man, if his significator be in the first house, and in a sign corresponding, the parties apparel is white or gray, or somewhat near that colour, so also if the Question be for cattle, when their significators are found in this house, it denotes them to be of that colour or near it: The house i<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> Masculine. </p>
<p class="Q2">The Consignificators of this house are Aries and Saturn; for as this house is the first house, so is Aries the first sign, and Saturn the first of the Planets, and ther<span class="CharOverride-4">ef</span>ore when Saturn is but moderately well-fortified, in this house, and in any benevolent aspect of Jupiter, Venus, Sun or Moon, it promises a good sober constitution of body, and usually long life: Mercury doth also joy in this house, because it represents the Head, and he the Tongue, Fancy and Memory: when he is well dignified and posited in this house, he produces good Orators: it is called the Ascendant, because when the Sun comes to the cusp of this house, he ascends, or then arises<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> and is visible in our Horizon.<span class="ital"> </span></p>
<p class="Q1">[<span class="ital">GADBURY</span>: The 1st House signifies the life of each person, his temperature (temperament) and Corporature; and in Horary Questions hath these Questions proper unto it, viz. </p>
<p class="List-indent">1. Of the length of the Querent’s life. </p>
<p class="List-indent">2. Of the good or evil attending life. </p>
<p class="List-indent">3. When, or in what time shall the Native undergo a change? </p>
<p class="List-indent">4. What part of the Querent’s life is like to be best? </p>
<p class="List-indent">5. Toward what part of the World may he direct his affairs to prosper in them? </p>
<p class="List-indent">6. A person having a mind to speak with another, shall he find him at home<span class="CharOverride-4">?</span> (When you would speak with a person that you have familiar and constant dealings with, and he no ways related unto you; take the 7th house and his Lord to signify him.)</p>
<p class="List-indent">7. Of an absent party, if dead or alive. (Herein you are to consider what relation the Querent hath to the Party Quesited, and take your Significator accordingly … But if there be no relation between them, take the Ascendant, his Lord and the Moon to signify the Party that is absent.)</p>
<p class="List-indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page314" title="314"></span>8. Of a Ship at Sea, her safety or prejudice. (This Question, although by the Ancient Arabian and Latine astrologers it is attributed to the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House, because it relates unto Voyages; yea—as the Learned Mr. Lilly saith—the judgments hereof being chiefly relating to the Ascendant.) ]</p>
<p class="Bhead-indents">Questions Concerning the Second House </p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">From this house is required judgment concerning the estate or fortune of him that asks the question, or his Wealth or Poverty, of all removable Goods, Money lent, of Profit or game, loss or damage; in suits of Law, it signifies a man’s Friends or Assistants; in private Duels, the Querent’s second; in an Eclipse or Great Conjunction, <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he poverty or Wealth of the people; the Sun his entrance into Aries, it represents <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he Ammunition, Allies and Support the Common-wealth shall have; it import<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>heir Magazines. </p>
<p class="Q2">It represents in man the neck, and hinder parts of it towards the shoulders, of colours, the green. </p>
<p class="Q2">So that if one make demand concerning anything specified above in this house, you must look for signification from hence: It’s a feminine house and Succedent<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> called in some Latin Authors <span class="ital">Anaphora</span>. </p>
<p class="Q2">It hath Consignificators Jupiter and Taurus; for if Jupiter be placed in this house, or be Lord hereof, it’s an argument of an estate or fortune; Sun and Mars are never well placed in this house, either of them shew dispersion of substance, according to the capacity and quality of him that is either born or asks the questions. </p>
<p class="Q1">[<span class="ital">GADBURY</span>: The second House is the House of substance … and these Questions following are appropriable thereunto, <span class="ital">viz. </span></p>
<p class="List-indent">1. Shall the Querent be rich or poor? (In resolving this Question, you must observe the Sign of the second and his Lord, the Planet or Planets located therein; and casting rays either to the Cusp or the Lord thereof; the Part of Fortune also, and his position.)</p>
<p class="List-indent">2. By what means shall he attain riches? </p>
<p class="List-indent">3. The time when? </p>
<p class="List-indent">4. Shall he obtain the Goods or Money Lent? </p>
<p class="List-indent">5. If her shall obtain the wages or stipend due? ]</p>
<p class="Bhead-indents"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page315" title="315"></span>The Third House </p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">Hath signification of Brethren, Sisters, Cousins and Kindred, Neighbours, small Journeys, or inland-Journeys, oft removing from one place to another, Epistles, Letters, Rumours, Messengers: It doth rule the Shoulders, Arms, Hands and Fingers. </p>
<p class="Q2">Of Colours, it governs the Red and Yellow, or Croceall, or Sorrell colour: It hath Consignificators, of the Sign Gemini, of the Planet Mars; which is one reason why Mars in this house, unless joined with Saturn is not very unfortunate, it is a Cadent house, and is the joy of the Moon; for if she be posited therein, especially in a movable sign, it’s an argument of much travel, trotting and trudging, or of being seldom quiet: The house is Masculine. </p>
<p class="Q1">[<span class="ital">GADBURY</span> on third house questions: This House judges of Brethren, Sisters, Kindred and Neighbours, &amp;c. and of Inland Journeys and Rumours: and these Questions particularly are proper thereunto. </p>
<p class="List-indent">1. Shall the Querent, and his Brethren, &amp;c. and Neighbours accord? </p>
<p class="List-indent">2. Of the condition and estate of an absent Brother? </p>
<p class="List-indent">3. Shall the Querent’s Inland Journey be prosperous<span class="CharOverride-4">?</span> </p>
<p class="List-indent">4. If reports and rumors noys’d about, be true or false? ]</p>
<p class="Bhead-indents">The Fourth House </p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">Gives Judgment of Fathers in general &amp; ever of his Father that enquires, or that is born; of Lands, Houses, Tenements, Inheritances, Tillage of the earth, Treasure<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> hidden, the determination or end of any thing; Towns, Cities or Castles, besieged or not besieged; all ancient Dwellings, Gardens, Fields, Pastures, Orchards; the quality and nature of the grounds one purchases, whether Vineyards, Cornfield, &amp;c. whether the ground be Woody, Stony or barren. </p>
<p class="Q2">[Later in <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span>, Lilly says “Parents” and includes “Hereditaments” (any inheritable estate or interest in property) and “Treasure-trove, or any thing hid in the ground” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 202).]</p>
<p class="Q2">The Sign of the fourth denotes the Town, the Lord thereof, the Governor: It rules the Breast, Lungs. </p>
<p class="Q2">Of Colours, the Red: Its Consignificator is Cancer, and of Planets the Sun; we call it the Angle of the Earth, or <span class="ital">Imum Coeli</span>; it is feminine, and the North Angle: In Nativities or Questions, this fourth house represents Fathers, so doth the Sun <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page316" title="316"></span>by day and Saturn by night; yet if the Sun be herein placed, he is not ill, but rather shows the Father to be of a noble disposition, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="Q1">[<span class="ital">GADBURY</span>: The fourth house gives judgment of Possessions, Inheritances, Lands, or Houses, and of things hid and mislay’d; of the Father, &amp;c. and hath these Questions proper unto it, viz.</p>

<p class="List-indent">2. Of the Quality thereof, and shall the Querent do well to take it? </p>
<p class="List-indent">3. If it be good for one to remove, or abide where he is? (… you must give the Ascendant, and the Lord thereof, to signify the Querent; the seventh Hous<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> and Lord thereof, to signify the place unto which he would go; the fourth house and his Lord, the House or Land, &amp;c. of the Querent; the tent<span class="CharOverride-4">h</span> House and his Lord, the profit of removal.)</p>
<p class="List-indent">4. Of Treasure hid, if attainable? (Common it is for Persons to hide Treasure, and as common for those that hide a great deal, to forget where some part of it may be; therefore after erection of your Figure, consider what application; reception, translation, &amp;c. there may be between the Lords of the Ascendant and fourth house.)</p>
<p class="List-indent">5. Is there Treasure in the place supposed? (… give the Lord of the Ascendant and the Moon to the Querent for his significators; the fourth house, and the planet or planets posited therein, shall signify the treasure enquired after.)</p>
<p class="List-indent">6. Shall the Querent enjoy the Estate of his Father? </p>
<p class="List-indent">7. Of a thing mislay’d, how or where to find it? ]</p>
<p class="Bhead-indents">The Fifth House </p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">By this house we judge of Children, of Embassadours, of the state of a Woman with child, of Banquets, of Ale-houses, Taverns, Plays, Messengers or Agents for Republic; of the wealth of the Father, the Ammunition of a Town besieged; if the Woman with child shall bring forth male or female; of the health or sickness of his Son or Daughter that asks the Question. </p>
<p class="Q2">It rules the Stomach, Liver, Heart, Sides and Back, and is masculine. </p>
<p class="Q2">Of Colours, Black and White, or Honey-colour, and is a Succedent house; It’s Consignificators are Leo and Venus, who doth joy in this house, in regard it’s the house of Pleasure, Delight and Merriment; it’s wholly unfortunate by Mars or Saturn, and they therein shew disobedient children and untoward. </p>

<p class="Q2">It rules the inferior part of the Belly, and intestines even to The Arse: this house is a Feminine and Cadent house, unfortunate, as having no aspect to the Ascendant. </p>
<p class="Q2">Of Colours, black colour, Mars rejoices in this house, but his Consignificator is of the Signs Virgo, of Planets Mercury; we usually find that Mars and Venus in Conjunction in this house, are arguments of a good Physician. </p>
