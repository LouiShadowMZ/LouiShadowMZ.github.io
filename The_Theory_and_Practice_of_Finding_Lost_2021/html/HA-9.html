<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-14">GADBURY: WHETHER THINGS <br/>LOST WILL BE FOUND</p>
<p class="txni">The following are excerpts from Gadbury’s <span class="ital">Doctrine of Horary Questions, Astrologically Handled</span> (1658). I have modernized some of the seventeenth-century English to make it more readable. The first section deals with fugitives and strays. The second and third sections deal more generally with whether and when missing things or fugitives will be found.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Of the Fugitives or Strays, Shall They Be Found or Not?</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa ParaOverride-7">1. The Moon and Mercury are naturally the Significators of Fugitives and strays: but the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House and his Lord particularly are Significators thereof; unless the thing strayed be a Beast, etc.</p>
<p class="Q2">2. If the Lord of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> thereof shall be Retrograde, the fugitive shall return again of his own accord, before he goes very far from the Querent’s House, or from the place whence he went.</p>
<p class="Q2">3. The Lord of the Ascendant or Moon, in good aspect with the Lord of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, and the Lord of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> apply, it declares the fugitive to be coming home again. If he does not apply, the Querent may find him by enquiry.</p>
<p class="Q2">4. But if the aforesaid Significators behold each other by square or opposition, or shall be in no aspect at all; it denotes the Fugitive unwilling to return again, and an unlikelihood of the Querent’s having him again: If the Lord of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> be in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> or 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, you may say the Fugitive is gone a journey, and will not suddenly be found again.</p>
<p class="Q2">5. If a Horse, Ox or Cow, etc. [large animals] be strayed, observe the Lord of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>; and if he be found Retrograde, you may judge the stray will return of its own accord; and observe the same rules as before, only with the change of the Lord of your House.</p>
<p class="Q2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page86" title="86"></span>6. If the Moon shall transfer the Light of the Lord of the Fugitive or Stray to the Lord of the Ascendant, it argues hopes of recovering them again. If she transfer Mercury’s Light or virtue, &amp;c. it signifies the same.</p>
<p class="Q2">7. The Moon in Good configuration with Jupiter or Venus, or either of them casting a good aspect to the Ascendant or his Lord, from good Houses of the Figure, shows hopes of a recovery.</p>
<p class="Q2">8. The Lord of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House of the Figure or Question, denotes the Fugitive to be under the Bonds of restraint, perhaps in a Prison: Mercury posited so, argues the same.</p>
<p class="Q2">9. When in the Figure you find any Planet separating from the Lord of the House of the Moon, the Beast, etc., strayed is taken into custody and driven away and sold: if any planet shall be found to separate from the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, the same.</p>
<p class="Q2">10. If the Moon or Significator of the Stray, etc., shall apply to the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from his Ascendant, or shall be in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, it is then dead. If the Dispositor of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Moon, or Significator of the Beast shall be posited in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House, applying to th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> square or opposition of an Infortune in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, the same.</p>
<p class="Q2">11. The Lord of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, in the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, or in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, argues the Beasts strayed to be either in the Pound, or under the Command of some Officer.</p>
<p class="Q2">12. The Lord of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, or 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, fortunated by the good Beams of Jupiter or Venus in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Houses, or the Sun casting a trine unto them there, they are very likely to be found again. (Gadbury 1658, 279–280)</p>
<p class="Ahead">Of Things Lost, If Recoverable or Not?</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa ParaOverride-7">1. Fortunate Planets in sextile or trine to the Lords of the Ascendant or 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> House, and the <span class="ital">Dispositor of the Part of Fortune</span> posited in the Ascendant or 2<span class="CharOverride-6">n</span><span class="CharOverride-15">d</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">H</span>ouse, declares recovery of the goods lost.</p>
<p class="Q2">2. Either of the fortunes [Venus or Jupiter] in the Ascendant, having Dignities in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd </span>House, or the Moon in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, in sextile or trine to the Lord of the Ascendant: both these are very certain Arguments of a recovery of the Thing or Things lost.</p>
<p class="Q2">3. The Moon in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, in trine to a Planet in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, or in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> trine to the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> or the <span class="ital">Dispositor of the part of Fortune</span>, the Lord of the Ascendant in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> House; the lights in trine to each other or in trine to the Cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> House, or the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> in the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Houses; all these are arguments of recovery.</p>
<p class="Q2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page87" title="87"></span>4. The Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in the Ascendant, or with the Lord of the Ascendant, denotes a recovery of the Goods lost: Jupiter, Venus or North Node in the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House, give great hopes of the same also, and this I have often proved true.</p>
<p class="Q2">5. The Moon, part of Fortune or his Dispositors, or Lord of the 2nd in the 8th House, is a great argument that the Goods lost cannot be recovered.</p>
<p class="Q2">6. When both Luminaries are under the Earth, the Thing lost is hard to be recovered: If the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> House or his Lord be any way hindered, it denotes the same.</p>
<p class="Q2">7. But the greatest argument of an irrecovery, are the position of Saturn, Mars or South Node out of their essential Dignities in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> House; or the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> being either in Combustion, or in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> House; or if the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in square or opposition with the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>.</p>
<p class="Q2">8. Mr. Lilly said If the Lord of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> shall be in conjunction with the Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>; or if the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> behold not the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> House, or Lord thereof; or the Sun and Moon are not aspecting each other or the Part of Fortune; or when they are both under the Earth; there can be no restitution of the goods lost. (Gadbur<span class="CharOverride-4">y</span> 1658, 280–281)</p>
<p class="Ahead">In What Time Shall the Thing [Lost or] Stolen Be Recovered?</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa ParaOverride-7">1. Seeing testimonies of recovery in your Figure, you may also discover the time thus: Observe the application of the two Planets signifying recovery, and consider <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he Degrees of distance between their body or Aspect, and so turn the distance into <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ime.</p>
<p class="Q2">2. If they happen to be in moveable [cardinal] signs, then give so many weeks or days as you have Degrees of distance, for the space, or time in which it may be recovered. If in common [mutable] signs, give months or weeks: If fixed signs, Years or Months.</p>
<p class="Q2">3. When the Sun and Moon together behold the Ascendant, the Thing lost shall suddenly be recovered; for they suffer nothing to lie long hid, or obscured: And if at the same time, the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in the Ascendant, it will be had again very speedily.</p>
<p class="Q2">4. The Significators increasing in light and motion, and posited in fortunate places of the Figure, presage a sudden recovery of the Goods lost or missing. (Gadbury 1658, 282–283)</p>
