<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-13">GADBURY: CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE JUDGMENT (1658)</p>
<p class="txni">The British astrologer John Gadbury (1627–1704) was initially an ardent follower of William Lilly, but later in life the two became bitter enemies. Gadbury published his own extensive textbook on nativities and horary astrology. The following eight criteria for determining when a chart can be considered “radical,” or fit to judge, are quoted from Gadbury’s <span class="ital">Doctrine of Horary Questions, Astrologically Handled</span> (1658).</p>
<p class="Q1"><span class="med">When a Figure is Radical, and fit to be judged.</span></p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">The Astrologer before he adventures to judge a Question, ought first to consider, whether it be proper and fit to be judged: For many times, Persons propounds impertinent Questions, with an intention to disgrace Art; in doing which, they do nothing but create shame to themselves. Then, the Artist shall sometimes meet with Persons that know not how to propound their desires aright, it’s an Argumen<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>hen such Queries are made, that (although they may be asked with a good intent, yet) they are not ripe for a resolve; and the Astrologer in such Cases ought to defer judgement until another time.</p>
<p class="Q2">Now, for the discovery of the knavery of the one, and the unfitness or unpreparedness of the other, you may observe these following Rules and Aphorisms—viz.</p>
<p class="Q4 ParaOverride-7">1. When the Sign Ascending, and Planet in the Ascendant, &amp;c. shall describe the person of the Querent exactly, you may conclude that figure Radical, and the Question propounded fit to be judged. (Gadbury 1658, 237–238)</p>
<p class="tx">Note: Gadbury is emphasizing the commonsense idea that a radical chart must accurately describe the querent and, by implication, symbolically depict the situation surrounding the question. Even if there is no agreement between the rulers of the Ascendant and the hour, a chart that accurately describes the circumstances of the horary question should b<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page84" title="84"></span>considered radical. Furthermore, in locating lost objects, there are often several potential significators for the missing object (e.g., the rulers of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> and 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> houses, the Part of Fortune and its dispositor, the Moon, and the natural planetary signifier of the missing item). Usually the significator that best describes the object is the key to determining its location.</p>
<p class="Q1 ParaOverride-7">2. When either the very beginning of a Sign ascends, or the very later end thereof, it is not safe to give judgement; for the Querent hath been tampering with others about the business propounded, or else the Question is forged, and therefore not fit to be answered.</p>
<p class="Q2">3. When the Moon void of Course, or in Via Combusta, the Combust way; All Matters or businesses propounded, go unluckily on: therefore the Astrologer ought to understand the Matter propounded perfectly, or else he will give but poor con<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ent to the Querent therein.</p>
<p class="Q2">4. If the Moon goes to a square or opposition of the Lord of the 7th; or the Lord of the Ascendant afflict him so; the Artist may conclude his Querent a knave, for he then comes to abuse him.</p>
<p class="Q2">5. If the 7th House be hindered, or his Lord be Retrograde, Combust, or otherways afflicted, let not the Astrologer judge any thing: for by how much the more he shall adventure to judge at such a time, by so much the more shall he disgrac<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">h</span>imself, and disparage the Art he professeth. And that’s the meaning of Ptolemy’s words <span class="ital">Quantis in erroribus versatur Astrologin cum locus septimus ac ejus Dominus afflicti erunt</span>. Centilog. Aphor. 14.</p>
<p class="Q2">6. When Saturn is Ascendant of a Question, and infortunate, the Matter propounded is either false and without ground, or else tis past all hope: And if at the same, the Lord of the Ascendant be Combust or Retrograde, the Querent is either a knave or a fool.</p>
<p class="Q2">7. When the testimonies in your Figure are equal, the Matter propounded ought not to be judged; for the Artist knows not which way the balance may yield, wherefore he ought to defer judgment, until a more convenient time.</p>
<p class="Q2">8. Some Astrologers hold the Question to be Radical, when the Lord of the Ascendant, and Lord of the hour, are of one nature and Triplicity; which is easily known: suppose Leo ascends the Horoscope at the Querent’s Interrogation, and Mars happens to be Lord of the hour; here the Question will be found Radical, because the Sun who is Lord of the Horoscope, and Mars, are of one nature, viz. Hot and Dry; Or if at the same time, Jupiter fortune to be Lord of the hour, the Question will then be admitted Radical because it is of the same Triplicity with th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Sun. Understand the same of the rest. (Gadbury 1658, 237–238)</p>
