<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-39">LILLY: A HORSE LOST OR <br/>STOLEN NEAR HENLEY</p>
<p class="txni">Money is not the only thing to commonly be stolen or go missing. In Lilly’s day, the theft of one’s horse presented a major crisis that might prompt a querent to seek the aid of a horary astrologer. In this chapter, we review one of Lilly’s horary examples from <span class="ital">Christian Astrology </span>regarding a missing horse.</p>
<p class="Q4">Mercury Here Lord of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> signifies the Horse whom you see Retrograde, &amp; hastening to a Conjunction of the Sun, Lord of the Querent’s House of Substance; forasmuch as Mercury did by his Retrograde motion apply to the Lord of the Querent’s house of Substance, and that the Moon was locally in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> and both Jupiter and Mars Retrograde, near the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, I judged the Querent should have his Goods or Horse quickly and unexpectedly, within a day to two from the tim<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> of the Question asked; and because the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house was afflicted by South Node, I judged the Thief could not keep him. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 467)</span></p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"></a>Chart 38: Lilly: Horse Lost or Stolen? <br/>21 January 1647, 3:09 p.m. LMT, London. Moon day, Mars hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 1<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 24' Leo.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page271" title="271"></span>In <a href="HA-34.html">Chart 38</a>, Gemini is on the cusp of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of large animals, making Mercury the ruler of the missing horse. Mercury is retrograde and moving quickly toward the Sun, which rules the querent’s 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of movable resources. Lilly refers to the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">n</span><span class="CharOverride-15">d</span> as the “<span class="ital">house of substance</span>.” Lilly also notes that Jupiter and Mars are both retrograde an<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> conjunct at the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, suggesting a return of his possessions. The Moon, a natural ruler of fugitives and runaways and also the Ascendant ruler (the querent), occupies the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, suggesting that the missing horse will again take its place among the querent’s possessions.</p>
<p class="Q1">I was asked, Which way he went? I considered the Sign of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> was Gemini, viz. West; the Sign wherein Mercury Lord of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> was in, was Aquarius, viz. West; though the quarter of Heaven was South, but much inclining to the West; and the Moon was in Leo, a North-east Signe: Besides, Mercury as he was Lord of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, was in a West Signe. From whence I concluded, the Horse was gone Westward; but because Mercury was Retrograde, I judged the Horse would not proceed far, <span class="CharOverride-4">b</span>ut return again to his proper owner [and indeed the Horse did come home three days after, and had been full west]; however, I judged the Horse would have been at home a day sooner; but who shall more exactly consider of the Scheme, shall find, the Mercury Significator of the Horse, although he came to the body of Sun Lord of the Querent’s house of Substance, the same night the Question was asked, yet because the Sun had no Dignities where he was, the Horse came not home until Wednesday or Thursday the 13<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or 14<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> of January [OS], at what time Mercury and Venus came to a partill Conjunction. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 467– 468)</span></p>
<p class="Q2">I must confess, here were many good significations that the Querent should recover his lost Horse: first, North Node in the ascendant: next, Moon in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, arguing he should be discovered: thirdly, Mercury Lord of the thing lost Retrograde, importing a returning of the thing again casually: fourthly, two Retrograde Planets upon the cusp of the 2nd, which usually shows quick and unexpected recovery; Jupiter and Mars peregrine, I took them for those that rode away the Horse, Jupiter especially [and it was very true]. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 468)</span></p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page272" title="272"></span>Lilly: Further Comments on Lost Goods</p>
<p class="txni">Earlier in <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span>, Lilly presents several rules about judging such cases.</p>
<p class="Bhead-indents">How the Things or Goods Were Lost</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">If you will know how in what manner they were lost, behold from whom the Lord of the Ascendant did last separate, and if he did separate from Saturn, the cause of the lost thing was through forgetfulness of the owner, who knows not where he laid it, or it is forgotten by reason of some cold or sickness which afflicted the loser, especially if Saturn be Retrograde. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 321)</span></p>
<p class="tx">In the case of the missing horse near Henley (chart 38), the Moon has just separated from a square to Saturn, suggesting that the loss was due to the forgetfulness of the owner, who may have been ill at the time of the loss.</p>
<p class="Q1">If he be separated from Jupiter, or in the house of Jupiter, then through fast or abstinence, or ordering of Laws, or by his excess of care of governing of things, o<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> managing the affaires of the house, or else by some trust put upon him that carried it away or mislaid it. [This was Friarly Astrology and supposes somewhat lost in an Abbey or Nunnery.] </p>
<p class="Q2">If he be separated from Mars, or in the house of Mars, it was lost through fear, or by some hidden passion, provoking the loser to anger, fury, fire, or for enmity, or upon a quarrel. If from the Sun or his house, then by the means of the King, study of hunting or pastime, or by means of the master of the Family, or a Gentleman. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 321)</span></p>
<p class="Q2">If from Venus or in her house, then by drinking, Cards or Dice, or making merry in an Alehouse or Tavern, or by pastime, or singing and dallying with women, &amp;c. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 321)</span></p>
<p class="Q2">If from Mercury by reason of writing, or sending, or dictating of Letters, or going on a Message. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 321)</span></p>
<p class="Q2">If from the Moon, or in the house of the Moon, it was lost by too frequent use, and shewing the Commodity of thing lost, or the party made it too common, or some Messenger, Widow or Servant lost the same. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 321)</span></p>
<p class="Q2">If the thing lost or missing be a Beast, and not a thing movable, the signification in knowing the place, and the state thereof, is as the said significations of things not having life, but that it is needful to seek whether it fled away of itself, or some other drove him away, whether it lives or no? and to find the cause of the death of it, if it be dead. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 321)</span></p>
<p class="Bhead-indents"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page273" title="273"></span>Whether It Be Stolen or No</p>
<p class="tx">[This rule concerns Cattle.] </p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">If you would know if the Beast fled away by itself, or somebody took it, behold if you find the Lord of the house of the Moon separating himself from any Planet, say then, that he fled away of his own accord; but if the lord of the house of the Moon be not separated from any Planet, but that another Planet is separating himself from him, say that someone or other took it and fled away; but if the lord of the house of the Moon be not in any of these two we speak of, behold what you see by the positure of the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, and judge by him as you judge by the Lord of the house of the Moon, and her separation; and if you find of these <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>wo no separation, say that the Beast is still in his place, or near it, and that he fled not away. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 321–322)</span></p>
<p class="tx">In the case of the missing horse near Henley, the Moon lies in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, which is ruled by Leo. The Sun, which rules Leo, lies at 1<span class="CharOverride-6"> o</span> 35' Aquarius and is not separating from any planet. On the other hand, the Moon at 12<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 03' Leo has recently opposed the Sun and is now separating from the opposition aspect, so that we can say of the missing horse that “<span class="ital">someone or other took it and fled away</span>.”</p>
