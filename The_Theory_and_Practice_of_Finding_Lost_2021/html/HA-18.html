<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-23">THE SIGNS</p>
<p class="txni">Finding lost objects with horary involves describing the location where they are likely to have been misplaced or to be currently located. This chapter presents quotations from Lilly on this topic, followed by my own elaborations of Lilly’s ideas.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Locations and the Elementary Nature of the Signs</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly writes:<span class="ital"> </span></p>
<p class="Q4">The nature of the Signs showed me also the quality of the place in the house, viz. </p>
<p class="list2">• Airy Signs, above ground; </p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Fiery Signs, near a Wall or Partition; </p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Earthly Signs, on the Floor; </p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> Watery Signs, near a moist place in the room, &amp;c. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 204)</p>
<p class="Ahead">Air Signs (Yang)</p>
<p class="txni">Above ground, in upper rooms, an attic, an open space, on an upper floor of the house, high up from the floor or ground, on a shelf, at or near the top of a tall piece of furniture; near a window, windowsill, or where air can flow; hanging in the air, like laundry on a clothesline (we generally avoid airing our dirty laundry in public). Both Fire and Air signs indicate locations higher up in a room; and, like Fire signs, the Air signs can also signify that an item is hanging from a hook or fastener, or possibly from a doorknob. Air circulates as wind above the earth.</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page142" title="142"></span>Fire Signs (Yang)</p>
<p class="txni">Near a wall or partition, perhaps hanging from a hook or fastener on the wall, or possibly from a doorknob; near a chimney, stove, radiator, or other heat source; near a light or lamp, at mid-height or waist level (heat rises); with tools or near objects made of iron o<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> steel (ruled by fiery Mars), in a place related to combustion or the use of heat or fire, in a garage or in a car. In one case in my files, the significator in a Fire sign reflected the fact that the querent left the missing item in a garden shed (with rakes and shovels made of iron). Heat rises, and Fire signs generally refer to places aboveground. In another case, the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> and 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house significators (the missing possession and its location, respectively) wer<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> both in Fire signs, and the missing keys were found in a purse hanging from a doorknob <span class="CharOverride-4">b</span>etween two rooms.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Earth Signs (Yin)</p>
<p class="txni">Earth signs suggest locations on the floor, near or at ground level, in the ground, beneath the floor or pavement, in a basement, etc. Because earth forms the ground that we walk on, Earth signs can sometimes signify places or things that are dusty, dirty, dark, solid, “soiled,” well trodden, or made of earth or clay. Outdoors, the Earth signs can refer to parks and gardens, or to locations that are muddy or near a bridge. Things in the earth are often covered, hidden, concealed, or contained within an enclosed space.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Water Signs (Yin)</p>
<p class="txni">Near a moist or damp place, near water, water fixtures, or liquids of any kind; “in the buttery, dairy, or wash house” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 203); in a comfortable location. Water descends to th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">b</span>ottom of its container, and Water signs often refer to places that are low down, on th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> floor, at or beneath ground level, or below a main room. If contained within something, the item may be in the lower portion or below a main compartment of the container, as in the bottom of a bag or pocketbook, in a lower drawer, on a lower shelf, etc. Water i<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> a feminine yin element, and a useful mnemonic for remembering locations indicated by Water signs might be an image of a mother carrying an unborn child in amniotic fluid in her womb.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Signs: Leading with Their Forehead or Their Back Side</p>
<p class="txni">Indian astrology takes note of whether the constellation of stars associated with each sign rises with its head or its back. The <span class="ital">Shirshodaya</span> constellations depicting the Twins, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page143" title="143"></span>Lion, the Virgin, the Scales, the Scorpion, and the Water-Bearer rise headfirst over the eastern horizon, followed by the rest of their bodies. This straightforward approach to rising is considered auspicious and helps horary matters to proceed smoothly and directly. </p>
<p class="tx">On the other hand, the <span class="ital">Prishtodaya</span> star groups depicting the Ram, the Bull, the Crab, the Man-Horse Archer, and the Sea-Goat (Crocodile) are said to rise with their rear parts as they traverse the eastern horizon. This “backward” approach to rising is considered somewhat inauspicious and may indicate impediments, delays, or carelessness related to the question and its resolution. Only the two Fishes, swimming in opposite directions, rise sideways (neither headfirst nor rear first), indicating a mixed influence. </p>
<p class="tx">I have not tested this concept extensively, but it may provide clues to finding lost objects or explaining how they were misplaced. For example, if the significator of a missing object falls in a sign whose hindquarters are first to rise, then the item might be found by retracing one’s steps (going back), or it may quite literally be found in a place associated with the rear of people or things, such as a rear pocket, a <span class="ital">back</span>pack, a jacket worn on one’s back, th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> back seat of a car, or the cushions of a couch that one sits on. In addition, the querent may have misplaced the item by not having followed their usual, standard, or expected manner of storing it. In one case in my files, Sagittarius rises rear-end first, and the querent, in a rush, had placed some important papers out of view on top of a tall cabinet with the <span class="CharOverride-4">i</span>ntention of later filing them where he normally keeps his documents. He then forgot that he had put the papers high up and out of view, but fortunately the horary chart enabled <span class="CharOverride-4">h</span>im to locate the missing item.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Aries, the Ram</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Where Sheep and small Cattle do feed or use to be, sandy and hilly Grounds, a place of refuge for Thieves, (as some unfrequented place); in Houses, the Covering, Ceiling or Plastering of it; a Stable of small Beasts, Lands newly taken in, or newly plowed, or where Bricks have been burned or Lime. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 93)</p>
<p class="tx">Indoors: near the roof or ceiling, near plastering, a hot room or location, near heat or fire; near a stove, radiator, or furnace; an exercise room; at waist level, at mid-height in a room, near iron (ruled by Mars), near a wall or partition; near things related to the human head; easterly. As a cardinal sign, Aries can indicate a location that is high up, such as a chamber (enclosed space) above another, a top shelf, or the upper part of a house or a room. Cardinal signs can also suggest a location that experiences energetic or rapid movement, activity, and change. Aries colors are blood red, fiery colors, and white mixed with red.</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page144" title="144"></span>Taurus, the Bull</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Stables where Horses are, low Houses, Houses where the implements of Cattle are laid up, Pastures or Feeding grounds where no Houses are fleer, plain grounds, or where Bushes have been lately grub’d up, and Wherein Wheat and Corn is sowed, some little Tree not far off; in Houses, Cellars, low Rooms. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 94)</p>
<p class="tx">Indoors: basements, cellars, “stables where horses are” (the modern equivalent might be the garage for one’s car), sheds or small buildings near the main dwelling, storerooms, closets, the ground floor, low rooms, the lower parts of a house or container; near things related to the neck and throat, near items used for gardening or cultivating crops; low down, close to or on the ground, on or under the floor, beneath a chair or piece of furniture; near stones, cement, or objects made of clay or earth; southerly or southeasterly. As a fixed sign, Taurus may indicate that the missing object “wants to stay put” and will thus be hard to find. The Earth signs generally refer to places that are lower in a room or a dwelling, in the lower part of wherever they are stored, or near to the ground. Taurus can also suggest an outdoor location, such as a park or garden (or near things used outdoors, such as bicycles, backpacks, or sporting equipment). Taurus colors are a red and citron mixture, <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>nd white mixed with lemon.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Gemini, the Fraternal Twins</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Wainscot Rooms, Plastering, and Walls of Houses, the Halls, or where Play is used, Hills and Mountains, Barns, Storehouses for Corn, Coffers, Chests, High Places. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 94) </p>
<p class="tx">Indoors: above waist level, near a wall or somehow attached to a wall, in a hallway; where games or music are played, in a chest, with books and papers, in a file cabinet, in or near a desk or bookcase, near a computer or keyboard, in a drawer, in a study, near communication devices, in a vehicle; near things related to the lungs, shoulders, arms, and hands; upper rooms or the upper part of a room, on a shelf, hanging from a hook or bracket; near a window or a place with a view, on a windowsill; in a location that allows o<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> needs air to circulate; westerly or west by south. </p>
<p class="tx">As an intermediary mutable sign marking the transition between two seasons, Gemini can indicate a location that is like a “second home” or that represents being “in two places at once,” such as a chamber within another (an enclosed space within a larger space), a closet within a room, a chest of drawers, a pocket within a purse or item of clothing, a box <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page145" title="145"></span>within a vault or closet, a drawer within a dresser, etc. Gemini, ruled by Mercury, the messenger of the gods, is also related to transportation and can signify pathways, staircases, <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>uitcases, or other items used for travel. Gemini colors are a red and white mixture.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Cancer, the Crab</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">The Sea, great Rivers, Navigable Waters; but in the Inland Countries it notes places near Rivers, Brooks, Springs, Wells, Cellars in Houses, Wash-houses, Marsh grounds, Ditches with Rushes, Sedges, Sea banks, Trenches, Cisterns. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 95)</p>
<p class="tx">Indoors: kitchens, washrooms, laundry rooms, cellars; near sinks, drains, or plumbing; where water is used; near things related to the breasts, chest, or stomach; below waist level, in the lower part of a room, northerly. The Crab, as a mobile creature with a homey interior and a protective shell, can symbolize automobiles, chariots, and portable rooms or spaces. Cancerians are said to enjoy using their “claws” to collect things, which they may put in a pocket or store in a small container. Cancer, as a Water sign, usually indicates locations that are down low. As a cardinal sign, Cancer can also suggest a location that experience<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> a lot of energetic or rapid movement, activity, and change. Cancer colors are green or russet.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Leo, the Lion</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">A place where wild Beasts frequent, Woods, Forests, Desert places, steep rocky places, inaccessible places, Kings Palaces, Castles, Forts, Parks, in houses where fire is kept, near a Chimney. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 95)</p>
<p class="tx">Indoors: the main room, playroom, sunroom, den, the cat’s or pet’s area; places connected with parks or public gardens, recreation, sports, camping, and the outdoors; a room with plants; an outdoor view or a room related to plants, gardening, and the outdoors; near a source of light or heat, near a radiator or chimney, in a sunny location, near a wall or partition, on a windowsill; near things related to the heart or back; at waist level, at mid-height in a room; easterly or east by north. </p>
<p class="tx">As a fixed sign, Leo may indicate that the missing object “wants to stay put” and will thus be hard to find. The fixed sign Leo can refer to a park or garden, or a location near to <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hings that are used outdoors, such as bicycles, gardening, or sporting equipment. Leo is associated with the human heart, so the missing item may be in a place where you would normally keep the things dearest to you. Leo colors are golden, orange, red, and green.</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page146" title="146"></span>Virgo, the Maiden</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">It signifies a Study where Books are, a closet, a Dairy-house, Corn-fields, Granaries, Malt-houses, Hay-ricks, or of Barley, Wheat or Peas, or a place where Cheese and Butter is preserved and stored up. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 96)</p>
<p class="tx">Indoors: in a study or a place used for paperwork; inside something such as a cabinet, cupboard, drawer, box, bag, envelope, case, or compartment; neatly stored for safekeeping (Virgo can be anal-retentive), where “cheese and butter” are stored (Lilly), in a closet, with books or on a bookshelf, in a file cabinet; near things related to the abdomen, intestines, and digestive system; low down, close to the ground, on or under the floor, on the ground floor, in the lower part of wherever they are stored; near stones, cement, or objects made of earth; southerly or south by west. As an intermediary mutable “dual” sign marking th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> transition between two seasons, Virgo can indicate a location that is like a “second home” or that represents being “in two places at once,” such as a chamber within another (an enclosed space within a larger space), a closet within a room, in a pocket within a purse or item of clothing, a box within a vault or closet, a drawer within a dresser, a boxlik<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> structure, a compartment within a suitcase, etc. Virgo colors are black and blue splotches, <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>peckled, and dark colors.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Libra, the Scales</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">In the Fields it represents ground near Wind-mills, or some straggling Barn or outhouse, or Saw-pits, or where Coopers work or Wood is cut, sides of hills, tops <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>f Mountains, grounds where Hawking and Hunting is used, sandy and gravelly Fields, pure clean Air and sharp, the upper rooms in Houses, Chambers, Garrets, one Chamber within another. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 96)</p>
<p class="tx">Indoors: upstairs, high up, on a shelf, on top of a table or cabinet, where things can be hung, in a top drawer, on top of something, in upper rooms, in an attic, inside a chamber within a chamber, where clothing is kept, above waist level, in the upper part of a room; near a window or place with a view; near beautiful furniture or adornments; near things related to the kidneys and lumbar region; in places where balances or scales are used or displayed; westerly. As a cardinal sign, Libra can indicate a location that is high up, such as a chamber (an enclosed space) above or within another, or the upper part of a house or a room. Cardinal signs can also suggest a location that may experience a lot of energetic or <span class="CharOverride-4">r</span>apid movement, activity, and change. Because of the location of the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> in late <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page147" title="147"></span>Libra, a significator in the <span class="ital">second half of Libra</span> can indicate a location near combustion, such as in a vehicle with a combustion engine. Libra colors are dark crimson, tawny, black<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> and pastel shades.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Scorpio, the Scorpion</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Places where all sorts of creeping Beasts use, as Beetles, &amp;c. or such as be without wings, and are poisonous; Gardens, Orchards, Vineyards, Ruinous Houses near Waters; muddy, moorish Grounds, stinking Lakes, Quagmires, Sinks, the Kitchen or Larder, Wash-house. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 97)</p>
<p class="tx">Indoors: low down in a room, on the floor; in damp, dark, deep, or dirty places (frequented by “all sorts of creeping Beasts”); where water is used, near plumbing or liquids, in a kitchen, near a sink or toilet, in a bathroom, where junk or waste is kept, underwater, in the garbage, below waist level, near things related to the sex organs, under a seat (or near where the querent was sitting when the object went missing), on or under the floor, at the lower part or bottom of a location, places where all sorts of creeping bugs and animals may crawl; near things related to the genitals (privy parts), anus, and organs of elimination; places involving a well-kept secret; locations related to medicine or surgery; northerly or northeasterly.</p>
<p class="tx">Scorpio is known for its deep level of secrecy, so the missing item could be in a dark, well-hidden, hard-to-penetrate, or carefully guarded place; a location where you put things so that others don’t have access, such as a safety deposit box, wallet, trunk, or bank vault. Because of the location of the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> in early Scorpio, a significator in the <span class="ital">first half of Scorpio</span> can indicate a location near combustion, such as in an automobile with its combustion engine, or an area that is obscured or devoid of illumination. Scorpio colors are dark brown, maroon, and dark green. Modern astrologers link the 8th house, Scorpio, and Pluto with death and elimination and with ideas of transformation and rebirth; thus, the missing object could be in a place undergoing demolition and renovation or could hav<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> been accidentally discarded or placed in the trash.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Sagittarius, the Man-Horse</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">A Stable of great Horses, or Horses for the Wars, or a House where usually great four-footed Beasts are kept; it represents in the Fields, Hills, and the highest places of Lands or Grounds that rise a little above the rest; in houses, upper rooms, near the fire.

<p class="tx">As an intermediary mutable sign marking the transition between two seasons, Sagittarius can indicate a location that is like a “second home” or that represents being “in two places at once,” such as a chamber within another (an enclosed space within a larger space), a closet within a room, in a pocket within a purse or item of clothing, a compartment within a backpack, a box within a vault or closet, a drawer within a dresser, a boxlike structure, etc. Sagittarius colors are yellow, orange-yellow, and green-sanguine (golden green).</p>
<p class="Ahead">Capricorn, the Sea-Goat or Crocodile</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">It shews an Ox-house, or Cow-house, or where Calves are kept, or Tools for Husbandry, or old Wood is laid up; or where Sails for Ships and such Materials are stored; also Sheep-Pens, and grounds where Sheep feed, Fallow-grounds, barren Fields Bushy and Thorny; Dunghills in Fields, or where Soil is laid; in houses, low dark places, near the ground or threshold.

As a cardinal sign, Capricorn can suggest a location that may experience a lot of energetic or rapid movement, activity, and change. Capricorn’s colors are dark brown, russet, swarthy brown, and black.</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page149" title="149"></span>Aquarius, the Man Who Carries Water</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Hilly and uneven places, places newly dug, or where quarries of Stone are, or any Minerals have been dug up; in Houses, the roofs, eaves or upper parts; Vineyards, or near some little Spring or Conduit-head.<span class="ital"> </span>(<span class="ital">CA</span> 99)</p>

<p class="Ahead">Where Is My Silk Scarf?</p>
<p class="txni">My wife is forever misplacing things. On the evening of 15 December 2017, we had dinner at a Japanese restaurant with some friends. When we arrived home, my wife noticed that the silk scarf she had on at the restaurant was missing. At 8:30 p.m. EST, she asked me to help her find the scarf. I quickly cast a horary chart (chart 17).</p>
<p class="caption-center"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page150" title="150"></span></p>
<div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">
<div class="chart-nsa" id="_idContainer205">

</div>
</div>
<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"></a>Chart 17: Where Is My Silk Scarf? <br/>15 December 2017, 8:30 p.m. EST, 41N17, 73W02. Venus day, Mercury hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 16<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 48' Aquarius.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page151" title="151"></span>It is a Venus day during a Mercury hour. The Ascendant-ruler Sun and the lords of the day and hour (Venus and Mercury) are all conjunct in Sagittarius in the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. Th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> chart appears radical.</p>
<p class="tx">My wife is shown by the Leo Ascendant. Her ruler is the Sun, and her co-ruler is the Moon.</p>
<p class="tx">The missing scarf is signified by Mercury, ruler of the Virgo 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of movable goods. Mercury is retrograde, suggesting that the scarf will return to her. The Moon can also signify missing items, as can the dispositor of the Part of Fortune, which is also Mercury in this chart. Venus is a natural signifier of women’s clothing.</p>
<p class="tx">All the signifiers of the scarf lie in Sagittarius, the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Whole Sign house; and all but the Moon lie in the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Regiomontanus house. Because the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house signifies fun, good times with friends, enjoyable meals, and restaurants, I suggested that she call the restaurant.</p>
<p class="tx">In addition, the location of missing items is often revealed by studying the ruler of the 4th house (where treasure is hidden), which in this chart is Mars in Scorpio. Mars conjoins the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp (the subterranean house), and Scorpio (a Water sign) implies a location <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hat is lower down and may be dark or dirty (which suggested to me that the scarf may be on the floor beneath the table at the restaurant).</p>
<p class="tx">Mars is just leaving the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house (local travel, communications, phone calls) and entering the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (the querent’s home, the location of buried treasure), suggesting that a phone call might bring her scarf home. Mars at the cusp of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> is an indication that the item may have fallen down and be behind or beneath something that obscures its view. Recall Lilly’s comment about significators at boundaries:</p>
<p class="Q4">If your Significator be going out of one Sign and entering another, the thing is behind something or other, or is carelessly fallen down betwixt two rooms, or near the Threshold, or joining together of two rooms, and is higher or lower in the place, according to the nature of the Sign, &amp;c. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 203)</p>
<p class="tx">I told my wife that her scarf was probably on the floor under the table where we ate at the restaurant.</p>
<p class="tx">Within five minutes of her asking the question, she called the restaurant and they found her scarf on the floor under the table and against the wall where she had eaten, just as the chart indicated. Fire signs indicate a location near a wall or partition. Apparently the signifi<span class="CharOverride-4">c</span>ator of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp (Mercury) in Sagittarius meant that the scarf was against a wall, and the significator of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (Mars) in Scorpio indicated that it was on the floor.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page152" title="152"></span>Her rapid recovery of the scarf was probably shown by Mercury retrograde applying to a trine to the Ascendant in less than one degree. In addition, the Moon’s North Node conjunct the Ascendant and the Part of Fortune conjunct the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp are indications of prompt recovery.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Retrograde Significators and the Void-of-Course Moon</p>
<p class="txni">In the previous example of my wife’s missing scarf, the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler (Mercury) is retrograde, that is, in apparent backward motion in the sky, so that it is moving backward toward its point of departure. When the significator of a missing item is retrograde, the item will usually be found, unless there are strong indications to the contrary in the chart.</p>
<p class="tx">In missing object horaries, the void-of-course Moon often indicates that the item will be found. To the best of my recollection, it was one of my horary teachers, Joan McEvers, who provided me with the reasoning for this interpretation. The Moon is a general signifier of fugitives and things that wander, that is, lost or missing possessions. When the Moon is void of course, it is unable to connect with the other planets in the chart. Thus, the void Moon (a symbol of things that have gone astray) can’t do a good job of staying lost and the item is more easily found. Owing to its void state, the Moon’s desire to wander and remain missing is rendered futile and ineffective.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Kevin’s Keys</p>
<p class="txni">The following horary illustrates the above principles. Kevin kindly gave me permission to discuss his horary question, which he posted on 12 November 2019 in the Facebook Horary Astrology Group. Kevin “lost” his car keys sometime between Sunday, 10 November 2019, and Tuesday, 12 November 2019, and he asked the horary question “Where are the car keys?” on 12 November 2019 at 16:15:44 p.m. EST in Boca Raton, Florida (<a href="HA-18.html">Chart 18</a>). Instead of using Lilly’s preferred Regiomontanus houses, Kevin cast the chart with <span class="ital">Campanus</span> houses, which produce similar house cusps. Placidus houses would have placed different signs on some of the cusps. When analyzing another astrologer’s horary chart, I stick to the house system originally used, in this case Campanus houses.</p>
<p class="tx">The question was asked on a Mars day (Tuesday) during a Mercury hour. Because the lord of the hour, Mercury, is not of the same triplicity or nature as the lord of the Ascendant, Mars, Lilly would advise proceeding with caution because the question may not be “radical,” or “fit to be judged.” On the other hand, Mercury is a natural signifier of keys, and it is symbolically appropriate that Mercury rules the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of movable possessions in the house system chosen by this querent. In addition, Mars rules iron and is symbolically connected to mechanics and combustion engines. Thus, the chart appears to be rad<span class="CharOverride-4">ic</span>al and fit to be judged because it adequately describes the situation.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"></a>Chart 18: Kevin: Where Are the Car Keys? <br/>12 November 2019, 16:15:44 p.m. EST, Boca Raton, FL. Mars day, Mercury hour. <br/>Campanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 5<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 36' Pisces. Late degree rising.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page154" title="154"></span>Kevin goes on to tell us that on Sunday, he went with his family to a Buddhist center and then to the beach and finally to visit some friends, who later informed him that he did not leave the keys at their house. On Monday, he didn’t go anywhere. Looking at the chart, we see that Aries rises, making Mars the planet that signifies Kevin. Mars has just completed a sextile to Jupiter in Sagittarius, and Jupiter rules the Sagittarius 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (religious sites and expansive outdoor locations) and the Pisces 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (retreat centers and the ocean). Again, the symbolism fits the events. </p>
<p class="tx">With Gemini on the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> Campanus cusp, Mercury rules the keys. Mercury is also a natural signifier of keys. Had Kevin used Placidus or a Whole Sign house system, Taurus would have been on the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp and we would take Venus to rule the keys. Nonetheless, Kevin chose to use the Campanus system, and because horary is a divinatory sys<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>em, the universe prompted him to ask the question at the appropriate moment to provide an answer. As Morinus pointed out in book 18 of his <span class="ital">Astrologia Gallica</span>, it is useful to consider the Whole Sign places in addition to the quadrant houses when delineating charts.</p>
<p class="tx">What planet(s) signify the missing keys in this chart? First and most important, Mercury rules the keys because of Gemini on the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> Campanus cusp and also because Me<span class="CharOverride-4">rc</span>ur<span class="CharOverride-4">y</span> is a natural signifier of keys. Second, the Moon co-rules the missing keys because the Moon is a signifier of things that stray or wander. Third, the Part of Fortune and its dispositor can be a symbol for material goods. Lastly, Venus has a signification of personal possessions as ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> Whole Sign from the Ascendant.</p>
<p class="tx">Note that Mercury is retrograde, meaning that it is in apparent backward motion in the heavens and is headed back toward its point of departure, which was with the querent. The retrograde status of the planet signifying a missing object often means that the item will return. In addition, the Moon is void of course, meaning that it will not be within orb of aspecting any planet before leaving its sign. Some of the older texts call this state “being in an aspect vacuum.” The Moon is kind of floating in space, unable to connect to any other visible planet and just waiting for the querent to come and find her. She is unable to wander away or get lost successfully because of her void-of-course status. Both of these testimonies suggest that the missing keys will come back to Kevin.</p>
<p class="tx">Where are the keys? The primary significator, Mercury, is in Scorpio in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, which is an angular house. Angular houses refer to a place nearby and often frequented by the querent, such as the querent’s home, car, or office. Specifically, however, the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house refers to one’s spouse or partner, so the keys are likely to be with his spouse or in a location that she frequents. Kevin’s wife is triply emphasized in this horary because 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> ruler Mercury <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page155" title="155"></span>lies in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, as does the Part of Fortune. In addition, the dispositor of the Part of Fortune in Scorpio is Mars, which closely conjoins the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp. This triple emphasis strongly suggests that the keys are with his wife or in a place that she frequents. If we allow Venus, as ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> Whole Sign, to signify the keys, then Venus in Sagittarius lies in the second quadrant house of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house wife, which is also the third Whole Sign house of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house partner. Thus, the missing keys could be with the wife’s possessions (8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house as 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> of 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) or with something connected with her short-distance travels (9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house as 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> of 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>).</p>
<p class="tx">Why haven’t the keys been found yet? The main signifier of the keys, Mercury, is combust the Sun. Combustion means that the brightness of the Sun overpowers the visibility of the object, rendering it difficult, if not impossible, to see. Thus, the keys are hidden or <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>bscured by something. Kevin and his wife can’t see them, and the keys are likely behind, beneath, or within something that is blocking them from view. Because Mercury lies in Scorpio, a Water sign, the keys are low down wherever they are located.</p>
<p class="tx">The location of the missing item is shown by the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and its ruler. Cancer rules the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house in this chart, and the Moon occupies Taurus in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> quadrant house, which is the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> Whole Sign house. Water signs indicate a position low down and possibly near water. The angular Moon suggests that the keys are nearby, possibly in the home or in a place frequently used by the querent. The 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house by Whole Sign suggests a place where valuables are normally stored or kept. Taurus, an Earth sign, has a connection to vegetation, parks, and gardens, so the keys may be near something used outdoors.</p>
<p class="tx">On Tuesday, 12 November 2019, Kevin wrote that he had found the keys by accident in his wife’s backpack at about 6:55 p.m., less than three hours after he asked the horary question. He discovered the missing keys as he was putting a cell phone in a smaller zipper pocket below the main compartment of the backpack. The Moon was at 25<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Taurus (a little more than 1 degree away from Caput Algol), and the rising degree was approximately 13<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span>–14<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Gemini, which put Venus in her own term close to opposite the Ascendant degree. Kevin also noted that 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>-ruler Mercury was in his own term/bound, indicating that the keys were still in good condition.</p>
<p class="tx">As the chart indicated, the missing keys were with his wife’s possessions in a nearby place where she would normally keep them. Given the predominance of Water signs, the<span class="CharOverride-4">y</span> were found in a pocket <span class="ital">below</span> the main compartment of the backpack. The fact that the chart has a late degree rising may reflect Kevin’s discovery of the keys <span class="ital">by accident</span> rather than by intentionally following the clues provided by the horoscope.</p>
