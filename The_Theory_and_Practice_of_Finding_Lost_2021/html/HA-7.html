<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-12">THE MOON IN HORARY</p>
<p class="txni">A diagram from Peter Apian’s <span class="ital">Cosmographia</span> (1539) shows a model of the universe with the Earth at the center, surrounded by a series of spheres belonging to each of the visible planets, followed by the fixed stars and signs of the zodiac. The Deity dwells outside the final sphere, which is labeled the <span class="ital">primum mobile</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Of note here is that all celestial influences must pass through the sphere of the Moon before they can reach the Earth. In fact, in traditional astrology, the Earth is often referred to as the <span class="ital">sublunary world.</span> The practical application of this idea in horary astrology is that all celestial influences must pass through the <span class="ital">lunesphere</span> (to coin a term), with the implication that the state and behavior of the Moon mediates all other celestial influences before <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hey reach the Earth. The motion of the Moon in the horary chart thus reflects the flow of events related to the question. The last Ptolemaic aspect made by the Moon prior to the horary inquiry represents the recent past, and the next aspect the Moon will perfect refers to the immediate future.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Celestial Spheres</p>
<p class="txni">In <span class="ital">Anima Astrologiae</span>, Guido Bonatti draws an analogy between the phases of the Moon and the developmental life history of all organisms on Earth, whether they be rational, irrational, or vegetative:</p>
<p class="Q1">And as we see that in the New Moon she appears small and thin, and little, but afterwards her light gradually increases, till all that part of her body towards us becomes replenished with lustre: and then again it decays by insensible degrees till she totally disappears: just so do all bodies both of things Rational, Irrational, and Vegetative: as men grow until they are completed to their determinate stature, an<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> then droop and decline continually till their life is ended; and so of all other things.</p>
<p class="Q2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page76" title="76"></span>Hence ’tis necessary to make the Moon concerned in the Signification of every Question, Nativity, Enterprise and Business, and her good condition to show the good issue of the thing: and so on the contrary. For her Virtue and Power is such and so great, that if the Lord of the Ascendant or other Significator of a business be so weak and afflicted that he cannot bring it about and complete it as he ought: if she [the Moon] be but strong it shall, notwithstanding, be accomplished. For she <span class="CharOverride-4">i</span>s the School-mistress of all things; the Bringer-down of all the Planet’s influences, and a kind of an “internuncio” between them, carrying their virtues from one to the other, by receiving the disposition of one planet and bearing it to another<span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p class="Q3">And some have thought that she does this at all times, of which opinion was that Tyrant Cylinus de Romano, viz., That when she [the Moon] separates from one Planet, she takes the virtue and carries it to another, committing the same to the first that she can meet with. And some have imagined that “Zael” [Sahl] said <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he same; but his meaning was not absolutely so; for he believed that the Moon di<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> bear what was committed to her; but if it were not so given or committed to her she could not carry anything to any; to which I assent: for when the Moon is joined to any planet that receives her, then that planet commits its disposition to her, who carries it with her and bestows it on that planet whom she first meets with any of her dignities, and not to another: according to that Aphorism,—<span class="ital">“A Planet gives nothing in a place, where he has promised nothing” </span><span class="roman">[italics mine]. (Bona</span>tti, <span class="ital">Liber Astronomiae,</span> 1886, 11–12)</p>
<p class="tx">The main points in Bonatti’s quote are:</p>
<p class="list1">1. The Moon is a significator in every horary question.</p>
<p class="list2">2. Even if the ruler of the Ascendant or another significator of the matter is weak or afflicted and unable to effect a desired outcome, <span class="ital">a strong and well-fortified Moon can nonetheless indicate a successful outcome</span>.</p>
<p class="list2">3. The Moon can receive the disposition or virtue of a planet from whom she is separating and carry it to another planet to whom she is applying. </p>
<p class="list2">4. According to Zael (Sahl ibn Bishr) and Bonatti, such a transmission of influences by the Moon requires that the first planet receive the Moon in one of its dignities and <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hat the Moon meet the second planet “with any of her dignities.” Not all ancient authorities agree with the need for reception.</p>
<p class="list2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page77" title="77"></span>5. The dignities of a planet are regions of the zodiac where a given planet has the resources to promise assistance to another. In locations where a planet has no dignity, that planet has no resources to give. <span class="ital">A planet gives nothing in a place where he has promised nothing</span>.</p>
<p class="list2">6. Deborah Houlding, in her essay “The Moon as the Transmitter of Influences,” adds that in Lilly’s horary charts, “the Moon can only make a translation of light between <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>wo planets that are simultaneously within its reach,” that is, both planets must be within orb of the Moon (applying or separating) so that Luna can carry the virtu<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> of one planet to the other. Thus, Lilly ignores the advice of Zael (Sahl) and Bonatti about the need for reception and instead insists that the Moon be simultaneously within orb of the two planets involved in the translation of light.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Lilly: Will the Tradesman Be Rich?</p>
<p class="txni">Let’s see how Lilly used these ideas about the Moon in one of his charts. In 1634 a tradesman from London asked Lilly whether he would be rich. The data for the horary que<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>tio<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> are as follows: 26 July 1634, 11:04:21 a.m., London (51N30, 00W10), Regiomontanu<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> houses (<a href="HA-7.html">Chart 13</a>). It is a Mercury day during a Sun hour.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly reasons as follows.</p>
<p class="tx">The Libra Ascendant makes Venus the significator of the tradesman querent. The Moon “hath general signification in every Question” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 182).</p>
<p class="tx">The tradesman’s potential wealth is shown by the Scorpio 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, ruled by Mars. The Part of Fortune and its dispositor are also indicators of wealth. In this case, Mars rules the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp as well as <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly notes that the planet Mars, the <span class="ital">specific significator</span> of the querent’s wealth in this chart, is favorably placed in the angular 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house and is conjunct the fortunate fixed star Spica (at 18 Libra 44 in 1634). In addition, the Part of Fortune lies in Scorpio, a fixed sign showing enduring conditions; and <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae </span>lies in the terms of Mars, ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of wealth.</p>
<p class="tx">Here is the table of dignities for the tradesman’s chart with Lilly’s system of dignities (table 10). (In the Dorothean system, the Moon would occupy the terms of Mercury.)</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"></a>Table 10: Will the Tradesman Be Rich? Lilly’s System of Dignities </p>
<p class="tx">Lilly also studies Jupiter, a ge<span class="ital">neral significator </span>of wealth. Here, Jupiter closely conjoins the Midheaven and occupies Cancer, the sign of Jupiter’s exaltation. In addition, this propi<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ious Jupiter (at 17<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 36' Cancer) squares the Ascendant (at 14<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 13' Libra); but Lilly would argue that with Cancer and Libra being <span class="ital">signs of long ascension</span>, this square gets “stretche<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> out” (my words) and therefore has qualities of a favorable trine.</p>
<p class="tx">Next Lilly studies the Moon, ignoring the fact that she is slow, peregrine, and under the sunbeams (italics mine):</p>
<p class="Q4">I also found the Moon <span class="ital">separated</span> newly from a sextile to Mars, Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> and significator of the thing demanded [wealth], and immediately after [the Moon] <span class="ital">separated</span> from a conjunction of Mercury, then instantly <span class="ital">applying</span> to the conjunction of Venus, significator of the Querent, transferring thereby both the virtue and influence of Mercury and Mars to the proper significator of the Querent; the Moon is also disposed by the Sun and he is strong and powerful, and as she hath general <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page80" title="80"></span>signification in every Question, so being no ways unfortunate, she promised the Querent much good. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 181–182)</p>
<p class="tx">Note that Lilly appears to be ignoring the advice of Zahel (Sahl) and Bonatti about the Moon’s need for reception to carry out the transfer of light. Here the Moon at 19 Leo 04 lies in the domicile and triplicity of the Sun, the terms of Mercury (Dorothean system) or Jupiter (Lilly’s system), and the face of Jupiter. In Lilly’s system, the Moon does not occupy any of the dignities of Mercury, Venus, or Mars. Furthermore, Mercury, Venus, and Mars occupy none of the dignities of the Moon. Nonetheless, Lilly tells us that, despite the lack <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>f reception, the Moon is able to transfer the virtue and influence of both Mercury and Mars to the querent’s significator Venus.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly believes that his analysis of this chart is correct and reports that the tradesman informed him that he “had a good fortune with his Wife, both Money and Land; and for this Trading it hath been very good; for Jupiter in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> is a certain and infallible argument (according to natural causes) that the querent shall have plenty of Trading, or exercise a gainful Profession” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 183).</p>
<p class="tx">Although Lilly does not mention it, the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> par<span class="roman">t (dwad</span><span class="roman">)</span> of Mars resides at 14<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 12' Aries, exactly conjunct the cusp of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of his wife. Thus, the tradesman’s personal wealth (signified by Mars at 16<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 11' Libra, ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house and dispositor of the Part of Fortune) is closely tied to his wife, who brought “money and land” with her to the marriage.</p>
<p class="Ahead">A Ninth-Century Horary by Zahel (Sahl ibn Bishr) </p>
<p class="txni">William Lilly learned much of his horary technique from the works of the thirteenth-century Italian astrologer Guido Bonatti, who in turn drew heavily on the writings of the ninth-century astrologer Zahel (Sahl ibn Bishr al-Israili, aka Rabban al-Tabari, and often referred to as Zahel or Zael, c. 786– c. 845). </p>
<p class="tx">In his <span class="ital">Liber Astronomiae</span> (<span class="ital">Part IV: On Horary</span>, first part), Bonatti cites an example from Zahel’s <span class="ital">Book of Judgments</span> about a soldier who asked whether he would obtain a certain military governorship in that year. Although Bonatti doesn’t mention it, Zahel (Sahl) used the <span class="ital">sidereal</span> rather than the <span class="ital">tropical</span> zodiac used by most Western astrologers, including Lilly. Modern computer calculations give values slightly different from those listed by Bonatti, and it would not be possible to reconstruct the sign placements of the planets in Zahel’s chart using the tropical zodiac. A close approximation of the horary chart can be calculated using the following data: 5 July 824 (Tuesday), 3:19 a.m. LMT, Tehran, Ira<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> (35N40, 51E26), Porphyry houses (<a href="HA-7.html">Chart 14</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"></a>Chart 14: Zahel (aka Sahl ibn Bishr): Obtain the Government Office? <br/>5 July 824 (Tuesday), 3:19 a.m. LMT, Tehran, Iran, 35N40, 51E26. Moon day, Saturn hour. <br/>Porphyry houses. Usha-Shashi ayanamsa. Dwad of Ascendant is at 21<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 24' Aquarius.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page82" title="82"></span>Bonatti begins by stating that the Ascendant, its ruler, and the Moon signify the querent (the soldier), and the Midheaven and its ruling planet signify the government position inquired after.</p>
<p class="tx">With Gemini rising, Mercury becomes the querent’s significator. With Pisces on the Midheaven, Jupiter rules the governorship. Because Mercury has separated from Jupiter by a square aspect, the soldier will not get the desired promotion in that year, at least as far as Ascendant-ruler Mercury is concerned. </p>
<p class="tx">Next Bonatti considers the querent’s co-ruler, the Moon, which applies to oppose Jupiter (the quesited government position). Bonatti tells us that this applying Moon-Jupiter opposition means that the soldier could get the desired government post this year, but “with effort and uneasiness and also opposition, anxiety and the greatest worry” (Bonatti 1996, 28), because the action is brought about by an opposition rather than a sextile or trine.</p>
<p class="tx">So far the Ascendant-ruler Mercury says the solder will not get the promotion, but co-ruler Moon thinks the promotion is possible but only with great stress and difficulty. If the soldier were to be promoted, what would happen? Bonatti tells us that the answer to this question depends on what state Jupiter (the quesited) is in. If Jupiter is in good condition, matters will turn out well. Unfortunately, Jupiter in this case is in his first station and about to turn retrograde in just six days, that is, on July 11. Bonatti suggests that the retrograde Jupiter might mean that the person who currently holds the sought-for office could nix th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> querent’s chances of obtaining it.</p>
<p class="tx">Unfortunately, Bonatti does not tell us what eventually happened, so we don’t know whether this analysis was idle speculation or predicted the actual outcome of the question. This example does raise some interesting questions, however:</p>
<p class="tx">Which zodiac, tropical or sidereal, works best in horary?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-4">W</span>hich house system, Whole Sign or quadrant houses, works best?</p>
<p class="tx">Under what conditions can an applying <span class="ital">opposition</span> between significators bring about the matter inquired after?</p>
