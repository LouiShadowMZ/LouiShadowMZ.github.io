<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-29">LILLY: A DOG MISSING, WHERE?</p>
<p class="txni">This chapter reviews one of the classic horaries of William Lilly in which he uses the astrological chart drawn for the moment of the question to help locate the querent’s missing dog (<span class="ital">CA</span> 392–394). <a href="HA-24.html">Chart 23a</a> is in the square format found in Lilly’s text. There is a typo in the value of the Part of Fortune in Lilly’s chart; the correct value should be 3° 25' Capricorn rather than 9° 25' Capricorn. The chart that follows (chart 23b) was calculated in Solar Fire for the same horary moment using a modern ephemeris.</p>

<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page194" title="194"></span>Judgment Upon This Preceding Figure</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">Living in London where we have few or no small Cattle, as Sheep, Hogs, or the like, as in the Country; I cannot give example of such creatures, only I once set the Figure preceding concerning a Dog (who is in the nature of small Beasts) which Do<span class="CharOverride-4">g</span> was fled or missing. The Query unto me was, What part of the City they should search, next if he should ever recover him. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 392–393)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Lilly begins by telling us that he lives in London, where there are few small animals (“small cattle”), so he rarely receives a question (Query) about finding a creature signified by the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. One day, however, a querent did approach him with a question about a missing pet: “What part of the City should I search and will I recover my dog?” </p>
<p class="tx">The question is asked on a Saturn day (Saturday) during a Mars hour. Interestingly, Saturn rules the Capricorn Ascendant; and Mars and Saturn, being equally dignified, are almuten there. Mars is exalted and has dignity by face in Capricorn. Mars, which rules th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Ascendant by exaltation, lies in the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of pets.</p>
<p class="Q4">The Querent was signified by the Sign ascending and the Lord thereof; and indeed in his person he was Saturnine, and vitiated according to Cauda in the Ascendant, <span class="CharOverride-4">i</span>n his stature, mind or understanding; that is, was a little deformed in body, and extremely covetous in disposition, &amp;c. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 393)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Lilly begins by studying the Ascendant, which represents the person asking the question. If the chart is valid and able to provide an answer to the query, the Ascendant, the planet that rules the Ascendant, and planets in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house should accurately describe th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> querent. </p>
<p class="tx">Radical (valid) charts depend on the sincerity of the querent. Silly or insincere questions produce spurious charts. Questions of import to the querent, when sincerely asked with the expectation of receiving valuable guidance, produce charts that are reliable. Astrologers have developed various technical guidelines (“considerations before judgment”) to help determine whether a chart is radical, but the bottom line is that a radical chart accurately tells the story and reflects the five <span class="ital">W</span>s and one <span class="ital">H</span> of journalism (who, what, when, where, why, and how). </p>
<p class="tx">If the symbolism of the chart bears little or no resemblance to the actual circumstances, the chart is most likely not radical and will be of little use. Perhaps the querent is merely toying with the astrologer, is being devious, or really has in mind a more significant question that for some reason they are unwilling to reveal. Fortunately for students seeking<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page195" title="195"></span> radical charts to study, there are many groups online where members present sincere horary questions for delineation by the group.</p>
<p class="tx">In Lilly’s example of the missing dog, Capricorn rises and Saturn rules the Ascendant. In addition, the Moon’s South Node, of a malefic nature like Saturn, occupies the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house. The chart agrees with Lilly’s impression of the querent that in his person he was Saturnine and vitiated according to Cauda (the South Node, Tail of the Dragon) in the Ascendant, in his stature, mind, or understanding; that is, he was a little deformed in body and extremely covetous in disposition, etc. </p>
<p class="tx">Elsewhere Lilly speaks of the malefic influence of the Moon’s South Node (the Tail of the Dragon):</p>
<p class="Q4">For the Tail of the Dragon, I always in my practice found when he was joined with the evil Planets; their malice or the evil intended thereby was doubled and trebled, or extremely augmented, &amp;c. and when he chanced to be conjunction with any of the Fortunes who were significators in the question, though the matter by the principal significator was fairly promised, and likely to be perfected in a small time; yet did there ever fall out many rubs and disturbances, much wrangling and great controversy, that the business was many times given over for desperate ’ere a perfect conclusion could be had; and unless the principal significators were Angular and well-fortified with essential dignities, many times unexpectedly the whole matter came to nothing <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 83). [It’s as if you lift the Dragon’s Tail and its feces emerge to bury the querent.]</span></p>
<p class="tx">So far, the analysis of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house matches Lilly’s impressions of the querent, and the chart appears radical. Now it’s time to look at the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which describes small animals (up to about the size of a goat; large animals such as cows, horses, elephants, etc., belong to the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house).</p>
<p class="Q4">The Sign of the 6th and his Lord signifies the Dogge; so must they have done if it had been a Sheep or Sheep, Hogs, Conies, &amp;c. or any small Cattle. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 393)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Lilly next studies the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, because it represents the dog. If the question were about finding another type of thing or a person, the astrologer would examine the appropriate house. </p>
<p class="Q4">The Sign of Gemini is West and by South, the quarter of heaven is West; Mercury the Significator of the Dog, is in Libra a Western Sign but Southern quarter of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page196" title="196"></span>heaven, tending to the West; the Moon is in Virgo, a South-west Signe, and verging to the Western angle: the strength of the testimonies examined, I found the plurality to signify the West, and therefore I judged, that the Dog ought to be Westward from the place where the Owner lived, which was at Temple-barre, wherefore I judged that the Dog was about Long-acre, or upper part of Drury-lane. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 393)</span></p>
<p class="tx">To determine the whereabouts of the dog, Lilly notes (1) the sign on the cusp of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and in particular its quarter of heaven (determined by the sign’s element); (2) th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> sign that contains the ruler of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and its quarter of heaven; and (3) the sign of the Moon. Note that Lilly relies on the directions indicated by the zodiac signs rather than <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hose suggested by the houses.</p>
<p class="tx">Gemini on the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp is a “western” Air sign. The Air signs suggest the western quarter of heaven. Gemini suggests the <span class="ital">western quarter</span> of heaven (and, more specifically, West by South).</p>
<p class="tx">Mercury, which rules Gemini, lies in Libra (a westerly Air sign) in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. The direction of Libra is due west, so it clearly lies in the <span class="ital">western quarter</span> of heaven.</p>
<p class="tx">The Moon, because it constantly changes its appearance and moves faster than any of the visible planets, is a general signifier of “fugitives” (those who are fleeing, running away, or in hiding; from the Latin <span class="ital">fugere,</span> “to flee”). Notice that Lilly uses <span class="ital">specific signifiers</span> for the dog (the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and its ruler) as well as the <span class="ital">general signifier</span> of the fugitive dog, the Moon. The Moon lies in Virgo, an Earth sign that suggests the southern quarter of heaven, and the sign Virgo is specifically South by West.</p>
<p class="tx">In summary, Lilly judged that the dog ought to be westward from the place where its owner lived:</p>
<p class="list1">• Gemini: West and somewhat South</p>
<p class="list1">Libra: Due West </p>p&gt;
				<p class="list3 _idGenParaOverride-1">• Virgo: South and somewhat West</p>
<p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">Thus, the plurality of testimonies suggests a westerly direction.</p>
<p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-4">T</span>he compass directions attributed to the signs derives from their elemental nature (figure 5). In the so-called natural zodiac, the sign Aries rises in the east and points due east, the sign Cancer is due north, Libra is due west, and Capricorn is due south at the top of <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he chart (because the astrologers who developed the theory inhabited regions north o<span class="CharOverride-4">f</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he Equator and faced south toward the Midheaven when they studied the night sky; by extension,<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page197" title="197"></span> all Fire signs are easterly; all Water signs, northerly; all Air signs, westerly; and all Earth signs, southerly).</p>

Gemini is also the traditional ruler of the city of London. </p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">Because 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>-ruler Mercury (the missing pet) applies from 12<span lang="ar-SA" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span> Libra (an Air sign) to trine the dog’s Ascendant at 21<span lang="ar-SA" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span> Gemini (the cusp of the horary 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>), Lilly judges that<span class="ital"> “the Dog was not out of the lines of Communication, but in the same quarter; of which I was more confirmed by Sun and Saturn their Trine.”</span> The dog’s significator, Mercury, lies in the querent’s 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which is the dog’s derived 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house (3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>), suggesting that the dog took a short journey in its local neighborhood.</p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">As ruler of the horary Ascendant, Saturn signifies the querent who is about to receive a favorable trine from the Sun, perhaps bringing a little sunshine into his life. In addition, Saturn is retrograde and moving toward the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house Sun, while simultaneously the Sun is approaching a trine to Saturn. Such mutual application often indicates a speedy resolution of the matter. Lilly may have in mind that the Sun lying in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house can signify something kept private or hidden that may come to light. In addition, the Sun rules Leo, which is intercepted in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of thieves. Because of its interception, Leo is not visible on any house cusp but is contained wholly within a house.</p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">Note Lilly’s use of derived houses. The Ascendant of the horary chart belongs to the querent who asks the question. The 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is the first house of the dog and is thus considered the dog’s Ascendant in the system of derivative houses. If the question were about the querent’s child, the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house would be taken as the child’s Ascendant. If the queren<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> had inquired about his wife, the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house would be her Ascendant in the horary chart. In this chart, the dog’s ruler, Mercury, lies in the dog’s 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> (local environment). The querent’s ruler, Saturn, lies at the end of the horary 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> (the dog’s 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>—his master) and by th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> 5-degree rule is considered to be under the influence of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp (the dog’s 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of hopes and wishes) planet, suggesting that the dog wishes to be reunited with its master.</p><p class="Q4 _idGenParaOverride-1">The Sign wherein Mercury is in, is Libra, an airy Signe, I judged the Dog was in some chamber or upper room, kept privately, or in great secrecy: because Moo<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> was under the Beams of the Sun, and Mercury, Moon and Sun were in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, but because the Sun on Monday following did apply by Trine Dexter to Saturn Lord of the ascendant, and Moon to Sextile of Mars, having exaltation in the ascendant; I intimated, that in my opinion he should have his Dog again, or news of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page199" title="199"></span>his Dog or small Beast upon Monday following, or near that time; which was true; for a Gentleman of the Querent’s acquaintance, sent home the Dog the very same day about ten in the morning, who by accident coming to see a Friend in Long-acre, found the Dog chained up under a table, and knowing the Dog to be the Querent’s, sent him home, as above said, to my very great credit. Yet notwithstanding this, I cannot endure Questions of Fugitives or Thefts, nor ever would have done anything, but with intention to benefit Posterity. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 393–394)</span></p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">Mercury, the dog’s significator, lies in Libra, an Air sign, which suggests an upper location. In Aristotle’s theory of the elements, Fire and Air are both warm and have a tendency <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>o move outward and upward (heat rises). Water and Earth are both cold and tend to move downward and inward (toward the center of the earth).</p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">Lilly next judges that the dog is in a place that is kept private or in great secrecy (1) because the Moon (a general signifier of fugitives) is concealed under the bright beams of the Sun and (2) because Mercury (the dog’s significator), the Moon (fugitives), and the Sun occupy the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of one’s private parts and by analogy other matters that are kept privy or secret. Lilly explains elsewhere (<span class="ital">CA</span> 113) that a planet is “under the sunbeams” when it lies within 17 degrees on either side of the Sun. Here the Moon is considered to be under the influence of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house because it lies within 5 degrees of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp.</p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">Regarding timing, Lilly checked the ephemeris and noted that on Monday, 31 August 1646 OS, the transiting Sun at 17° 52' Virgo would perfect a trine to both transiting and horary Saturn at 3:26 p.m. and 4:19 p.m. UT, respectively. According to Lilly, “<span class="ital">a Gentleman of the Querent’s acquaintance sent home the Dog the very same day about ten in the morning.”</span> In the ephemeris, on Monday, August 31, the transiting Moon trines horary Jupiter at 9:32 a.m. and trines transiting Jupiter at 10:05 a.m. UT. Jupiter is a general signifier of good fortune an<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> also rules the cusp of the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of the querent’s hopes and wishes in this chart.</p><p class="Q4 _idGenParaOverride-1">Usually I find that all Fugitives go by the Moon, and as she varies her Sign, so the Fugitive wavers and shifts in his flight, and declines more or less to East, West, North or South: but when the Question is demanded, then without doubt you must consider the strength both of the Significator and the Moon, and judge by the stronger; if both be equivalent in Fortitudes, judge either by the Significator, if he best personate the Fugitive, or by the Moon, if she most resemble him; with relation to either of them that comes nearest in aspect to the cusp of the house, from whence significa<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ion is taken. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 394)</span></p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page200" title="200"></span>Lilly repeats that the Moon is a general significator of runaways and fugitives. As the Moon moves from sign to sign, making a complete cycle roughly every thirty days, so too does the fugitives shift in his flight. At the time a horary question is asked about the whereabouts of the runaway, the astrologer must decide from the chart whether the Moon (a general signifier) or the ruler of the house signifying the fugitive (a specific signifier) will <span class="CharOverride-4">g</span>ive the best judgment. This judgment is based on whether the Moon or the fugitive’s house cusp ruler is stronger. If they are equally strong, the astrologer chooses the signifier that best describes or resembles (personates) the runaway and also the significator that most closely aspects the fugitive’s house cusp (the fugitive’s derived Ascendant).</p>
<p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">In this case, Lilly did not consider antiscia (solstice points), but they may shed additional light on the outcome. Mercury (the dog) in Libra is ruled by Venus, whose antiscion at 21° 44' Taurus lies just inside the querent’s 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (home, end of the matter). The cusp of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is at 21° 00' Taurus, making Venus the ruler of the end of the matter. The antiscion of benefic Venus conjunct the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp suggests a favorable outcome, especially since Venus is the dispositor of the dog’s ruler, Mercury.</p>
