<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-26">WHERE ARE MY <br/>MISSING SUNGLASSES?</p>
<p class="txni">My wife is forever misplacing things like her keys and sunglasses, and she often turns to me to do a horary chart to find them. This one occurred during Memorial Day weekend of 2011. It was early Sunday afternoon when she wanted to go somewhere by car. She typically uses her sunglasses while driving, but they were nowhere to be found. At 2:55 p.m. EDT, she asked me to do a horary to locate the missing glasses. This chart was cast with Placidus houses, because I happened to have the computer set for Placidus at the time (chart 20). </p>
<p class="tx">It is a Sun day during a Sun hour. This seems fitting for a question about <span class="ital">sun</span>glasses that are used during travel by car (Sun in Gemini in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>). Venus rules the Ascendant, and Saturn is almuten there (the planet with the most essential dignity). The Sun and Saturn are both rulers of the Fire triplicity.</p>
<p class="tx">The 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of the Ascendant lies at 12<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 36' Sagittarius in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of local travel. My wife wanted the sunglasses to go somewhere by car. Jupiter rules the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part and is applying to the cusp of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of loss and death.</p>
<p class="tx">My wife’s signifiers are Venus (L1), Saturn (almuten of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>), and the Moon. (Here, L1 refers to the Lord of the 1st house.)</p>
<p class="tx">The missing sunglasses are represented by Mars, ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of movable goods in this chart. The Moon is a potential co-ruler of the missing item.</p>
<p class="tx">There is a strong emphasis on the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which often means that the item is lost (“dead”) or out in the garbage. However, my wife knew that she had driven home in her car with the sunglasses, and she had not gone out since, so they had to be somewhere on the property.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page180" title="180"></span>In response to the chart, we emptied the kitchen garbage can—an unpleasant task—but found no sunglasses there. I then asked her if she had recently thrown anything in a garbage can or trash bin. She thought for a minute and recalled that earlier that day she had done some weeding in the garden. We went out to the garage where the trash bin was kept and found her sunglasses amidst some weeds in the trash can.</p>
<p class="tx">In hindsight, I see that the principal significators are all in Taurus, a sign associated with growing crops and gardening. In addition, the Moon in Taurus (associated with gardens) is separating from a sextile to Neptune in the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, probably signifying my wife’s forgetfulnes<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> or carelessness during her recreational activity of gardening.</p>
