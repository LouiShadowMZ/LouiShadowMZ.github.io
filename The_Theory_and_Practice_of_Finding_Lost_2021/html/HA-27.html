<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-32">THE MISSING GARAGE DOOR REMOTE</p>
<p class="txni">My wife got home on the evening of 7 December 2017 and had misplaced her garage door remote, so she called me on her cell phone to go out and open the garage for her. She then asked me to help her look for the missing remote, which she had used earlier in the day <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>nd which she thought must be in her car. I cast a chart for the time she asked the question: 6:35 p.m. EST on 7 December 2017, 41N17, 73W02 (chart 28). </p>
<p class="tx">It is a Jupiter day during a Saturn hour. Ascendant-ruler Moon lies in Leo and hour-ruler Saturn lies in Sagittarius, both Fire signs.</p>
<p class="tx">The querent is ruled by the Moon (Cancer Ascendant).</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-4">T</span>he missing remote is signified by 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler Sun (Leo 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp).</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-4">T</span>he Moon, which signifies the querent, occupies the 2nd house of her movable possessions. Because the Moon is also a general signifier of lost or missing things, Moon in the 2nd house suggests that the missing remote may be in a place where she keeps her valuables.</p>
<p class="tx">The Moon is in partile trine to the Sun, and the centers of the Sun and the Moon are separated by only 11 minutes of arc. This is a perfect aspect, because the bodies of the Sun and the Moon are still overlapping by aspect.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly defines <span class="ital">separation</span> as </p>
<p class="Q4">when two Planets are departed but six minutes distant from each other.<span class="roman"> (</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 110)</span> </p>
<p class="tx">I assume that Lilly is measuring the distance between the centers of the bodies of the planets. This definition of separation may be true for the non-Luminaries, but Lilly does not take into account the <span class="ital">apparent sizes</span> (angular sizes) of the Sun and Moon, so his statement is somewhat misleading.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"></a>Chart 28: Missing Garage Door Remote <br/>7 December 2017, 6:35 p.m. EST, 41N17, 73W02. Jupiter day, Saturn hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 27<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 36' Capricorn.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page225" title="225"></span>In fact, the apparent size of the Sun in our sky is about 32 minutes of arc (radius 16' ), and the apparent size of the Moon is on average about 31 minutes of arc (radius 15.5' ). Thus, when the Luminaries are separated by only 11 minutes of arc, as in this chart, the bodies of the Sun and the Moon are still overlapping by aspect. For the Sun and Moon, true separation occurs only after they have moved apart at least 31.5 minutes of arc (the radius of the Sun plus the radius of the Moon). Sometimes the Moon is closer to the Earth and has an apparent size of about 34' of arc, in which case the radius of the Sun (16') plus the radius of the Moon (17') gives a result of 33' of arc as the minimum distance for separation between the two Luminaries.</p>
<p class="tx">In this chart, the perfect trine between the bodies of the Sun and the Moon, which have not yet separated, indicates that my wife will find the remote very quickly. The Sun rules the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp of where she keeps her valuables. She looks in her pocketbook a few minutes later, and there is the remote.</p>
<p class="tx">Note that Venus at its brightest has an angular size of about 1 minute of arc and is larger than any other planet in the night sky. The Sunâ€™s apparent size is thirty times greater than that of Venus at its brightest. The radius of Venus at its largest is 0.5' of arc. The radius of the body of the Sun is 16' of arc. Adding the two, we get 16.5 minutes of arc, which is found in the definition of <span class="ital">cazimi</span>, or being in the heart of the Sun. Lilly is a bit more generous and defines <span class="ital">cazimi</span> as the centers of the Sun and the planet being <span class="ital">at least 17 </span><span class="ital CharOverride-4">m</span><span class="ital">inutes of arc apart</span>. Because the Sun and the Moon have almost exactly the same apparent size in our sky, we should also consider a non-Luminary planet to be separated from the Moon only after the centers of the two bodies are about 17 minutes of arc apart.</p>
