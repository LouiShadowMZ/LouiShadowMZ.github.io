<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-34">WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GIRL?</p>
<p class="txni">According to news reports, on 21 September 2013, a young couple found the dead body of a twelve-year-old girl in a wooded area a few miles from her family’s cottage. The corpse turned out to be that of a local girl who had been adopted from China at age one by a wealthy family in Spain. The police investigation revealed that she had recently been texting friends that she thought her parents were trying to kill her, perhaps by poisoning her with drugs. Teachers reported that the girl had come to class appearing drugged, confused, and sleepy on a few occasions.</p>
<p class="tx">The mother told police that she allegedly last saw her daughter on Saturday, 21 September 2013, at 7:00 p.m. However, the police found witnesses who had seen the girl with her father at 6:18 p.m., and they also recovered video footage showing the girl with her mother in her car at 6:22 p.m. Because the police caught the parents in a series of demonstrable lies, they accused the parents of murdering the child. When she died, the girl was a week and a half away from her thirteenth birthday. The autopsy confirmed that she had been drugged with benzodiazepines over an extended period, and she had a high level of the drugs in her system on the night she died.</p>
<p class="tx">Here is the chart, with Regiomontanus houses, for the last sighting of the girl on 21 September 2013 at 6:22 p.m. CEDT in Santiago de Compostela, Spain (chart 30).</p>
<p class="tx">Aquarius rises, making Saturn the significator of the missing girl. Because Saturn lies in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, Lilly’s dictum—namely, that the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house ruler in houses 9, 10, or 11 suggests <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hat the missing person is probably alive (<span class="ital">CA</span> 151)—applies to this chart. Unfortunately, Saturn is closely conjunct the Moon’s nodes, which are considered “fateful” degrees and give a more ominous indication. In addition, Saturn at 9<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 02' Scorpio lies in the <span class="ital">via combusta,</span> suggesting a matter that is obscured (deprived of light), “burnt,” or being kept secret<span class="ital">.</span> </p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page232" title="232"></span>The Moon is the girl’s co-significator. Planets in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house also describe the missing person. Neptune is conjunct Chiron, and both are retrograde, which may indicate that she has been drugged, poisoned, or wounded in some way.</p>

<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page233" title="233"></span>Death is shown by the Virgo 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, ruled by Mercury. Both the Sun and Mercury occupy the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death. In addition, Libra is intercepted in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, making Venus a ruler of her death (by domicile, since Venus rules Libra), as well as Saturn (which is exalted in Libra).</p>
<p class="Ahead">The Moon’s Nodes, Their “Bendings,” and the Workings of Fate</p>
<p class="txni">As mentioned, Saturn (the girl’s signifier) lies in Scorpio in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and is conjunct the Moon’s mean North Node. Some horary astrologers believe that the degree of the Moon’s nodes implies a fated, though not necessarily fateful, event that is for some reason outside of the querent’s control. Such happenings may involve being in the wrong place at the right time, or some permutation of this popular phrase. Often significators in a nodal degree imply that what will happen is either in the hands of someone else or is due to the querent’s automatic or habitual patterns of behavior undertaken without consideration of potential consequences (<a href="HA-29.html">Figure 7</a>).</p>
<p class="tx">Ivy Goldstein-Jacobson wrote in an ominous tone that “any planet or angle in the same degree as the nodes points to a catastrophe, casualty, fatality or tragedy in a horary or natal chart, the more far-reaching when a malefic is involved” (Goldstein-Jacobson 1960, 52). She used the Moon’s <span class="ital">mean</span> nodal positions rather than the so-called “true” lunar nodes, which are calculated to include the effect of the Sun’s gravity on the Moon’s orbit around the Earth. Olivia Barclay agreed with Goldstein-Jacobson that any planet in the degree of <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he nodes is <span class="ital">unfortunate.</span> (Barclay 1990, 105) </p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"></a>Figure 7: Lunar Nodes Diagram: <br/>The lunar nodes are the points of intersection of the apparent (geocentric) orbits of the Sun and Moon around the Earth. The “bendings” occur at the points where the orbits of the Sun and the Moon are most separated (in a north-south direction) from each other.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page234" title="234"></span>The use of the lunar nodes in this way in horary astrology appears to be a modern idea not found in Lilly’s works or other traditional sources. Nonetheless, the lunar nodes in traditional astrology were important as places where eclipses occurred, and eclipses were universally feared as malevolent omens because they blocked the life-giving light of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Luminaries and allowed evil forces to emerge from the darkness.</p>
<p class="tx">Goldstein-Jacobson and Barclay may have confounded the meanings of <span class="ital">fated</span> and <span class="ital">fateful</span> in their interpretations of nodal degrees. I have seen several horary charts with significators in nodal degrees where matters turned out well. See, for example, the example of Molly’s missing voice recorder in <a href="HA-1.html">Chapter 1</a>. In Molly’s horary chart (<a href="HA-1.html">Chart 3</a>), both the Ascendant ruler and the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler lie in degrees of the Moon’s mean nodes, yet sh<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> quickly found the missing device and it was in good condition. Perhaps the nodal degre<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> in this case implies that it was Molly’s <span class="ital">destiny</span> to misplace the recorder so that she could write about it in her astrology blog. In her horary chart, the North Node lies in Pisces in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of writing. Her Ascendant-ruler Jupiter disposes the North Node. Neptune, <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he modern ruler of Pisces, conjoins the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house cusp of communications. In addition<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he Aquarius 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house cusp has as its traditional ruler Saturn, which lies in Leo in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of publishing.</p>
<p class="tx">Rather than the degree of the Moon’s mean nodes being universally <span class="ital">unfortunate</span>, as Barclay believes, I suspect that it has more to do with the individual’s fate, karma, destiny, o<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> habitual unconscious patterns of behavior. An event can be “fated” without being fateful or catastrophic. <span class="ital">Fated</span> simply means subject to, guided by, or determined by fate rather than by the querent’s conscious will. A fated event is one that is beyond the querent’s active intentional control. Such events can be either favorable or unfavorable. In addition, fate is often of our own making as we repeat habitual patterns from our past, going with the flow rather than actively seeking expert guidance to learn more effective ways to accomplish our goals.</p>
<p class="tx">In the girl’s “last seen” chart (<a href="HA-30.html">Chapter 30</a>), Saturn in the nodal degree is highly significant because Saturn <span class="ital">conjoins</span> the Moon’s North Node, rules the Ascendant (the querent), and also rules the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of secret enemies and undoing. Interestingly, Saturn occupies Scorpio, a sign associated with poisoning. </p>
<p class="tx">In addition, Pluto (at the cusp of the unfortunate 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house) squares the Moon’s nodes, a condition often called “being at the bendings” of the nodes. A planet <span class="ital">at the bendings</span> can represent a crisis or turning point in the querent’s life. The <span class="ital">bendings</span> are the points on the Moon’s orbit where it reaches maximum distance from the Sun’s orbit and changes direction<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page235" title="235"></span> from north to south, or south to north, with respect to the path of the Sun. Being at <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he bendings is analogous to the Sun changing direction from north to south, or south to north, at the summer and winter solstices. </p>
<p class="tx">As Kevin Burk notes in his <span class="ital">Complete Node Book</span>: </p>
<p class="Q4">In classical astrology, a planet that was square the nodes was said to be <span class="ital">at the bendings</span>, and this planet would become a focal point of change and crisis for the individual. (Burk 2003, 212)</p>
<p class="tx">One experienced astrologer, Astrojin at Skyscript.co.uk, delineates a planet that is in square aspect to the Moon’s nodes as follows: </p>
<p class="Q4">When a planet is conjoined to the lunar bendings (square the nodes), it can mean crisis due to unwelcome change or things will bend in the direction that is away from that which is proper. (Astrojin 2011)</p>
<p class="tx">I would add that the change symbolized by the bendings may not necessarily be “unwelcome” or “improper” but may simply be something unexpected, not customary, or different from the habitual way things have been happening up to that point.</p>
<p class="tx">In addition, in this chart, the Moon is void of course, according to both the modern definition and Lilly’s criteria. The Moon is in a kind of limbo state, because she is not applying to any planet from her current position and will not perfect any aspect before leaving Aries. Lilly says of the VOC Moon: </p>
<p class="Q4">You shall seldom see a business go handsomely forward when she is so. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 112)</p>
<p class="tx">The Moon is also peregrine (in a place where she has no essential dignity) at her position in Aries, suggesting that the girl is without protection, assistance, or support. </p>
<p class="tx">At this point we can say with some confidence that the girl (Ascendant-ruler Saturn) may be involved in some fateful event over which she has little or no control (Saturn in a lunar nodal degree). Furthermore, the matter of the girl will not go handsomely forward (Moon VOC in Aries, where it is without dignity) and may end in an undesired manner. We want to find the girl alive, but the VOC Moon suggests that this matter is not likely to go handsomely forward.</p>
<p class="tx">The last aspect made by the Moon was an opposition to Mercury, ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> and occupying the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death. The Moon (co-ruler of the girl and a general signifier <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>f missing persons) will enter within orb of opposing Saturn before she leaves Aries. Saturn <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page236" title="236"></span>is afflicted, being conjunct a lunar node and ruling the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of undoing and, through exaltation, the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death (Libra is intercepted in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, and Saturn is exalted in Libra). In addition, Mercury rules the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp of death, and Mercury lies i<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> Libra, which is ruled by Venus and where Saturn is exalted. </p>
<p class="tx">The Moon (co-ruler of the girl) begins to apply to oppose Saturn toward the end of Aries and goes on to perfect an opposition in early Taurus to Saturn and then to Venus. Saturn rules her 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of secret enemies and, by exaltation, her 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death<span class="CharOverride-4">.</span> Venus rules Libra, which is intercepted in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death. Venus also rules the end-of-the-matter 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which also signifies her parents. </p>
<p class="tx">Traditional horary astrologers consider only the five major Ptolemaic aspects. A modern astrologer, in contrast, would note the closely applying quincunx from the Moon in Aries (the missing person) to the Sun in Virgo at the cusp of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death. The quincunx, as a modern aspect, can be considered to have 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> and 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house significanc<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> (sickness, difficult adjustments, and death) because it involves two zodiac signs that ar<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> either six or eight signs apart.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, I should mention that this is an <span class="ital">event chart</span> for the time the girl was last seen rather than a horary chart asked by someone personally involved in the case. I have noticed that in “last seen” event charts in which the person is eventually found dead, th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is frequently <span class="ital">conjunct</span> <span class="ital">but separating from</span> the ruler of the Ascendant. (Sometimes the rulers of the Ascendant and the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house are separating from a square or opposition that is still within orb.) In horary charts, a separating aspect refers to events that have already transpired. In “last seen” <span class="ital">event</span> charts for missing persons, a conjunction, square, or opposition that is still within orb between the Ascendant ruler and the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ruler implies that the missing person is dead, even if the two significators are separating. In this girl’s case, Venus rules the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, because Libra is intercepted in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death, and Venus is separating from a conjunction with Ascendant-ruler Saturn.</p>
<p class="tx">All in all, this “last seen” chart fairly well describes the murder of this unfortunate adopted girl from China.</p>
