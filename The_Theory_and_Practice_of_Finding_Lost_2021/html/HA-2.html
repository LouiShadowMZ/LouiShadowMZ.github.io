<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-7">LILLY’S GUIDELINES FOR JUDGING <br/>A HORARY CHART (1647)</p>
<p class="txni">Guido Bonatti was a celebrated thirteenth-century Italian mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer. Bonatti (aka Bonatus) advises the horary astrologer to take careful note of the motivation of the querent in asking the question. Does the person show serious intent, or is the inquiry simply about some trifling matter and asked on a whim out of idle curiosity? Is the question a matter of honest or urgent importance to the querent? Has the querent been pondering the issue “for the space of a day and night or longer” before seeking the help of an astrologer? Is the question about something that happened without warning and of crucial importance to the querent (such as the kidnapping of a child)? You can see, from Bonatti’s words and Lilly’s commentary, that horary generally should be reserved <span class="CharOverride-4">f</span>or current matters of pressing personal concern, sincerely inquired about, whose answers will make a notable difference in the life of the querent. With regard to lost or missing things, the implication is that the loss should be rather recent and of significant import <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>o the querent. The following excerpt is from the translation by William Lilly and Henry Coley of “Treatise V” of Bonatti’s <span class="ital">Liber Astronomiae</span>. </p>
<p class="Q1">The first, is to observe what it is that moves a person to propose or ask a question of an Astrologer; where we must take notice of three motions: the First, of the mind, when a man is stirred up in his thoughts and hath an intent to enquire; the Second<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> of the superior and celestial bodies; so that they at that time imprint on the thing enquired after, what shall become of it; the Third, of the free will which disposes him to the very act of enquiring; for although the mind be moved to enquire, ’ti<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> not enough unless the superior bodies sympathize therewith; nor is such motion of the stars enough, unless by the election of his will the person does actually enquire.</p>
<p class="Q1 ParaOverride-4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page22" title="22"></span>The second consideration is (what we hinted at before) the method or manner everyone ought to observe that enquires of an Astrologer; which is, that when he intends to take an artist’s judgment of things past, present, or to come, he should, first, with a devout spirit, pray unto the Lord, from whom proceeds the success of every lawful enterprise, that he would grant him the knowledge of those things of the truth of which he would be resolved; and then let him apply himself to the astrologer with a serious intent of being satisfied in some certain and particular doubt, and this not on trifling occasions, or light sudden emotions, much less on matters base or unlawful, as many ignorant people used to do; but in matters of honest importance, and such as have possessed and disturbed his mind for the space of a day and night or longer; unless in sudden accidents which admit not of delay.</p>
<p class="Q2">***Note by Lilly.—Those that take this sober course, shall find the truth in what they enquire after; but whosoever do otherwise, deceive both themselves and the artist; for a foolish Querent may cause a wise Respondent to err, which brings a scandal upon Art amongst inconsiderable people, whereas the Astrologer is not blamable, but the ignorant silly Querent. (Bonatti, <span class="ital">Liber Astronomiae</span>, 1–2)</p>
<p class="Ahead">Example of a “Non-radical” Question</p>
<p class="txni">My brother-in-law is a total skeptic about astrology. He once asked, “When we moved to a new house ten years ago, I misplaced my coin collection. If you can do a chart and find my missing coins, I will believe in astrology.” Clearly the matter was not one of current pressing personal concern, as he waited ten years to ask the question. In addition, his motivation appeared to be more to ridicule the art of astrology than to find his missing coins.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Lilly’s Criteria for a Radical Chart</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly writes:</p>
<p class="Q4">All the ancients that have wrote of questions do give warning to the astrologer, that before he deliver judgement he should consider whether the figure is radical and capable of judgement. The question then shall be taken for radical, or fit to be judged, when the lord of the hour at the time of proposing the question, and erecting the figure, and the lord of the ascendant or first house, are of one triplicity, or be one, or of the same nature. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 121)</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly goes on to give the following examples of this principle. Suppose that the lord of the hour is <span class="ital">Mars</span>, then the following would be true:</p>
<p class="list1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page23" title="23"></span>• Because Mars is a <span class="ital">ruler of the Water triplicity</span>, the chart will be radical because a watery sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) rises on the Ascendant. In other words, if the hour ruler and the Ascendant ruler are also rulers of the same triplicity, then the chart will be radical.</p>
<p class="list2">• If Aries (or Scorpio) rises, then the chart is radical because Mars is the domicile ruler of the sign on the Ascendant. In other words, Mars rules both the hour of the question and the Ascendant of the chart. </p>
<p class="list2">• If Leo rises, then the Sun rules the Ascendant; and the chart is radical because the Sun and Mars are both “hot and dry” planets, that is, they are of the same nature.</p>
<p class="list2">• Lilly does <span class="ital">not</span> mention how to decide radicality if the sign of exaltation of the hour ruler is on the Ascendant. Here, for example, with Mars ruling the hour, if Capricorn were rising, would the chart be considered radical?</p>
<p class="list2">• Note that Lilly uses only the day and night rulers of the triplicities and does not consider the participating rulers, thus limiting the number of charts that might be considered radical using this criterion. Many horary astrologers, myself included, prefer the system of triplicity rulers of Hellenistic astrologer Dorotheus of Sidon, who assigned three planets to the signs of each element as follows:</p>
<p class="List-indent-sa">~ Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn rule Fire.</p>
<p class="List-indent"><span class="CharOverride-4">~</span> Venus, Moon, and Mars rule Earth.</p>
<p class="List-indent"><span class="CharOverride-4">~</span> Saturn, Mercury, and Jupiter rule Air.</p>
<p class="List-indent"><span class="CharOverride-4">~</span> Venus, Mars, and Moon rule Water.</p>
<p class="Ahead">The Missing Earpiece? <br/>A Question Asked on a “Light Sudden Emotion”</p>
<p class="txni">On 22 October 2015, my wife came home from work feeling tired and exhausted. She’d had a stressful day at the office and just wanted to relax. A short while later, she asked if I <span class="CharOverride-4">h</span>ad seen the Bluetooth earpiece for her iPhone. She was sure she had it with her when she entered the house, but now she couldn’t find it. Without expending much effort in search of the misplaced item, she asked instead if I would do a horary chart to find it.</p>
<p class="tx">I tried to explain that tradition advises that horary be a last resort after other avenues have been tried. At the time of the question, she had barely looked for the missing object and simply felt too tired to do so. Curious whether the chart would reflect her mental state as well as her asking the question on a “light sudden emotion,” I noted the time and cast the chart. It was Thursday, 22 October 2015, at 6:03 p.m. EDT, 41N17, 73W02, a Jupiter day during a Moon hour (<a href="HA-2.html">Chart 4</a>).</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Chart 4: Missing Bluetooth Earpiece<br/>6:03 p.m. EDT, 22 October 2015, 41N17, 73W02. Jupiter day, Moon hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 20° 36' Taurus. Early degree rising.</p>
<p class="Bhead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page25" title="25"></span>An Early or a Late Degree Rising</p>
<p class="txni"><span class="CharOverride-4">A</span>n early degree rising is one of the <span class="ital">considerations before judgment</span> that advises the astrologer to be cautious when interpreting the chart because matters may be in a very early stage of development. Astrologer Elbert Benjamine (C.C. Zain) notes that when less than 3 degrees rise on the Ascendant, the horary question is like an unborn fetus, which is still “undergoing gestation” and “not as yet completely formed,” so that there may be “insufficient data upon which to base a correct answer” (Zain 1969, 117). Derek Appleby interprets an early degree rising to mean that “the question is <span class="ital">premature</span> and judgment cannot be given—it is too early to say” (Appleby 1985, 14).</p>
<p class="tx">In contrast, when more than 27 degrees rise on the Ascendant, the question is more like a person in the throes of death, suggesting that the horary question may be obsolete, having been “outgrown by new conditions” (Zain 1969, 117), and the querent will have little or no say in the outcome. Derek Appleby interprets a late degree rising to mean that “the matter has passed beyond the point where judgment can be given—it is too late to say” (Appleby, 1985, 14). In other words, the Ascendant lying at the end of a sign can indicate that the question is being asked at a very late stage in the development of the question, so that the chart may not provide effective guidance. However, if an early or a late degree rising accurately describes the situation or has a close connection with the querent’s natal chart, this guideline may not apply. The late degrees of signs are typically in the terms of the malefics, Mars or Saturn, and perhaps for this reason Sue Ward comments:</p>
<p class="Q4">Late degrees often ascend in horaries about life or death situations (as with the Moon in late degrees) and so, are descriptive. Lateness often shows an imminent change in circumstances, but on the ascendant for no known reason, is cautionary. (Ward 1996)</p>
<p class="tx">As with all horary guidelines, readers are encouraged to test these “considerations before judgment” and see how they play out in their own horary charts. Most likely the early Ascendant in this horary reflects the fact that my wife had hardly searched for th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> missing item, even though she knew it was in the house and she probably could hav<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> found it without much effort. Astrologer Deborah Houlding notes that early degrees rising in a horary chart often indicate that the question “was born out of impatience rather than genuine concern” (Houlding 1993, 37).</p>
<p class="tx">In this horary chart, Venus rules the Taurus Ascendant and signifies the querent. Venus occupies the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, where she conjoins the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp. In traditional horary, the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> is one <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page26" title="26"></span>of the “unfortunate” houses and has come to signify physical ailments, drudgery, and illness. Venus in the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in Virgo probably reflects my wife’s state of exhaustion after a hard day at work. Venus (the querent) is separating from an opposition to Neptune, suggesting that she mislaid the earpiece due to confusion or carelessness.</p>
<p class="tx">Mercury rules the Gemini 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> cusp of the querent’s movable goods. Thus, the winged planet is the signifier of the missing earpiece. Mercury in the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> suggests that she may have mislaid the item in a place where she performs routine tasks. Mercury in Libra, an Air sign, suggests a location above waist level, possibly in an upper part of the room or a<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> upper room, on a shelf, or on top of a piece of furniture. Mercury in the cadent 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is under the sunbeams, so the earpiece is hidden from view, perhaps behind or beneath something, and it may be hard to find. The good news is that Mercury (the missing item) lies in Libra, ruled by Venus (the querent), and Venus lies in Virgo, ruled by Mercury. There is no applying aspect between Mercury and Venus, which lie in adjacent signs, so technically speaking, this configuration would be called “sharing each other’s <span class="ital">generosity</span>” rather than “mutual reception.” Nonetheless, such a strong connection between significators is a positive indication that she will be able to find the missing earpiece.</p>
<p class="tx">To clarify the difference between <span class="ital">generosity</span> and <span class="ital">mutual reception</span>, let me quote the definitions given by astrologer Joy Usher:</p>
<p class="Q4"><span class="ital">Generosity</span> is a term used to describe two planets in each other’s sign with no aspect between them. <span class="ital">Mutual reception</span> describes two planets in each other’s sign who also share a Ptolemaic aspect. (Usher 2018, 122)</p>
<p class="tx">Derek Appleby notes that when two planets occupy each other’s domiciles—in other words, share each other’s <span class="ital">generosity</span>—the querent usually has some type of choice in the matter and may receive assistance from a third party in achieving a positive outcome or find an “escape route from a difficult situation” (Appleby 1985, 35).</p>
<p class="tx">Another factor to consider is the Part of Fortune, which can signify the querent’s material possessions. In this chart, <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae</span> lies in Capricorn in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> and is disposed by Saturn (ruler of Capricorn) and by Mars through its exaltation in Capricorn. Venus advancing to conjoin first Jupiter and then Mars was an argument that she would recover the mislaid item.</p>
<p class="tx">Saturn, which rules <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae</span>, lies in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which represents me. Mars rules the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp, which also represents me. In addition, the Moon’s next aspect is a trine to the Sun, which closely conjoins the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp. I study the chart and look on the kitchen <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page27" title="27"></span>table, where my wife had put her pocketbook and the day’s mail. There, amidst several objects that she had placed on the kitchen table and beneath a bag containing a book, was her missing earpiece.</p>
<p class="tx">Since this chart has an early Ascendant, the advice of horary astrologer Alphee Lavoie may apply. Lavoie has found that “there is a strong correlation between extremely late or early degrees in a sign and locating a lost article near a door, window, gate or in a box o<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> package, and that <span class="ital">the article is about to be moved</span> [italics mine]. The same … holds true when the ruler of the second house is within two degrees of any house cusp” (Lavoie 1995). I<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>his chart, the missing earpiece was ultimately found amidst several items that were soo<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>o be moved off the kitchen table. </p>
<p class="Ahead">Lilly: Of the Time of Receiving Any Question</p>
<p class="txni">In <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span>, Lilly outlines his criteria for deciding when to erect a horary chart for a question. He is explicit that <span class="ital">the true hour of receiving any question is when the querent propounds his desire to the Astrologer</span>. If he receives a horary question by letter, then <span class="ital">the very hour and minute when he breaks it open and perceives the intention of the querent is the time to erect the horary chart.</span> Lilly is clear that he casts a horary chart for his location and for the exac<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> moment when he (the astrologer) clearly understands what the querent wants to know by means of astrology. According to Lilly, astrologers may also interpret their own horary charts, provided they are able to do so with impartiality.</p>
<p class="tx">As quoted in the previous section, Lilly would not accept questions unless the querent came</p>
<p class="Q4">with a serious intent of being satisfied in some certain and particular doubt, and this not on trifling occasions, or light sudden emotions, much less on matters base or unlawful …; but in matters of honest importance, and such as have possessed and disturbed his mind for the space of a day and night or longer; unless in sudden <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>ccidents which admit not of delay. (Bonatti, <span class="ital">Liber Astronomiae</span>, 1–2)</p>
<p class="tx">Trivial questions, asked on a whim or not about matters of honest importance to the querent, will not generate valid horary charts. In other words, horary questions must b<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> asked with sincerity and be about matters of genuine personal significance, which the qu<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span>rent has been pondering for at least twenty-four hours. Here is what Lilly said about when to cast the chart:</p>
<p class="Q1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page28" title="28"></span>It hath been disputed largely amongst the Arabians, who were excellent in the resolution of Horary Questions, what time the Astrologer should take for the ground of his Question, whether that time when the Querent first comes into one’s House <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>r Closet, or first salutes the Artist, whether that is to be admitted for the most proper time of erecting a Figure, and giving Judgment thereupon.</p>
<p class="Q2">Though some have consented to this opinion, yet I could never be satisfied herein either with reason or experience; for let us admit one comes to demand a Resolution of me, and we converse together a good while; but in the end, some occasion intervenes, and we depart: I hope no sound Judgment will allow of this time to be the Radix of a Question (when as none is really demanded) viz. at what <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ime he first saw me, or entered my house and spoke with me.</p>
<p class="Q2">Without doubt the true hour of receiving any Question is then, when the Querent propounds his desire unto the Astrologer, even that very moment of time, in my opinion, is to be accepted: for let us suppose a Letter is sent or delivered unto <span class="CharOverride-4">m</span>e, wherein I am desired to resolve some doubts; perhaps I receive the Letter int<span class="CharOverride-4">o</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">m</span>y hands at 3:00 in any day of the week, but in regard of some occasions, do not read it until 4 or 5 hours after; that very hour and minute of hour when I break i<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> open, and perceive the intention of the Querent, is the time to which I ought to erect my Figure, and from thence to draw mine Astrological Judgment:</p>
<p class="Q2">This way and manner have I practiced, and found success answerable: And whereas Bonatus and some others do give warning that the Astrologian judge not his own Question, and say he cannot tell how to accept of a question from himself; this I conceive was his reason, Because he thought the Artist would be partial to himself in his judgment: Verily I am of a contrary opinion and have found by many experiments, that at what hour the mind or intention of the Astrologer is heavil<span class="CharOverride-4">y</span> perplexed with or concerning the success of any matter wherein himself is reall<span class="CharOverride-4">y</span> concerned, I say he may with great reason accept of that hour for the true time of erecting his Scheme of Heaven, and he may (if not partial) as well judge of that Figure erected by himself, as of any other; but herein I advise him to lay aside all love and partiality unto his own Cause. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 166 –167)</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page29" title="29"></span>Lilly: Definitions of Significator, Querent, and Quesited, <br/>and Introduction to the Judgment of a Question</p>
<p class="Q1"><span class="med">Chapter XX. What Significator, Querent and Quesited are; and an Introduction to the Judgment of a Question.</span></p>
<p class="Q2">The Querent is he or she that propounds the question, and desires resolution: the Quesited is he or she, or the thing sought and enquired after.</p>
<p class="Q2">The Significator is no more than that Planet which rules the house that signifies the thing demanded: as if Aries is ascending, Mars being the Lord of Aries, shall be significator of the Querent, viz., the Sign ascending shall in part signify his corporature, body or stature, the Lord of the Ascendant, the Moon and Planet in the Ascendant, or that the Moon or Lord of the Ascendant are in aspect with, shall shew his quality or conditions equally mixed together; so that let any Sign ascend, what Planet is Lord of that Sign, shall be called Lord of the House, or Significator of the person enquiring, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="Q2">So that in the first place therefore, when any Question is propounded, the Sign ascending and his Lord are always given unto him or her that asks the question.</p>
<p class="Q2">2. You must then consider the matter propounded, &amp; see to which of the twelve houses it doth properly belong: when you have found the house, consider the Sign and Lord of that Sign, how, and in what Sign and what part he is placed, how dignified, what aspect he hath to the Lord of the Ascendant, who impedites your Significator, who is friend unto him, viz., what Planet it is, and what house he is Lord of, or in what house posited; from such a man or woman signified by that Planet, shall you be furthered or hindered; or of such relation unto you as that Planet signifies; if Lord of such a house, such an enemy, if Lord of such a house as signifies enemies, then an enemy verily; if of a friendly house, a friend: The whole natural key to all Astrology reflect in the words preceding rightly understood: By the Examples following I shall make all things more plain; for I do not desire, or will reserve anything whereby the Learner may be kept in suspense of right understanding what is useful for him, and most fit to be known.</p>
<p class="Q2">In every question we do give the Moon as the Cosignificator with the querent or Lord of the Ascendant (some have also allowed the Planet from whom the Moon <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page30" title="30"></span>separated as a Significator; which I no way approve of, or in my practice could ever find any Verity therein.) </p>
<p class="Q2">In like manner they joined in judgment the Planet to whom the Moon applied at time of the question, as Cosignificator with the Lord of the house of the thing quesited, or thing demanded.</p>
<p class="Q2">Having well considered the several applications and separations of the Lords of those houses signifying your question, as also the Moon, the scheme of Heaven and quality of the aspect the Moon, and each significator hath to other, you may begin to judge and consider whether the thing demanded will come to pass yea or no; by what, or whose means, the time when, and whether it will be good for the Querent to proceed further in his demands yea or no. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 123–124)</p>
<p class="Ahead">Description of the Querent According to the <br/>Type of Sign Ascending</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">In the Question or Figure of Heaven, if the Planet who is Lord of the Ascendant be in a moveable [cardinal] Sign, and the Sign ascending be also one, it denotes the person to be unstable, and of no resolution, easily mutable, perverted, a wavering inconstant man.</p>
<p class="Q2">Let us admit the Ascendant to be fixed, and the Lord of that Sign also in a fixed Sign, you may judge the party to be of firm resolution, no changeling; or as we say, one that will stand to maintain what he hath said or done, be it good or ill.</p>
<p class="Q2">If the Sign ascending be common [mutable], and the Lord of that Sign also in a Common Sign, you may judge the man or woman to be neither very willful nor easily variable but between both. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 89)</p>
<p class="Ahead">Additional Significators in Horary Charts</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly primarily made use of planetary rulers of house cusps as well as the Moon as significators in horary charts. At times, however, he utilized the house cusps themselves, planets within a house, or planets from which the Moon had just separated or to which the Moon <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>as next applying. In his horary about the houses of Master B (<span class="ital">CA</span> 220), which had a<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> Aries 7th house cusp, instead of using Mars to signify the seller, Lilly went with the Su<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> in the 7th house as the seller because it best described Master B. Lilly’s instructions about buying and selling real estate are instructive in this regard and are reproduced here:</p>
<p class="Q1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page31" title="31"></span>Give the Ascendant and Lord thereof, and Planet from whom the Moon is separated to the Querent or Buyer. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 204)</p>
<p class="Q2">Give the 7th house, the Lord thereof and the Planet to whom the Moon applies to the Seller. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 204)</p>
<p class="Q2">Give the 4th house, the Planet therein placed, and the Moon and Lord of the 4th house to the House, Ground or Manor to be bought or purchased. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 205) [Note that Lilly uses a planet in the 4th house as a signifier of the real estate.]</p>
<p class="Q2">Let the 10th house, a Planet or Planets posited therein, and Lord of that house signify the Price, that is, Whether it will be sold cheap or dear. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 205) [Here Lilly uses planets in the 10th to describe the price, whether it will be high or low.]</p>
