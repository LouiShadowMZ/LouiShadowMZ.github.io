<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-17">SIMMONITE’S GUIDELINES <br/>FOR A THING MISLAID (1851)</p>
<p class="txni">Astrologer W. J. Simmonite (c. 1800–c. 1862) was a British schoolteacher, mathematician, and polyglot who published his first astrological text in the mid-1840s. At some point he <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>cquired Lilly’s text on horary astrology. In 1851, after about twenty years of practicing <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>strology, he published his own book on horary, in which he summarized and simplified much of Lilly’s approach for the nineteenth-century reader. In his preface, Simmonite states (perhaps in contrast to Lilly’s tome): “This small work is unshackled from prolix, conflicting rules and aphorisms. All the rules are founded upon the author’s extensive and experimental practice for twenty years.”</p>
<p class="tx">The following is excerpted from Simmonite’s 1851 text <span class="ital">The Prognostic Astrologer; or, Horary Astrology.</span></p>
<p class="Ahead">Of a Thing Mislaid—How and Where to Find It</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">Consider to whom the thing hidden or mislaid belongs; if the querent, take the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, and I should advise the artist not to answer any but the person who has lost the goods or articles.</p>
<p class="Q2">If the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in any of the four Angles, say it is at home or where the querent suspects, particularly if the Dispositor of the Part of Fortune casts a good aspect to the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> in the Angles.</p>
<p class="Q3">A Fortune [Venus or Jupiter] ascending and having dignities in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>; the Moon in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> in good aspect to the Lord of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>, or [Moon] in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in trine to a planet in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, or [Moon] in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> in trine to its Lord or to the Lord of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>; the Lord of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>; the Luminaries in trine to each other or to the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>; the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> in the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>; the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page98" title="98"></span>joined to its Lord; Jupiter, Venus or the North Node in the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> or the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>; the Lord of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in good aspect to the Lord of the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> or 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, or in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> well dignified; are all signs of its being found again and has been merely lost.</p>
<p class="tx">[Note that, like Lilly (1647), Simmonite (1851) uses aspects involving the <span class="ital">planetary ruler</span> of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house as well as aspects involving the <span class="ital">cusp</span> of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house to determine if the querent’s missing goods will be found.]</p>
<p class="Ahead">The Nature of the Thing Stolen or Missing</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">This is judged by the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> or planets therein.</p>
<p class="Ahead">The Place Where the Lost Thing May Be Found</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">The ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>; then it is in his [or her] hall, shop, dining room; if in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>, where he most frequents or where he put it; if in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, where the maid or wife [spouse, partner] most frequents, or in their rooms; if in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, where his [o<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> her] father or [an] old person most frequents, or in the oldest part of the house.</p>
<p class="Ahead">The Kind of Place Where Things Are</p>
<p class="list2">• [<span class="CharOverride-12">Fire Signs</span>] The ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>, the Moon, or the Part of Fortune, or any two of these which will give the testimony stronger, be in Aries, Leo or Sagittarius, the <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hings lost are near the chimneys, or where iron is laid, in the eaves, or near a wall or upper part of a room;</p>
<p class="list2">• [<span class="CharOverride-12">Air Signs</span>] if in Gemini, Libra or Aquarius, hanging upon a line or trees, or upon high shelves above the ground;</p>
<p class="list2">• [<span class="CharOverride-12">Water Signs</span>] if in Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces, it is in or near some dairy, water-closet, pump, wash-house, moist place, or near water;</p>
<p class="list3">• [<span class="CharOverride-12">Earth Signs</span>] if in Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn, near some pavement or floor, laid on the ground, or under the earth, as in the cellar.</p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">If the significator be going out of one sign into another, the article is behind something, or fallen between two rooms or places, as wainscoting, or niches of boards, or at the joining of two rooms.</p>
<p class="Q2">Notice also the quarter of the house by the sign in which the significators are, according to the points of the compass.</p>

<p class="Ahead">Where Did I Mislay My Watch?</p>
<p class="txni">On Tuesday morning, 15 September 2015, I could not find my watch, which I had taken off the night before. Since I was working on this book, I decided to ask this horary question: “Where did I mislay my watch?” The chart was cast with Regiomontanus houses for 8:51 a.m. EDT at my coordinates 41N17, 73W02 (<a href="HA-12.html">Chart 15</a>). It was a Mars day at the very beginning of a Venus hour.</p>
<p class="tx">The Libra Ascendant makes Venus my significator. Saturn is almuten (the planet with the most essential dignity) of the Ascendant and becomes my co-ruler, along with the Moon, which is co-ruler of the querent in every horary chart.</p>
<p class="tx">Scorpio on the cusp of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house makes Mars the significator of the missing watch.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"></a>Chart 15: Where Is My Watch? <br/>15 September 2015, 8:51 a.m. EDT, 41N17, 73W02. Mars day, Venus hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 15<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 48' Taurus.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page101" title="101"></span>There are multiple testimonies that I will find the watch. Ascendant-ruler Venus (the querent) applies to conjoin Mars (ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>). The Moon (my co-ruler) applies to sextile Mars (the watch). Second-ruler Mars (the watch) applies to square Saturn (my co-ruler as almuten of the Ascendant) in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of my movable goods. Even though this last <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>spect is a square, it occurs in signs of long ascension (Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>nd Sagittarius in the Northern Hemisphere), which Lilly says makes the square act more favorably, as if it were a trine. In his question about purchasing the houses of Master B, Lilly notes that significators connected “though by a Square aspect (yet out of Signs of long ascensions) did much facilitate the matter” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 221).</p>
<p class="Ahead">Where Is the Watch? </p>
<p class="txni">I decided to try Lilly’s method to locate the watch. Lilly believed that the following eight factors gave clues to the whereabouts of the missing item:</p>
<p class="list1">1. <span class="ital">The Sign ascending</span>, its nature, the quarter of Heaven it signifies<span class="ital">—</span>Libra (Air), West, upstairs or the upper part of a room</p>
<p class="list2">2. <span class="ital">Lord of the Ascendant—</span>Venus in <span class="ital">Leo</span> (Fire)—East by North</p>
<p class="list2">3. <span class="ital">Sign of the 4</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">th</span><span class="ital"> house—</span>Capricorn (Earth)—South</p>
<p class="list2">4. <span class="ital">Sign of the Lord of the 4</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">th </span><span class="ital">house—</span>Saturn in Scorpio (Water)—North by East</p>
<p class="list2">5. <span class="ital">Sign of the Moon—</span>Libra (Air)—West</p>
<p class="list2">6. <span class="ital">Sign of the 2</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">nd</span><span class="ital"> house—</span>Scorpio (Water)—North by East</p>
<p class="list2">7. <span class="ital">Sign the Lord of the 2</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">nd</span><span class="ital"> house—</span><span class="roman">M</span>ars in <span class="ital">Leo</span> (Fire)—East by North</p>
<p class="list3">8. <span class="ital">Sign of Part of Fortune—</span>Scorpio (Water)—North by East</p>
<p class="tx">Tallying the results of the primary and secondary compass directions, we get: </p>
<p class="list1">West (2), or by West (0); </p>
<p class="list2">East (2), or by East (3); </p>
<p class="list2">North (3), or by North (2); and </p>
<p class="list3">South (1), or by South (0). </p>
<p class="tx">The preponderance of testimonies suggests that the watch is in the northeast part of the house, perhaps in an upper room (Ascendant in Libra, an Air sign). It may be near a wall, a chimney, or something iron since Mars in Leo (Fire) rules the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp and disposes the Part of Fortune. </p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page102" title="102"></span>Our spare bedroom is upstairs in the northeast corner of the house. I normally keep my watch in this room on a dresser against the outer wall of the house between two windows that have metal screens to keep out insects. It’s the end of summer and we have the windows open to let the fresh air in the house. Along the baseboard beneath the window is a radiator made of iron. </p>
<p class="tx">I go to the spare bedroom and find my watch on the windowsill, obscured by a curtain. The metal bug screen is a couple inches from the watch. It turns out that my wife was putting away some clothes, which she had placed on top of the dresser. To avoid knocking my watch on the floor, she placed it on the windowsill next to the dresser, intending to put the <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>atch back on the dresser when she was done sorting her clothing, but she forgot. </p>
<p class="tx">Based on the 5-degree rule, Mars (the watch) is about to leave the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and is under the influence of the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp, acting as if it were an 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house planet even though it is still in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. Lilly says that when the significator of a missing item is leaving one zodiac <span class="ital">sign</span> and entering the next, the mislaid object is often at the threshold between the two spaces (<span class="ital">CA</span> 203), such as doorways, windows, or partitions. Raphael, quoted earlier in chapter 4 (1877), says: “If the significator be going out of one sign into another, it is behind something, or fallen down between two rooms, or near a door or threshold joining two rooms.” The same guideline appears to apply to the astrological <span class="ital">h</span><span class="ital">ouses</span> of a horary chart. The fact that Mars is about to leave the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (my home, a location where the object normally would be) and enter the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, with Leo on the cusp<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> could place the missing watch behind the curtain on the threshold between my bedroom and the backyard. (Leo can signify outdoor parks and gardens, <span class="ital">CA</span> 95).</p>
<p class="tx">Interestingly, my wife is also represented by Mars (ruler of the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in this chart). Mars's last separation is from a trine to Saturn on August 6, showing her forgetfulness in the matter. Lilly comments: “Behold from whom the Lord of the ascendant did last separate, and if he did separate from Saturn, the cause of the lost thing was through forgetfulness of the owner, who knows not where he laid it, or it is forgotten by reason of some cold or sickness which afflicted the loser, especially if Saturn be Retrograde” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 321). The radical 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp of this chart is my wife’s derived Ascendant. Her Ascendant ruler is Mars, which is last separating from an aspect with Saturn. </p>
<p class="tx">The radical Ascendant-ruler Venus is last separating from a conjunction with Mars. Venus was retrograde at the time of the September 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> conjunction. Lilly says that such a separation from Mars means “it was lost through fear, or some sudden passion, provoking the loser to anger, fury, fire, or for enmity, or upon a quarrel” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 321). Such was not the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page103" title="103"></span>case in this example. Instead, it was misplaced through the mediation of my wife, whose significator is Mars in this horary chart.</p>
<p class="tx">As an aside, I would not have interpreted the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house as a bedroom location, which is usually indicated by the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. In this case, the watch was found in a spare bedroom next to the master bedroom, so perhaps, following the logic of Simmonite, the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> fro<span class="CharOverride-4">m</span> the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> (the radical 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) can represent an extra bedroom in the querent’s house, or perhaps the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> represents the extra bedroom because it is <span class="ital">a place where friends stay</span> when they visit for the weekend.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Via Combusta: Caught in the Scorpion’s Claws, <br/>Dejected and Unable to See Your Way Clearly</p>
<p class="txni">Another interesting feature of this chart is that the Ascendant, the Moon, and the Part of Fortune all lie in the region of the zodiac known since ancient times as the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> (“burnt path,” “scorched way”), which, according to Lilly, is an unlucky region from <span class="ital">15</span><span class="CharOverride-6">o</span><span class="ital"> Libra to 15</span><span class="CharOverride-6">o</span><span class="ital"> Scorpio</span> where the two Luminaries pass through the signs of their “dejection” or “fall,” implying a deprivation of solar and lunar light, with all the symbolic connotations for the querent of such a lack of illumination by the Sun and Moon. According to Lilly, the Sun is exalted (elevated, raised high, or “puffed up,” to use a biblical phrase) in the 19<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> degree of Aries and suffers its fall or depression in the <span class="ital">19</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">th</span><span class="ital"> degree of Libra</span>. Similarly, <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he Moon is exalted or elevated in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> degree of Taurus and lies in its fallen or dejected state in the <span class="ital">3</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">rd</span><span class="ital"> degree of Scorpio</span> (<span class="ital">CA</span> 104). </p>
<p class="tx">Ancient texts give a variety of ranges for the <span class="ital">via combusta</span>, which Lilly equates with <span class="ital">15</span><span class="CharOverride-6">o</span><span class="ital"> Libra to 15</span><span class="CharOverride-6">o</span><span class="ital"> Scorpio, </span>but almost all authorities agree that it encompasses a latter part of Libra and an early part of Scorpio. One source from twelfth-century Egypt states that the burnt way extends from the degree of fall of the Sun to the degree of fall of the Moon, that is, <span class="ital">from the 19</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">th</span><span class="ital"> degree of Libra to the 3</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">rd</span><span class="ital"> degree of Scorpio</span> (Goldstein and Pingree 1979), which is perhaps a minimum range that should be allotted to the <span class="ital">via combusta</span>. Also noteworthy i<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> that in Hellenistic times, the fixed star <span class="ital">Antares</span>, the “heart of the Scorpion,” lay at roughly 15 degrees Scorpio, the very center of the constellation in both the sidereal and tropical zodiacs, so that the claws of the Scorpion encompassed a sizable part of the burnt way.</p>
<p class="tx">Thus, key phrases associated with this “combust” region, where the Luminaries suffer their fall, might include the following: caught in the claws of the Scorpion; feeling restricted, dejected, or oppressed; being deprived of light; not having choice or control in a situation; lacking illumination; being in the dark and unable to see your way clearly; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page104" title="104"></span>being hidden or obscured from view; getting “burnt” (as in the popular idiom); being in the vicinity of fire or combustion; taking a fall; and experiencing misfortune. Given that Lilly titled his text <span class="ital">Christian Astrology,</span> it is possible that his view of the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> is tinged with the Christian myth of Lucifer, the angelic bearer of light, who became so “puffed up” <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>ith his own godlike qualities that the Almighty cast him from Heaven to burn eternally in Hell. Incidentally, <span class="ital">Lucifer</span> is also the Latin name for the planet Venus as a morning star.</p>
<p class="tx">Gadbury, quoted previously in chapter 8, writes that when the “Moon is void of course or in <span class="ital">Via Combusta</span>, the Combust way; All Matters or businesses propounded, go unluckily <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>n: therefore the Astrologer ought to understand the Matter propounded perfectly, or else he will give but poor content to the Querent therein.” </p>
<p class="tx">Astrologer Sue Ward notes that William Lilly paid little attention to the Moon in the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> when analyzing his horary charts. Lilly wrote, perhaps with some skepticism, tha<span class="roman">t “some say” tha</span>t the chart is not safe to judge when the Moon lies in the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> (15° Libra—15° Scorpio), indicating that he may not be in full agreement with this precept. Sue Ward, however, does appear to support the symbolism of the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> as a region associated with restrictive or obstructive influences over which the querent can exercise little choice or control, such as illness, imprisonment, and general hardship.</p>
<p class="tx">The term <span class="ital">via combusta</span> means “fiery road,” “scorched path,” or “burnt way.” Sometimes the symbolism of combustion or burning relates directly to the horary question. For example, the significator of a lost item occupying the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> could mean that the object will be found in a car, with its “combustion” engine. A horary in my files, for example, with the Ascendant in the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> has to do with an adolescent who ran away from home and “burned all bridges” with her family by going to court and legally becoming an “emancipated minor.”</p>
<p class="tx">A prominent <span class="ital">via combusta</span> may also show up in horary charts that involve <span class="ital">a matter that for some reason is being kept hidden, secret, or out of view</span>. This burnt or charred area of <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he zodiac is associated symbolically with <span class="ital">obscurity</span> (darkness, lack of clarity, murkiness)<span class="ital"> </span>and <span class="ital">misfortune</span> (e.g., the bad luck of being scorched or burned), possibly because Libra is the sign of fall of the Sun (which is exalted in Aries) and is also the exaltation of Saturn, whereas the next sign, Scorpio, is the home of Mars and the fall of the Moon (which is exalted in Taurus). Thus, both Luminaries, being in their fall in the <span class="ital">via combusta</span>, have trouble illuminating the way, whereas the malefics Saturn and Mars feel quite free to “do their thing” in this region. </p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page105" title="105"></span>In addition, the autumnal equinox occurs during the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> period—a time (in the Northern Hemisphere) when the Sun begins its decline in power as the days grow shorter and the darkness of night grows longer. The Moon can’t be of much help here because Luna has entered her fall in Scorpio, and thus the forces of evil are free to emerg<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> from darkness. When the cat’s away, the mice will play; here the cat is the light of the Sun and the Moon, and the mice are the malefics Mars and Saturn. Incidentally, Saturn is the traditional ruler of mice, and Mars is the traditional ruler of fire and burning.</p>
<p class="tx">Al-Biruni says of the <span class="ital">via combusta </span>that “the peculiarity however which has given the name <span class="ital">muhtariq </span>[“burnt”] is that the exaltation of Saturn is near, the fall of the Sun being on the one hand and that of the Moon on the other, while the adjacent parts of both signs are occupied by the terms of Mars” (Al-Biruni 1934, 111). </p>
<p class="tx">In the chart of my mislaid watch, the prominence of the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> may refer to the watch being obscured from view by the window shade. The powers of darkness did not allow me to see the missing item. At the same time, the watch lay on the sunny side of the window shade in the “combust” sunlit area of the windowsill. </p>
<p class="tx">In another chart in my files with Gemini rising, the querent (signified by 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span>-ruler Mercury) could not find an ID card that she normally kept in her wallet. The Moon ruled the Regiomontanus 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp (movable possessions) of the horary chart and was posited in early Scorpio in the <span class="ital">via combusta.</span> The Moon (2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler) was about to square the querent’s signifier Mercury, posited in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house (which, like the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, can also signify a place where valuables are stored), in less than a degree of arc, suggesting that she would soon encounter the missing item. The presence of the Moon, ruler of the missing object, in the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> suggested that her ID card was in a dark place, hidden or blocked off from a source of illumination, a description that could fit the inside of he<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> wallet. She was encouraged to again check her wallet, and within an hour she found the missing card there, concealed amidst some paper currency. The misplaced ID was in her black leather wallet all the while, but the prominence of the <span class="ital">via combusta</span> indicated that she could not see that it was there. </p>
