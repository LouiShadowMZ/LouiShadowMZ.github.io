<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-24">PLANETARY KEYWORDS <br/>AND THE LUNAR NODES</p>
<p class="txni">The planets can act as <span class="ital">general significators </span>and thereby also give clues to locations in a horary chart. In this chapter you will find lists of keywords that I have found useful for the seven traditional visible planets, the three “modern” planets, and the asteroid-comet Chiron (which can be useful in missing person charts). Traditional horary astrologers sometimes omit the “modern” planets from their charts. My own view is that the modern planets, even if not used as rulers of signs, provide valuable information and are no less important than the fixed stars, which traditional astrologers do include in their charts.</p>
<p class="tx">It is important to keep in mind that the general significations of the planets, as well as the specific meanings they carry owing to their rulership of house cusps, can provide valuabl<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> clues in finding a lost object. For example, if the significator of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house (one’s possessions) conjoins the planetary ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, the missing item might be found in the trash. Following Lilly’s guidance, Olivia Barclay associates the ruler of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp with specific locations where the missing object, or “hidden treasure,” may be found. Table 11 summarizes some of the suggestions of Barclay, Lilly, and Hali Abenragel (11th century). More detailed significations of each planet can be found in the paragraphs that follow.</p>

<p class="txni">Things that are heavy, hidden, covered, old, or black in color; gravity, austerity, lead, plumbers, coldness, forgetfulness, darkness, scarcity, stagnation, lack, hunger, unemployment, restriction, constriction, obstacles, chains, locks, imprisonment, jails, slowness, old age, the elderly, decay, mourning, blackness, putrefaction, death (especially by water or strangulation), widowhood, morticians, the grave; agricultural instruments, farmers, the land (the earth), serious matters, shrewdness, caution, organizing ability, respected elders, secrets, weighty things, antiques, ancient things, ruins, endings; bones, teeth, leather, skin; loneliness, isolation, fear, shriveling, miserliness, solitude, exile, facing reality, perseverance; squalor, dust, dirt, trash, refuse, stench, dark locations; places undergoing demolition<span class="CharOverride-4">;</span> the soil, agriculture, gardening, farming, stones, miners; things under lock and key. The Dickens character Ebenezer Scrooge embodies many of Saturn’s keywords. </p>
<p class="tx">Saturn is the Greater Malefic. Derek Appleby notes that Saturn conjunct the horary Ascendant or rising in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house, especially when retrograde, suggests that the matter will not end well: “Often some misfortune intervenes to render the original question irrelevant” (Appleby 1985, 15).</p>
<p class="tx-ital"><span class="ital">Saturn rejoices in the 12</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">th</span><span class="ital"> house, “for naturally Saturn is the author of mischief” </span><span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 56).</span></p>
<p class="Ahead">North Lunar Node (Dragon’s Head, Rahu)</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly regards the North Node as benefic and “equivalent to either of the Fortunes [Venus and Jupiter], and when joined with the evil Planets to lessen their malevolent signification; when joined with the good to increase the good promised by them” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 83). Astrologer Al-Biruni, in his <span class="ital">Book of Instruction in the Elements of the Art of Astrology</span> (1027 CE), links the Moon’s nodes with material gain and loss, noting that the Head of the Dragon (North Node) is “hot, auspicious, and indicates increase (of property, etc.). The Tail [South Node] is cold, brings misfortune, and indicates diminution (of wealth, etc.)” (Al-Biruni 1934, 233).<span class="ital"> </span>In the astrology of India, the Moon’s North Node, Rahu, swallows the sun, causing eclipses (a darkening of the light), and the time of day governed by Rahu is considered inauspicious, perhaps in the sense that material gain comes at a spiritual cost. The significator of a missing object near one of the lunar nodes can indicate that it lies in a dark place that does not receive much light.</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page162" title="162"></span>South Lunar Node (Dragon’s Tail, Ketu)</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly regards the South Node as malefic and remarks that in his practice, when the <span class="ital">South Node</span> </p>
<p class="Q4">was joined with the evil Planets, their malice or the evil intended thereby was doubled and trebled, or extremely augmented, &amp;c., and when he chanced to be in conjunction with any of the Fortunes [Venus or Jupiter] who were significators i<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> the question, though the matter by the principal significators was fairly promised, and likely to be perfected in a small time, yet did there ever fall out many rubs and disturbances, much wrangling and great controversy, that the business was many times given over for desperate ’ere a perfect conclusion could be had; and unless the principal significators were Angular and well-fortified with essential dignities, many times unexpectedly the whole matter came to nothing. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 83)</p>
<p class="tx">In the astrology of India, the Moon’s South Node, Ketu, carries with it the idea of spiritual progress, liberation, wisdom, and non-attachment that results from suffering, separa<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ion, dissolution, and loss. The Dragon swallows the life-giving Sun at the North Node, sends it on an unpleasant journey through the reptilian digestive track, and expels the sun excrementally at the South Node. Thus, Ketu (the Dragon’s hind part) is associated with Mars-like separation, severing, and demolition. Such broken relationships are generally experienced as loss and sorrow, but they also carry the potential for necessary release and spiritual transformation. The old, outworn patterns must be dissolved and discarded to make way for renewal. The significator of a missing object near one of the lunar nodes can indicate that the item lies in a dark place that does not receive much light.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Uranu<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> </p>
<p class="txni">Modern gadgets, inventions, technology, inventiveness, electronic devices, diagnostic imaging, eccentric people, astrology, sudden changes, reforms, revolt, rebellion, breaks in the status quo, new methods or circumstances, sudden disruptions, upsets, divorce, reloca<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ion, explosions, accidents, surprising events, abrupt changes in direction, unexpected happenings, and unanticipated events.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Neptune</p>
<p class="txni">Fog, smoke, imagination, films, imagery, things made of glass; drugs, alcohol, intoxication; poets, musicians, photographers, artists, dreamers, mystics; illusion, idealization, evasion, deception (“smoke and mirrors”), scams, bankruptcies, floods, scandal, mystery<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page163" title="163"></span>disillusion, dissolution, lack of purpose, psychological problems, hard-to-diagnose illness, worry, inattention, carelessness, absent-mindedness, confusion, and martyrdom.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Pluto</p>
<p class="txni">Powerful forces beyond the querent’s control, dramatic changes, breakdowns, complications that disrupt the expected course of events, crises, transformative circumstances, matters of life or death, outbreaks of war or disease, extreme measures, intense energy<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> upheaval, radical transformation, life-changing events, rebirth, renovation, recycling<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> remodeling, elimination, waste, coercion; domineering people, the super-rich; lord of the underworld, mortality, passing on to the afterlife. In medical questions, Pluto can signify significant medical and surgical interventions, including radiation and chemotherapy. Pluto involves eliminating what no longer functions to make way for the new and, in doing so, “can destroy prevailing conditions at a stroke and leave a person floundering around completely disorientated” (Appleby 1985, 28). Modern astrologers link the 8th house, Scorpio, and Pluto with elimination, death, and ideas of transformation and rebirth, so the missing object could be in a place undergoing demolition and renovation. If the significator of the missing item is closely aspected by Pluto, it could mean that it somehow got placed in the trash, perhaps in the process of discarding unwanted clutter.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Chiron</p>
<p class="txni">Chiron was discovered on 18 October 1977, orbiting between the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt. It was the first celestial body in our solar system to be classified as a “centaur”—a dual-natured body between Jupiter and Pluto with features common to both asteroids and comets. Additionally, Chiron may be surrounded by rings. In mythology, Chiron was a <span class="CharOverride-4">c</span>entaur and son of Kronos (Saturn). He was an astrologer and an oracle but, above all, <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span> <span class="ital">master of the healing arts</span>. Chiron’s death came about when Heracles inadvertently shot him in the thigh with an arrow poisoned with the blood of the Hydra. Chiron, the great healer, was unable to heal himself. Rather than live for eternity in inconsolable pain and suffering, he chose to surrender his immortal life on Earth and passed into the heavens as the constellation Centaurus. Astrologers today refer to Chiron as the <span class="ital">wounded healer</span>. His myth suggests the following as keywords in horary charts: wounded healer, healing arts, poisoning, a wound that will not heal, inescapable suffering, injury to the thigh, relief from suffering through death, passing on to a higher plane of existence.</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page164" title="164"></span>General Significators: Where Are the Keys?</p>
<p class="txni">When using the associations of signs, houses, and planets to find missing objects, it is important to match the symbolism of the chart to the circumstances of the question. The following chart appeared in a horary astrology group on Facebook. The astrologer, Catriona, kindly gave permission to reproduce it here. On 28 November 2017 at 9:33 a.m. UT in London, her husband asked her to do a chart to find his missing keys (chart 19). Catriona wrote:</p>
<p class="Q4">A funny thing happened this morning with a horary question about Lost Keys. <span class="CharOverride-4">A</span>fter 10 minutes of searching, my husband asked me to look at a chart. I promptly used the astrology app on my phone to check as he walked upstairs in search. It didn’t take long for me to make a judgement and so I started up the stairs to inform him, “The chart says you’ve got them,” I said as we came face to face on the landing. He raised his left hand holding the bunch of keys.</p>
<p class="tx">Ascendant-ruler Jupiter rules the querent (her husband). The 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler, Saturn, rules the missing keys. Saturn will conjoin the Ascendant in 18 minutes of arc. Mercury<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> the general significator of keys, also applies to conjoin the Ascendant, but in 15 minutes of arc; he will get his keys back almost immediately. </p>
<p class="tx">Mercury here also signifies the horary astrologer (Gemini on the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp), so she acts as an intermediary, uniting the keys (2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> ruler Saturn) with the Ascendant (the querent, her husband). In this case, the late degree rising corresponds to the fact that her husband found the keys even before she finished casting the chart.</p>
