<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-46">WHERE IS LISA’S SUIT?</p>
<p class="txni">A friend called from New York City to ask if I could help find her husband’s niece’s suit. Lisa, the niece, lived in upper New York State but occasionally needed to travel back and forth to <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he city on business. My friend offered to let Lisa stay at their apartment when she was in NYC, since their grown son no longer lived with them and there was a spare bedroom.</p>
<p class="tx">Lisa carried her professional clothing back and forth, from home to NYC, to wear to business meetings. She recently noticed that one of her business suits was missing. She thought she had taken it to Manhattan but wasn’t sure. In any case, she could not find th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> suit at her home in upstate New York or in my friend’s NYC apartment.</p>
<p class="tx">My friend asked for astrological help in finding the suit on 18 January 2014 at 8:35 p.m. EST. I happened to be visiting her at the time, so the chart is cast for her location in New York City (<a href="HA-41.html">Chart 45</a>).</p>
<p class="tx">It is a Saturn day during a Jupiter hour.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="CharOverride-4">I</span>n this case we must use derived houses, because the missing item belongs to the daughter of the sister of the husband of the querent.</p>
<p class="tx">The querent is signified by the Ascendant, and her husband, by the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. The husband’s sister is the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> from the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, or the radical 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>. The husband’s sister’s daughter is the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> from the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, or the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> of the radical chart. Interestingly, we have come full circle, and the Virgo Ascendant, ruled by Mercury, signifies both the querent and her husband’s sis<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>er’s daughter Lisa. </p>
<p class="tx">The missing suit is therefore ruled by the radical 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, with Libra on the cusp and Mars in Libra within. Venus is the primary ruler of the suit, and Mars is a possible co-ruler.</p>
<p class="tx">Mercury (Lisa) applies to trine Mars in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house. This is an indication that she will find the suit. Mercury (Lisa) does not aspect 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>-ruler Venus.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"></a>Chart 45: Lisa’s Missing Suit <br/>18 January 2014, 8:35 p.m. EST, New York City. Saturn day, Jupiter hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 2<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 12' Aquarius.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page305" title="305"></span>Lisa’s co-ruler Moon, however, trines Venus in about 16 degrees. This Moon-Venus trine is mutually applying, because 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>-ruler Venus is retrograde, another indication that <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he missing item will be found. However, the trine takes place from the Moon in a mutable sign in a cadent house to Venus in a cardinal sign in a succedent house, so the timing could be 16 weeks or 16 months. With Venus retrograde and moving toward the approaching Moon, 16 weeks seemed more likely.</p>
<p class="tx">Venus in Capricorn suggests a dark place. Venus on the cusp of the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house made me think it might be in a child’s room, and in fact Lisa was staying in my friend’s son’s room, which he no longer used. The location on the cusp suggested it might be near a boundary or doorway that separated the child’s room from a hallway or other room. Venus lying under the sunbeams suggested that the suit was somehow hidden or obscured from view.</p>
<p class="tx">Because the Moon is traveling at a slower than average rate and because Venus lies on the cusp of the succedent 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, I thought it would take some time to locate the missing item. The succedent placement of Venus also suggested that it might not be in my friend’s apartment, but I was certain the suit would be found.</p>
<p class="tx">Nonetheless, repeated searches of the apartment did not turn up the missing clothing. About four months later, my friend called to say that they had finally found the suit. It was in her son’s closet and had been obscured by being sandwiched between other pieces of clothing. Even though my friend had looked in the closet several times prior to finding it, she simply did not see it (as symbolized by Venus under the Sun’s beams).</p>
