<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-16">LILLY: HOW TO FIND <br/>A THING HID OR MISLAID</p>
<p class="txni">Horary astrologers are frequently asked to locate lost or missing items. This chapter presents William Lilly’s approach to finding things hidden or mislaid. The quotations from Lilly come from chapter XXXII of <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span> (pages 202–204) regarding the 4th house, which is traditionally associated with buried treasure and hidden valuables.</p>
<p class="Q1"><span class="med">Of the FOURTH House, and the Judgment depending thereupon.</span></p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">This is the House of Parents, of Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments, Cities, Towns, Villages, Farms, Manors, Castles, Treasure-trove, or of anything hid in the ground<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> &amp;c.</p>
<p class="Ahead">To Find a Thing Hid or Mislaid </p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">Be careful to take your Ascendant exactly, and consider the nature of the Question, viz. whose Goods, or to whom the thing missing, or lost, or enquired after did appertain; if the Goods be the Querent’s own Commodity, then see to the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span>; if it belong to the Brother or Sister, then have regard to the Lord of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>; if to the Father, the Lord of the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>; if to the Mother, the Lord of the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, &amp;c. and so in order, according to the nature of the Party who proposes the Question.</p>
<p class="Q2">If you find the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> in any Angle, you may judge the thing lost, hid or missing, is within the house of him that demands the Question; and if the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in the Ascendant, or in the Sign wherein the Lord of the Ascendant is, or in on<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> of his houses, you may judge the thing is in that part of the house which he himself most frequents, or wherein he does most abide, or is conversant, or where he lays his own Commodities, or such things as he most delights in; but if the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, it’s then in his Shop, if he be a Mechanic; if a Gentleman, in his Hall or Dining-room; if a Husband-man, in the ordinary common room of his house, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page94" title="94"></span>first room after entrance into his house: If the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, it’s in that part of the house where his Wife, or his Maid-servants have most to do in:</p>
<p class="Q2">If the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, it’s where the most aged of the house doth lodge, or formerly did most frequent, or in the middle of the house, or in the most ancient part of the house, where either his Father or some ancient man lodged: The nature and quality of the place is known by the Signs the Significators are in; for if the Sign of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be airy, or the greater number of the Significators and Sign wherein Part of Fortune is, do concur, the thing is his in the Eaves or top, or upper part of that house or room where it is, or on high from the ground: and if the thing hid be in the Field, or in a Garden or Orchard, it’s higher than the ordinary ground, or upon the highest hill or part of that ground, or hangs upon some stalk of a Plant <span class="CharOverride-4">o</span>r Tree.</p>
<p class="Q2">If the former Significators be strong, and in watery Signs, it’s in the Buttery, Dairy or Wash house, or near Water.</p>
<p class="Q2">If in fiery Signs, it’s near the Chimney, or where Iron is, or in, or near the Walls of the house.</p>
<p class="Q2">If in earthly Sign, the thing hid is on the ground or earth, under or near some Pavement or Floor, and if you find the thing to be mislaid out of the house in any ground, it notes near the Bridge or Stile where people come into the ground.</p>
<p class="Q2">If your Significator be going out of one Sign and entering another, the thing is behind something or other, or is carelessly fallen down betwixt two rooms, or near the Threshold, or joining together of two rooms, and is higher or lower in the place, according to the nature of the Sign, &amp;c. </p>
<p class="Ahead">What Part of the House or Ground </p>
<p class="Q1-nsa">The Ancients have delivered many rules, and do say, that to judge in what part of the house or ground the thing is in, you must see to the Lord of the hour, and if he be in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house or 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, you may say the thing is in the South part of the house, towards the East; and if he be between the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and Ascendant, then North-east: if he be between the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, then North-west; If between the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, then Southwest.</p>
<p class="Q2">This is and was the opinion of the former Astrologians, however, I have not found this judgment very exact, therefore I labored to find a more certain manner, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page95" title="95"></span>and a more exact way for the ready discovery or finding out anything mislaid or missing in the house, and not stolen: and it was thus:</p>
<p class="Q2">1. First, I considered the Sign ascending, its nature, the quarter of Heaven it signified.</p>
<p class="Q2">2. Secondly, what Sign the Lord of the Ascendant was in.</p>
<p class="Q2">3. The Sign of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house.</p>
<p class="Q2">4. The Sign the Lord of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> was in.</p>
<p class="Q2">5. What Sign the Moon was in.</p>
<p class="Q2">6. The Sign of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house.</p>
<p class="Q2">7. The Sign the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> was in.</p>
<p class="Q2">8. The Sign Part of Fortune was in.</p>
<p class="Q2">I considered the quality of the Signe, as to shew what part of the house it was in; I mean, what quarter, whether East, West, North or South, according to the greater number of testimonies: and you must know, for things lost, mislaid, or fugitives, there are the true quarters of Heaven the Signs signify.</p>
