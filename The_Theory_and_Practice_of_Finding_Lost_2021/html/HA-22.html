<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-27">WHERE IS THE MISSING PADLOCK?</p>
<p class="txni">My wife and I were visiting friends at their country home near Port Jervis, New York. At about 10 a.m., my friend was looking for a padlock he had recently purchased. He was sure he had brought it home but was unable to find it, even after searching carefully in all the places he might have put it. His wife asked me to do a horary chart to locate their missing padlock. The question was asked at 10:02 a.m. EDT on 24 June 2012, 41N23, 74W42 (chart 21). It was a Sun day during a Moon hour. The chart was cast with Placidus houses, which I happened to be using at the time to study some solar returns.</p>
<p class="tx">I took a quick look at the chart and said that the missing padlock should be in a drawer or cabinet in the kitchen near a boundary with the bedroom. There is, in fact, a dresser in the kitchen near the hallway that leads to the bedroom in the country home. My friend said <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hat the dresser was a logical place to look, but he had already searched there and could not find the padlock. His wife then looked carefully through the top drawer and, lo and behold, <span class="CharOverride-4">f</span>ound the padlock under a multitude of other tools and odd bits and pieces of stuff. </p>
<p class="tx">My reasoning was as follows. The querent’s possessions are ruled by the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, which has a Virgo cusp in this chart. Virgo often represents places that are organized and compartmentalized, like cabinets and dressers with their drawers. Mercury, the ruler of Virgo, lies in Cancer, which is associated with food, nurturing, and kitchens. Mercury is also near the cusp of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which often symbolizes bedrooms in horary. Mercury is also at the end of Cancer and is about to leave the sign, suggesting that the missing item may be near an exit from the kitchen (symbolized by Cancer). The planet Mars represents iron, and its appearance in compartmentalizing Virgo in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house seems to describe the missing item, a padlock made of steel.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"></a>Chart 21: Where Is the Missing Padlock?<br/>24 June 2012, 10:02 a.m. EDT, 41N23, 74W42. Sun day, Moon hour. <br/>Placidus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 3<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 12' Cancer. Late degree rising.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page185" title="185"></span>Looking at the symbolism in the chart and then looking around the kitchen, I thought that the dresser in the kitchen near the hallway to the bedroom was the most likely loca<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ion. The dresser has two drawers above a cupboard-like compartment. I therefore said I <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>hought the lock was in one of the two drawers, probably the one closer to the bedroom, which is where his wife found it.</p>
<p class="tx">To help determine the location of a missing object, Olivia Barclay suggests looking at the planet that rules the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house and also the sign in which the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ruler resides (Barclay 1990, 184). Here Mars rules the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp, and Mars lies in Virgo in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of the querent’s possessions. According to Barclay, if the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ruler is Mars, then the missing item will be in the kitchen or near fire; and if the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ruler lies in Virgo, the item will be found in a study or a cupboard.</p>
