<p class="txni">In the very first issue of <span class="ital">The Horary Practitioner</span> (April 1989), astrologer C. J. Puotinen, D.F.Astrol.S., presented an article entitled “Lost &amp; Found: The Basic Rules.” Because this journal is out of print and may be hard to find, I will summarize here some of the highlights from her article with direct quotes:</p>
<p class="list1">• Identify the significators. “Before you can find something lost, you have to define exactly what it is so you can know what significators to use.” (p. 5)</p>
<p class="list2">• The chart must describe the situation. “The charts that work best are those that describe the situation accurately.” (p. 6)</p>
<p class="list2">• Signifiers of the missing object. “In addition to being shown by the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> ruler, a missing item is represented by the Moon and the ruler of the planetary hour. … If the significator is in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house, or in the same sign as the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> ruler, or in a sign ruled by the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> ruler, the missing thing is with the querent or in the part of the querent’s hous<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> that he uses most often, or where he keeps his own possession or favorite things.” (p. 8) [A similar principle applies to the other angular houses. For example, the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> can signify one’s office or workspace; the 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, where the partner spends a lot of time; and the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, the oldest part of the house or where an older person spends time; and so on.]</p>
<p class="list2">• The significator in a very early or late degree. “If the significator is at the very end or beginning of a sign, the missing item may be near a door or entryway, or between two rooms, or it may have fallen behind something.” (p. 9)</p>
<p class="list2">• Significators in the same quadrant of the chart. “If the Moon is in the same quadrant as the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> ruler and there is less than one sign (30<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span>) between them, the lost thing is in or about the house of the person who lost it. If they are separated by 30<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span>–70<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span>, it is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page34" title="34"></span>nearby or in the owner’s town. If they are not in the same quadrant, it is far from the owner.” (p. 9)</p>
<p class="list2">• Most recent aspect of the Ascendant ruler. “The planet from which the significator of the person who lost it separates may describe what happened.” (p. 10)</p>
<p class="list2">• Non-recovery. “The chief signs of no recovery are Saturn, Mars or the South Lunar Node in the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house, the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> ruler in the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house or combust, or the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> ruler applying to the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> ruler with any aspect.” (p. 13)</p>
