<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-49">LILLY: APHORISMS AND <br/>CONSIDERATIONS FOR BETTER <br/>JUDGING ANY HORARY QUESTION</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly apparently thought the following aphorisms had enough value in his practice that he included them prominently in his text (<span class="ital">CA</span> 298–302). As with all aphorisms, they are general guidelines rather than infallible truths. </p>
<p class="Q1"> 1. See the Question be radical, or fit to be judged; which is, when the Lord of the Ascendant and hour be of one nature or Triplicity.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"> 2. Be not confident of the Judgment if either the 1st degrees or later of any Sign be ascending; if the later degrees arise, the matter of the Question is elapsed, and it’s probable the Querent hath been tampering with others, or despairs of <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>ny success; however, the Heavens advise you not to meddle with it at that time.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"> 3. The position of Saturn or Mars in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, and they peregrine or unfortunate, or the South Node in that house, the Artist hardly get credit by that Question.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"> 4. Judge not upon every slight motion, or without premeditation of the Querent, nor upon slight and trivial Questions, or when the Querent hath not with to know what he would demand.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"> 5. Have special regard to the strength and debility of the Moon, and it’s far better the Lord of the Ascendant be unfortunate then she, for she brings unto us the strength and virtue of all the other Planets, and of one Planet to another.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"> 6. Behold the condition of Saturn in every Question, he is naturally ill by his excess of cold; Mars is of ill influence, because of his too much heat: in very truth, neither of them is cold or dry, but signify so much in their virtue and operation, and therefore in all Questions they shew tardity and detriment in the Question<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page324" title="324"></span>unless the Moon and they receive each other in the Signification. [Note: <span class="ital">Tardity</span> means slowness, sluggishness, or tardiness.]</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"> 7. See the condition of Jupiter and Venus be observed, who naturally are Fortunes and temperate, and never import any malice, unless by accident: where they <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>re Significators without reception, they put forward the matter, but they best preform the matter in question when they apply by Trine or Sextile, and to pur<span class="CharOverride-4">p</span>ose when in Essential Dignities.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"> 8. In every Question where Fortunes are Significators, hope well; but in Infortunes, then fear the worst, and accordingly order your business.</p>
<p class="list3-right-indent"> 9. Generally consider the state of the Moon, for if she be void of course there’s no great hopes of the Question propounded, that it shall be effected; yet if she be in Cancer, Taurus, Sagittarius or Pisces, your fear may be less, for then she is not much impedited by being void of course. </p>
<p class="tx">[Note: Lilly viewed <span class="ital">void of course</span> as describing a situation in which a planet at any point within a sign was not applying within orb to a major aspect with another visible planet. Orbs of aspects were determined by adding the moieties (half-orbs) of the two planets involved in the aspect. See <span class="ital">CA</span> 112 for his definition.]</p>
<p class="Q1">10. See from what Planet the Moon is separated, that Planet shows what has already been done: if from a Fortune good; if from a malevolent, ill; according to the nature of the house, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">11. The Application of the Moon shows the present condition of the thing demanded, viz. her applying by a good aspect, and in a good house, to a good Planet, intimates the strong hopes of the thing intended.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">12. The Application of the Moon to a Planet in his Fall, signifies anguish, trouble and delays in the thing demanded.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">13. A Retrograde Planet, or one in his first station, Significator in Question, denotes ill in the Question, discord and much contradiction.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">14. We ought warily to consider if evil Planets be Significators in anything, for if they predict evil in the thing quesited, the vengeance is more heavy; if they foretell of any good, it’s less than what is expected, it’s imperfect, and nothing therein comes, without infinite solicitation and affliction, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page325" title="325"></span>15. A Planet that is slow in motion, prolongs the thing quesited after, so that it’s hardly performed; the nature of the Sign wherein the Planet is, doth herein much advantage the judgment.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">16. When Infortunes are Significators of any evil, do you well consider if the Fortunes, viz. Jupiter of Venus, cast not any aspect unto them, then the evil intended formerly is lessened; do so when the Fortunes are Significators.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">17. If the Fortunes signify any thing, and are cadent, or ill placed in Dignities, or behold not the Ascendant, or are Retrograde, then are they impedited, and shall perform little, if not received.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">18. Notwithstanding Reception, if he be an Infortune, he perform but little; but if the same happen when the Fortunes are Significators, the thing is perfected.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">19. A Planet Peregrine, viz. having no essential Dignities where he is, he is malicious beyond expression; if he be in essential Dignities, the less; for then he is like a noble soul that hath his enemy in his clutches, but scorns to hurt him.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">20. And yet generally, if Saturn or Mars be in House, Exaltation, Triplicity and Angles, and then have Signification in a Question, they perform the thing desired.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">21. Confide not too much in the assistance a Fortune lends, unless he be in essential Dignities; for then he perform matters wholly, else but by halves.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">22. When in a Question wherein both the Fortunes and Infortunes are either weak or equally ill placed, promise no success upon that demand; defer the Judgment until the Heavens have a better Position.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">23. Beware in all Judgments, when the Significator of the question is either Combust, or in Opposition to the Sun, he will then signify nothing of the matter, no good, nor is he able to bring anything to perfection.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">24. One Infortune joined to another, if good be signified by their aspect, yet will it have no effect, or come to any thing: If they signify evil, it’s probably that it may fall out with more malice than expected.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">25. The Lord of the Ascendant out of his essential Dignities, Cadent, &amp;c., shows the Querent is out of all hopes in his business.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">26. A Planet within 12 degrees of the Sun, is said to be under his Beams, and then hath not fortitude, let it be in what Sign it will; when a Planet is within 16 mi<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span>utes of the Sun, he is said to be in Cazimi, or heart of the Sun, and then it’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page326" title="326"></span>a<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> addition of fortune, and he is wondrous strong. [Page 300 of <span class="ital">Christian Astrology</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>ppears to have a typo, so here I corrected Lilly’s 1674 text from “heat of the Sun” to “heart of the Sun.”]</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">27. See to what Planet the Significator commits his disposition, and if Oriental or Occidental; if it be to Saturn, Jupiter or Mars, and they Oriental, the matter is sooner performed; later, if Occidental, do the contrary in Venus and Mercury.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">28. Observe if the Planet that is Significator of the thing desired, be in a fixed Signe, moveable [cardinal], or common [mutable]: fixed Signs shew stability, and that the thing shall continue, whether it be begun, or is to be begun: common [mutable] Signs shew the oft probability of perfecting the thing, and yet not its conclusion: moveable [cardinal] Signs shew a sudden resolution or conclusion of the matter one way or other. From hence we being Foundations of Houses and Towns when Significators are fixed; short Journey when they are moveable: but in things wherein we define mediocrity, we elect common Signs.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">29. The Lord of the Ascendant or the Moon with the Head or Tail of the Dragon [the Moon’s nodes], brings damage to the Question propounded; see in what house they are in, and receive signification from thence.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">30. Look whether the degree of the Ascendant, or place of the Sign the Significator is in, be the then place of any Eclipse at hand; though the matter propounded be in a fair way to be concluded, yet shall it insensibly receive prejudice when least is expected, and hardly be concluded.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">31. If you find the Moon impedited in any Question, be it what it will, there will be the like stay, demur or hindrance in the thing quesited; and indeed there’s seldom good end comes of the Question where the Moon is impedited; if it be in going to War, you may fear the life of the Querent; if in a Journey, ill success, if Marriage, an ill end of Wooing, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">32. If the Lord of the question or the Moon be in a Sign opposite to his own house, as Mercury in Sagittarius or Pisces, &amp;c., the Querent hath no good hopes of his demands, he despairs, nor doth he delight in it, nor doth he care whether it can be performed or not.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">33. Consider diligently the Planet impediting the Signifier of the thing demanded, and what house he is either Lord of, or is posited in; from the nature or person of that house require the cause obstructing.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page327" title="327"></span>34. The nearer your Significator is to an Angle, the more good you may expect; less, if placed in a Succedent house; little if in a Cadent.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">35. In all Questions, know there’s not so great an affliction to the Moon, as when she is in Conjunction with the Sun; the ill aspects of the Infortunes do much afflict her, but none so powerful as her Combustion.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">36. In any Question, see if an Infortune aspect your Significator, and whether they be both Peregrine, Retrograde, Cadent, or in Signs contrary to their own nature, it may then be doubted they infer such a mischief in the question, as is inevitable, according to natural causes.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">37. Planets that are Significators in anything, if they are in Conjunction, and in a Sign agreeing to their own nature, then the thing quesited after is brought to perfection with much ease and facility, else not.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">38. Have special regard to the Significators, and whether any frustration or prohibition be before the perfect aspect: the Planet frustrating describes the party or cause hindering the matter demanded.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">39. Ever consider the Part of Fortune, which if well dignified in any house, the Querent gets by men, or things denoted by that house; and so, if ill dignified, damage from thence.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">40. In questions of Marriage, an unfortunate Planet in the 7th threatens ill agreement in Marriage, unless the same Planet be a Significator at the Birth.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">41. If the Lord of the 8th be impedited or unfortunate in the 8th, the Querent shall receive prejudice by the death of some woman, or concerning some debts due unto him from men deceased.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">42. In what house you find Jupiter and Venus well dignified, you may expect benefit from such men and things as are Signified by that house; as if in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span>, from Kindred; in the 4th, from Father, or by Lands, &amp;c. in the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> by Play, &amp;c. and so in other houses.</p>
<p class="list2-right-indent">43. Beware of men and things appertaining to that house wherein South Node is in; it seldom fails, but the Querent shall receive damage, scandal or slander from men and matter signified by the house he is in.</p>
