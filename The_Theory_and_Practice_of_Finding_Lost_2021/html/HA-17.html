<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-22">THE TWELVE SIGNS AND <br/>ASSOCIATED PHYSICAL LOCATIONS</p>
<p class="txni">The literature suggests several physical locations that are associated with each sign of the zodiac. Rather than take these keywords literally, it is best to let the associations trigger your intuition and stimulate your imagination. Certain general principles apply; for example, Lilly says that if the <span class="ital">Lord of the 4</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">th</span> (signifying the location of hidden things) lies “in a movable [cardinal] sign, it is in a high place; if in a fixed sign, it is on the earth [ground level]; in a common [mutable] sign, it is in a covered place” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 352). As you gain experience with horary, you will no doubt modify the following information based on the outcomes of your horary charts.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Significator Near a Cusp of a House or Sign</p>
<p class="txni">An important condition relates to the significator of a missing object being at or very close to the cusp, or border, between houses or signs. Lilly writes:</p>
<p class="Q4">If your Significator be going out of one Sign and entering another, the thing is behind something or other, or is carelessly fallen down betwixt two rooms, or near the Threshold, or joining together of two rooms, and is higher or lower in the place, according to the nature of the Sign, &amp;c. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 203)</p>
<p class="tx">The key points Lilly makes are that if the significator of the missing item lies at the end of a sign, then the following possibilities should be considered:</p>
<p class="list1">• The querent wasn’t being careful and may have inadvertently dropped the item.</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="CharOverride-4">•</span> The missing item may have fallen (e.g., from the querent, or from a container it was in) due to carelessness or inattention.</p>
<p class="list2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page136" title="136"></span>• The item may have fallen behind or beneath something, which obscures its being seen.</p>
<p class="list2">• The item may be near a threshold, door, window, or point of entry to the room (for example, hanging from a doorknob); near the place where two rooms or spaces meet; or near the passage between two rooms.</p>
<p class="list2">• The element of the sign containing the significator suggests how high or low the item is; Fire and Air imply higher locations, while Earth and Water suggest places lower down or on the floor.</p>
<p class="list2">• The significator of the missing object being near the boundary between <span class="ital">zodiacal signs</span> can mean that the item is near a wall, door, or partition, or that it has been moved (or is being moved) from one location to another. A similar condition holds if the significator lies close to the boundary between two astrological <span class="ital">houses</span> or is situated within five degrees from the cusp of the next house. In either case, the object may be found near a door, gate, window, or border between rooms.</p>
<p class="Ahead">My Failure to Find the Missing Antique Book</p>
<p class="txni">The following example illustrates the usefulness of paying attention to the boundaries between houses. An astrological colleague asked me to review one of his horary charts. He works with antiques and was having trouble locating a valuable book that he needed to return to its owner. Unfortunately, he was unable to find the book despite a careful search of his house, which he works from, so he cast a horary chart on 27 November 2016. He was sure that the book was in his home and that he had put it in a place for safekeeping and then forgot its location. He wrote:</p>
<p class="Q4">I had somehow thought to hide it before leaving on a business trip and completely forgot what I had done with it.</p>
<p class="tx">I did my best to analyze the chart and to suggest places <span class="ital">in his home</span> where the book might be found. Despite our joint efforts, he had no luck in locating the missing item. I felt bad that I was unable to be of more help. The mystery was solved about three months later, as he explained in an email in mid-March of 2017:</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"></a>Chart 16: Where Is the Missing Antique Book? <br/>27 November 2016, 1:33 p.m. EST, 42N22, 71W12. Sun day, Venus hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 4<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 12' Cancer.</p>
<p class="Q4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page138" title="138"></span>It turned out that my car received a death sentence for mechanical failure a couple of weeks back. I immediately purchased another and began clearing out stuff in th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> trunk of my old car, where I found the book lodged in the rear, up against the back seats. It was slightly askew, with some minor damage that I was able to fix. The date must have been Monday, February 27. The book was accidentally displaced from a box when I was exhibiting at a conference in Washington, DC, and never left the car, whereas I had assumed and was completely convinced that I had hidden i<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> somewhere in the house before I left. You unfortunately received the wrong info from me when I contacted you about it. </p>
<p class="tx">Here is the chart that my astrologer colleague cast for his question on 27 November 2016 at about 1:33 p.m. EST in the Boston area (chart 16).</p>
<p class="tx">The 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part (dodecatemorion) of the Ascendant lies at 4<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 12' Cancer at the cusp of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, suggesting that he is concerned about 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house matters and very old things—in this case, the antique book, which is part of our cultural heritage. The ruler of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, the Moon, conjoins the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp, revealing his anxiety that the book may be lost and gone forever. Interestingly, in Jyotish, the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house also rules our cars or vehicles, but this association did not occur to me at the time.</p>
<p class="tx">The question was asked on a Sun day during a Venus hour. The Ascendant-ruler Mars and the hour-ruler Venus are both of the Earth and Water triplicities.</p>
<p class="tx">Ascendant-ruler Mars signifies the querent, as does the Moon as his co-ruler.</p>
<p class="tx">The 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler, Venus, is the primary signifier of the missing book. Other possible signifiers include the Moon (general signifier of wandering things and exalted ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house), Jupiter (dispositor of the Part of Fortune), Mercury (general signifier of books), and Saturn (general signifier of very old things).</p>
<p class="tx">Will he find the book? Yes, because of the following:</p>
<p class="list1">• Mars (the querent) applies to trine Jupiter in about 2.5 degrees (equivalent to 2.5 months), and Jupiter rules the cusp of the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which can signify books. </p>
<p class="list2">• Moon (the querent) applies to sextile 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler Venus in about 1.5 degrees (equivalent to 1.5 months).</p>
<p class="list3">• Thus, he should find the book within 1.5 to 2.5 months, because the applying planets are in fixed signs and succedent houses.</p>
<p class="tx">Where is the book? My initial suggestions were not helpful because I assumed the book was in the querent’s house. In hindsight, we can see that 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house ruler Venus (the book) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page139" title="139"></span>is changing from the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> to the 11<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, that is, from a place where he does business to a location related to the resources needed to conduct his business. The Moon (the book, co-ruler of the querent, and ruler of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>) is moving from the angular 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> to the hidden 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>. The significators being at the boundaries between houses suggests that the book may have fallen to a location between rooms or at the joining of two enclosed spaces and is most likely behind something, so that it cannot be seen. </p>
<p class="tx">The presence of Mercury (books) in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house suggests that the book may have gone on a long-distance trip (from Boston to Washington, DC). Mercury is separating from a conjunction with Saturn (antiques, falls) after having formed a sextile to Jupiter, which rules the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of travel: the antique book (Mercury conjunct Saturn) went on a trip and fell down. In addition, Mercury rules the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of local transport, so there is a link between the book and the querent’s car. It’s much easier to analyze charts in hindsight.</p>
<p class="tx">In retrospect, I also see that Mars will sextile Saturn in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house after having trined 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> lord Jupiter. Because Saturn is a general signifier of old things, it could represent the antique book, and its placement in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house could mean that the book went on a trip. Studying the outcomes of horary charts, especially when we got the wrong answer, is an extremely valuable learning experience.</p>
<p class="tx">This chart reminds me of a comment by John Frawley (<span class="ital">The Horary Textbook</span>, 2014, 173) that in his experience, <span class="ital">missing items are</span> <span class="ital">commonly found in a place that the querent insists they couldn’t possibly be located</span>, or otherwise they are with the querent’s spouse or child. This example is also evidence of the usefulness of Frawley’s dictum: “If there is a planet in the chart that exactly describes the object, use that, even if it doesn’t rule the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> or the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house” (170). Here, Mercury conjunct Saturn in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house describes an antique book that recently went on a long-distance trip to another state.</p>
