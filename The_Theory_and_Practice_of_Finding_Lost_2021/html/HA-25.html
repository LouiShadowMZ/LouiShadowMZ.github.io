<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-30">LILLY: WHERE IS THE ABSENT BROTHER?</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly writes about a querent who wanted to know whether his absent brother was dead or alive: </p>
<p class="Q1">In November of 1645, a Citizen of London being gone into the West of England, and no news for many weeks had where he was, his own Brother with great importunity moved me to give my judgment concerning these particulars:</p>
<p class="Q2 ParaOverride-9">1. If living or dead? if dead, whether killed by soldiers? for at this time our miserable kingdom was full of soldiery.</p>
<p class="Q2">2. If living, when he should hear of him? And where he was?</p>
<p class="Q2">3. When he would come home?</p>
<p class="Q4">The Ascendant doth here represent the shape and form of him that asked the Question, with consideration had to Saturn, Lord of the Sign; and as both the Sign ascending and Lord thereof are of a dry quality and nature, so was the Querent, lean, spare of body, and a real Saturnine man, &amp;c. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 196–197)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Lilly begins by making sure the chart is radical and fit to judge. The Ascendant accurately describes the querent, so it looks like a valid chart (<a href="HA-25.html">Chart 24</a>). Lilly did not mention the fact that it is a Venus day during a Mars hour, nor did he work with <span class="ital">dwads</span> (12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> parts). In this chart, the <span class="ital">dwad</span> of the Ascendant lies in Virgo—the sign on the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp—which is fitting, as the querent is concerned about the possibility that his missing brother might be dead. In addition, the ruler of the Virgo <span class="ital">dwad</span> is Mercury, which occupies the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of long-distance travel and foreign lands.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"></a>Chart 24: Lilly: Absent Brother<br/>17 November 1645, 11:42:49 a.m. LMT, London. Venus day, Mars hour. <br/>True nodes. (Lilly used mean nodes.) Regiomontanus houses. <br/>Dwad of Ascendant is at 5° 24' Virgo.</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page203" title="203"></span>Taurus is the Ascendant of the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> House, and Venus being Lady of the sign, did represent the absent Brother, or party inquired after: the Moon in regard she neither applied to one significator or other, had not much to do in this Question, I mean in description of the parties. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 197)</span></p>
<p class="tx">The querent’s brother is shown by the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house, with Taurus on the cusp, making Venus the missing brother’s significator. The cusp of the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> becomes the brother’s derived Ascendant. Lilly explains that he is not using the Moon in this chart to describe the querent or his brother because the Moon does not form an applying aspect to the significator of either party.</p>
<p class="Q4">For as much as Venus, significatrix of the Quesited, is no manner of way afflicted either by Mercury who is Lord of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> in the figure, or by Mars who is Lor<span class="CharOverride-4">d</span> of the eighth as to the ascendant of the quesited, and that the separation of the Moon was good, viz., from a dexter trine of Jupiter, and her next application to a conjunction of the Sun, upon the Cusp of the Medium Coeli, I judged the absent Brother was alive and had no manner of casualty happened unto him, but was in good health. Having judged the man to be alive there needs no proceeding to judgment of the rest of the first Query. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 197)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Lilly identifies the Lords of Death, of which there are two in this chart: the ruler of the radical 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death and the ruler of the brother’s derived house of death, which is the 8th from the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span>, or the radical 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>. Virgo on the cusp of the radical 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> makes Mercury a ruler of death for the querent, and Scorpio on the cusp of the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> identifies Mars as a ruler of death of the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span>-house brother. Either ruler of death is capable of killing the <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>bsent brother, but the good news is that neither significator of death afflicts the brother’s ruler Venus. Some astrologers might argue that only the ruler of the brother’s derived 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house would indicate his death, but Lilly accepts the querent’s 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ruler of death as a potential killer as well.</p>

<p class="tx">Lilly then turns his attention to the Moon, which is <span class="ital">a general signifier of fugitives</span> and a mediator of the action of the other planets in the chart. He notes that the Moon has sep<span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>rated from a favorable trine with Jupiter (<a href="HA-25.html">Table 12</a>). Separating aspects have perfected in the past and indicate what happened prior to the horary question. Benefic Jupiter in Cancer is in its exaltation, making its trine even more favorable. The Moon has also previously conjoined Mercury, which is rather weak, being peregrine (without any essential dignity) and occupying the cadent 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. </p>
<p class="tx">The next aspect to be formed by the Moon will be a conjunction with the Sun at the Midheaven. Lilly feels that the future aspect to which the Moon is applying within orb confirms his judgment that the brother is alive and also indicates that nothing bad has happened to him in the recent past (Moon trine Jupiter) and that he is in good health (Moon applying to conjoin the Sun, a general signifier of vitality). </p>
<p class="tx">Lilly ignores the Moon’s final aspect, a conjunction with Mars at the very end of Scorpio, probably because Mars (the brother’s derived 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house ruler of death) is not within orb of the Moon at the time of the question. (See <a href="HA-25.html">Table 13</a> for the orbs used by Lilly in the seventeenth century and those used by Iranian astrologer Al-Biruni in the eleventh century. Astrologers should feel free to experiment with either set of orbs in their horary prac<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ice.) Here is the math. Lilly gives the Moon an orb of 12.5 degrees, and he gives Mars an orb of 7.5 degrees. To judge whether the aspect is within orb, you add the orb of the Moo<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> to that of Mars and divide by 2: 12.5 (Moon) + 7.5 (Mars) = 20 degrees, which divided by 2 is 10 degrees, which represents the maximum distance that planets can be separated to be within orb of the aspect. In this chart, Mars at 29<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Scorpio 06' is more than 13 degrees away from the Moon at 15<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 52' Scorpio, and thus the conjunction is not within orb.</p>

<p class="tx">The Moon’s conjunction with the Sun is within orb because the two planets are only 9 degrees 41 minutes apart. Lilly’s orb for the Sun is 17 degrees and for the Moon is 12.5 degrees; thus, 17 + 12.5 = 29.5 degrees, which divided by 2 gives a maximum distance of 14.75 degrees within which the Sun and Moon can be considered conjunct. Lilly does not comment that the Moon is under the Sun’s beams (within 17 degrees of the Sun, <span class="ital">CA</span> 113). The Moon fortunately is not combust (within 8.5 degrees and in the same sign as the Sun, <span class="ital">CA</span> 113), which is a plus for the missing brother since combustion is very bad for the Moon. </p>
<p class="tx">Lilly quotes an aphorism about <span class="ital">combustion of the Moon</span>: “35. In all Questions, know there’s not so great an affliction to the Moon, as when she is in conjunction with the Sun; <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he ill aspects of the Infortunes do much afflict her, but none so powerful as her Combus<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ion” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 301). If the Moon in this chart were a couple degrees closer to the Sun (placing it within the 8.5-degree limit), Luna would be combust the Sun and the brother would be judged to be in big doo-doo.</p>
<p class="Ahead">When Hear of Him?</p>
<p class="Q4-nsa-">You see Venus is Lady of the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span>, and Saturn is Lord of the Ascendant; if you consider the Signs they are in, and the several degrees of each planet in the Sign, you <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>hall observe that as well the Significator of the absent Brother, who is Venus, as Saturn, Lord of the Ascendant, do apply to each other by a friendly trine: for Saturn though a ponderous Planet, yet being Retrograde and in more degrees of the Sig<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>han Venus, doth by Retrogradation apply to meet her: a very good argument that <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he Querent should hear news of his Brother very suddenly; and if you look in the Ephemeris of Eickstadius 1645 Novemb.7, you shall find the true time of the trin<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> aspect betwixt <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page206" title="206"></span>Saturn and Venus to be at five of the clock the same day the question was asked in the afternoon; but with reduction to our London Meridian, a lit<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>le after four: I therefore advised the querent to go to the Carriers [haulers] of those Counties [the original text says “countries,” which must be a typo since later Lilly refers to the County where the brother was] where he knew his Brother had been and ask of them when they saw the quesited [the absent brother]; for I told him, it was probable he should hear of him that very day; upon the reason only because the Significators of both parties met by a friendly trine. He hath since confidently affirmed, that about the very moment of time, viz. about four, a Carrier came casu<span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>lly where he was, and informed him his Brother was in health and living. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 198)</span></p>
<p class="tx">By modern computer calculations, transiting Venus perfected the trine to transiting Saturn at 11:29 a.m. GMT, shortly <span class="ital">before</span> the horary question was asked and about five hours earlier than Lilly calculated it to perfect, given the ephemeris of his times<span class="ital">.</span> Venus rules the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house (the missing) brother, and Saturn rules the Ascendant (the querent). Venus is advancing at a faster than average speed, and retrograde Saturn is moving in apparent backward motion. Lilly interpreted the perfection of the trine between Venus <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>nd a retrograde Saturn so close to the time of the question (he believed it occurred shortly after he asked the question) as meaning that the querent would “very suddenly” receive news about his brother. </p>
<p class="tx">Each visible planet has a certain diameter when we look at it in the sky. Astronomers call the width of a visible planet its “apparent size” or “angular diameter.” Apparent size i<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds and simply means how big the planet appear<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> when we look at it in the sky. Keep in mind that a circle contains 360 degrees. The apparent size of a planet will vary with its distance from the Earth and its location in its orbit around the Sun. Table 14 is a list of the visible planets with their range of apparent sizes.</p>
<p class="tx">The table of apparent sizes reveals that the largest diameter of Venus as seen from the Earth is 63 seconds of arc (a little more than 1’ of arc), and the largest diameter of Saturn is almost 20 seconds of arc. If the two planets were just touching side by side, the total length from the beginning of one planet to the end of the other would be 63” + 20” = 83”. Half of 83” is 41.5”, which is the maximum distance the planets can be apart and still maintain a bodily aspect between them (<a href="HA-25.html">Figure 6</a>). Thus, if the modern ephemeris is correct, Venus was separating from a trine to Saturn at the time of the horary question and Lilly’s interpretation of the chart is based on a miscalculation of the positions of Venus and Saturn. What a difference a minute of arc can make!</p>

<p class="tx">Another interesting point this table makes is that although Neptune and Pluto are too small to be seen with the naked eye, Uranus sometimes grows almost to the size of Mercury in the sky and can be seen with the naked eye. Thus, by their own logic, astrologers who claim that they deal only with visible planets must include Uranus in their charts.</p>
<p class="Ahead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page208" title="208"></span>Lilly’s Orbs and Moieties</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly used his table of orbs to determine whether two planets were in aspect. As first discussed in <a href="HA-6.html">Chapter 6</a> of this book, Lilly called a half part of each orb its <span class="ital">moiety</span>. For example, in Lilly’s table, the orb of Saturn is 10<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 00', so the moiety of Saturn is half that number, or 5<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 00'. Similarly, the orb of Venus is 8<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 00', so the moiety of Venus is half that number, o<span class="CharOverride-4">r</span> 4<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 00'. Thus, if Venus and Saturn lie within 9<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> (the sum of their moieties, i.e., 4<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> for Venus + 5<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> for Saturn = 9<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span>), they are within orb of a <span class="ital">platick</span> aspect with each other (<span class="ital">CA</span> 107). For example, Venus at 10<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Taurus forms a trine with Saturn at 18<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Virgo because they are 8 degrees away from a perfect trine and lie within the sum of their moieties.</p>
<p class="Ahead">Void of Course (VOC) According to Lilly</p>
<p class="txni">Lilly used the concept of moieties to decide whether the Moon or any other planet was void of course (VOC), which he defined like this: </p>
<p class="Q4">A planet is void of course when he is separated from a Planet, nor doth forthwith, during his being in that Sign, apply to any other. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 112)</span></p>
<p class="tx">This most commonly applies to the void-of-course Moon, which symbolizes the general flow of events surrounding the question, and </p>
<p class="Q4">you shall seldom see a business go handsomely forward when she is so. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 112)</span></p>
<p class="tx">When the Moon enters the aspect void, nothing much happens to advance the querent’s interests; little happens to alter the status quo. While it is void of course, the Moon is traveling through an aspect vacuum, and it is the aspects that provide the power that drives the chart. Nothing happens when the Moon is applying to nothing. To use a modern metaphor, a VOC Moon is like a car spinning its wheels, going nowhere fast.</p>
<p class="tx">In his list of aphorisms, Lilly writes:</p>
<p class="Q4">Generally consider the state of the Moon, for if she be void of course there’s no great hopes of the Question propounded, that it shall be effected; yet if she be in Cancer, Taurus, Sagittarius or Pisces, your fear may be less, for then she is not much impedited by being void of course. (<span class="ital">CA</span> 299) </p>
<p class="tx">Note that being void of course should not be interpreted in isolation but must be considered in the context of the entire chart. For example, despite being void, the Moon ca<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> do well in Cancer (domicile of the Moon, exaltation of Jupiter), Taurus (exaltation of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page209" title="209"></span>Moon, domicile of Venus), Sagittarius (domicile of Jupiter), and Pisces (domicile of Jupiter, exaltation of Venus). Of course, Jupiter and Venus are the two classical benefics that indicate good fortune.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly probably borrowed his ideas about the void-of-course Moon from Bonatti, who wrote:</p>
<p class="Q4">Consider, Whether the Moon be void of course? For that signifies that the thing enquired after shall scarce ever come to a good end, and not without much labour, sorrow, and trouble, unless the Lord of the Ascendant or significator of the thing<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">s</span>hall be in very good condition, and then it may be hindered, but not wholly frustrated; yet ’tis a good time then for drinking, bathing, feasting, &amp;c., and to use ointments for taking away of hair, especially if she be in Scorpio. … Consider, Whether the Moon be in Cancer, Taurus, Sagittarius, or Pisces; for it signifies good in the business, although she be joined to the Infortunes and not to the Fortunes; nor does she, being void of course, prejudice so much in those places as elsewhere, provided she be not Combust, for then they will advantage her little or nothing. (Bonatti 1676, 30)</p>
<p class="tx">In general, the void-of-course Moon suggests that efforts directed toward accomplishing a goal are likely to be futile or ineffective. The VOC Moon can be interpreted as a slowing down, inaction, or an impediment to the realization of the matter inquired about. Under a void-of-course Moon, the business can be accomplished only with great effort and difficulty, if at all. As Lilly points out, a void-of-course Moon poses less of a problem when Luna occupies the signs of her major dignities (Cancer or Taurus) or the signs of Jupiter (Sagittarius or Pisces), the greater benefic. In addition, the behavior of the Moon during the void period carries forward the nature of the most recent aspect that Luna perfected before going void.</p>
<p class="tx">Applying Lilly’s definition, the Moon, during its stay in any sign, must be separated from another planet and, as it moves forward in the sign, must be more distant from the next planet that it might aspect by more than the sum of its moiety plus the moiety of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">n</span>ext aspectable planet. Lilly’s definition differs from the modern version of void of course, which states that the Moon must not <span class="ital">perfect</span> any aspect before leaving its sign. Lilly says that the Moon must not <span class="ital">apply</span> to aspect another planet to be considered void of course. It is important to note that Lilly is referring only to aspects involving the seven visible planets of antiquity when judging void-of-course status.</p>

Jupiter day, Venus hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 19<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 48' Pisces. <br/>The Moon in Libra separates from an opposition to Venus in Aries and then briefly <br/>becomes void of course until it gets within orb of a square to Mars in Cancer.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page211" title="211"></span>A good example of Lilly’s use of void of c<span class="roman">ourse can be seen in his chart called “If the Presbytery shall stand?” (</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 439), asked in Londo</span>n by Thomas Middleton, an MP and member of the army, on 21 March 1647 at 4:48:10 p.m. LMT (<a href="HA-25.html">Chart 25</a>). At the time, the political party of the Presbyterian Puritans was in control of much of England and was taking steps against Oliver Cromwell and the New Model Army, of which Middleton wa<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> a member. Interestingly, Venus is the lord of the hour in this horary chart, in which Lilly <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>ssigns the Presbyterians the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, ruled by Venus. In Lilly’s birth chart, Venus occupies the natal 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> Whole Sign house and closely opposes his natal Saturn in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> Whole Sign house, revealing Lilly’s close personal connection with this horary question.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly argues that the Presbytery will falter for two reasons: (1) the Moon is void of course in the horary chart, and (2) Jupiter, a general signifier of religion, will soon station direct and within about five weeks transit from Cancer (its sign of exaltation) into the fixed sign Leo, where Jupiter will enter the terms of malefic Saturn for the first six degrees of Leo, encountering several “obnoxious” fixed stars, and then advance into the terms of Mercury, which lies in its detriment and fall in Pisces (<span class="ital">CA</span> 440).</p>
<p class="tx">In this chart, the Moon lies at 13<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 44' Libra. The next two planets that the Moon will aspect are, in order, Mars at 25<span class="CharOverride-6"> o</span> 38' Cancer and Jupiter at 28<span class="CharOverride-6"> o</span> 35' Cancer. </p>
<p class="tx">The Moon has a moiety of 6<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 15', and Mars has a moiety of 3<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 45'. The sum of these moieties is 10<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 00', but the Moon is separated from Mars by a distance of 25<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 38' (Mars) <span class="CharOverride-4">m</span>inus 13<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 44' (Moon), or 11<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 54', which is 1<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 54' more than the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> orb allowed for the Moon to be considered applying to square Mars. Thus, the Moon in Libra will go briefly void of course, that is, during the next 1<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 54' in its sign, at which point it will begin to appl<span class="CharOverride-4">y</span> to square Mars in Cancer and no longer be void.

<p class="tx">Lilly says: “We find the Moon, in plain language, (after <span class="ital">a little being void of course</span>) run hastily to the square of Mars and Jupiter; intimating, the Commonality will defraud the expectation of the Clergy, and so strongly oppose them, that the end thereof shall wholly delude the expectation of the Clergy” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 442). In this chart, the Moon is only briefly void of course, and things don’t work out well for the clergy. As Lilly points out, “You shall seldom see a business go handsomely forward when she is so”<span class="ital"> </span>(<span class="ital">CA</span> 112), i.e., when the Moon is void of course. </p>
<p class="tx">The behavior of the Moon during its void period is colored by the last aspect that the Moon perfected before going void—in this case, an opposition to Venus in the unfortunat<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death, with Venus ruling the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of church matters and the clergy. Thus, one would not expect church matters to go well during the Moon’s void period in the middle of Libra, especially since the Moon’s next aspect will be a square to Mars, ruler of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death.</p>
<p class="tx">Does it make a difference whether the Moon is void at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sign? The following remarks about the VOC Moon take into account some comments from Wroskopos’s blog (posted 19 February 2010), who attended a workshop of Deborah Houlding.</p>
<p class="tx">A VOC Moon <span class="ital">at the beginning of a sign</span> suggests that the situation is in its very initial stages, and there will be inaction, inactivity, or delay in initiating the course of action.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page213" title="213"></span>A VOC Moon <span class="ital">in the middle of a sign</span> means that the situation has come to a standstill, or it is beset by delays, inactivity, and idling until things get going again. For example, Wade Caves reports a horary in which the querent wants to know whether he will complet<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> all the requirements on time to be able to get a grant to study at college (Caves, episod<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> 18). In this horary chart, the Moon has just gone void of course at 6 degrees in its sign. Regarding the question, the querent’s application process has been delayed because his high school transcript did not arrive at the university in a timely manner. The querent i<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> beset by a period of waiting and inactivity before he can find out whether he will receive the desired assistance.</p>
<p class="tx">A VOC Moon <span class="ital">at the end of a sign</span> typically implies that “you shall seldom see a business go handsomely forward” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 112). The matter may come to naught. The result inquired about may not manifest. Actions taken may prove to be futile or ineffective. Nothing significant regarding the question may take place. Any result achieved will only be accomplished slowly and with great effort, or with shame or loss. The matter may have already <span class="CharOverride-4">p</span>rogressed to the point at which there is nothing the querent can do to affect the outcome.</p>
<p class="tx">Lilly gives an example in which the Moon at the end of a sign would be considered void of course by the modern definition but which he did not regard as VOC because the Moon applied to an opposition to the Sun. On 27 June 1646 at 7:33:56 a.m. LMT in London (<a href="HA-25.html">Chart 26</a>), a woman asked Lilly if she would marry the gentleman she desired (<span class="ital">CA</span> 385). The Moon lies at 27<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 17' Sagittarius and will perfect no aspect before leaving its sign. However, the Moon applies to oppose the Sun at 5<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 30' Cancer and will perfect that opposition in 8<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 12', which is well within the sum of the moieties of the Moon and the Sun (6<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 15' + 8<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 30' = 14<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 45' orb for the Sun-Moon aspect). </p>
<p class="tx">Lilly also says that he found “the Moon separated from void of course, and applying to the opposition of the Sun” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 386). The Moon came within 14<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 45' of opposing the Sun when it reached 20<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 45' Sagittarius; just prior to that, the Moon was void of course. In other <span class="CharOverride-4">w</span>ords, from the moment the Moon left its opposition to Mercury (Moon at 16<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 23' Sagittarius) and until the time the Moon reached 20<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 45' Sagittarius, she was void of course. </p>
<p class="tx">This same example is noteworthy because Lilly bases much of his interpretation on the false belief (based on the ephemeris of his epoch) that Jupiter was applying to sextile Saturn. By modern computer calculations, Jupiter was in fact separating from a sextile to Saturn<span class="CharOverride-4">.</span> Lilly’s chart for the horary question did not accord with the scientific reality of the planetary orbits as we understand them today. Was Lilly’s success in this case based on a lucky guess, accurate intuition, the suggestibility of his client, or some type of placebo effect? What is clear is that the horary principles Lilly used to delineate the chart were applied to inaccurate data, yet he counseled his client in such a way to bring about the desired outcome.</p>

<p class="Q4">And because Venus was not scarce removed from the Ascendant, but was in the Oriental quarter of Heaven, I judged he was not above one or two days journey from London. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 198)</span></p>
<p class="tx">Venus is at the end of Sagittarius inside the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, so Venus is not too far from the Ascendant at 20<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Capricorn.</p>
<p class="Q4">And because Venus was departing the Sign Sagittarius, and entering the Sign Capricorn, wherein she has essential dignities by Triplicity and Term, I judged the man was leaving the Country and place where he last was, and wherein he had no possession or habitation, and was coming to his own house in London, wherein he had good propriety. <span class="roman">(</span><span class="ital">CA</span><span class="roman"> 198–199)</span></p>

<p class="txni">Recently I’ve been experimenting with <span class="ital">dodecatemoria</span> (Greek: <span class="greek"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-14" src="../resources/177.jpg"/></span>), or dw<span class="roman">ads (12th parts) in horary charts. The basic idea is that each 30-degree sign is divided in</span>to 12 equal parts of 2.5 degrees, each of which is a reflection of an entire sign. The first 2.5-degree part has the same nature as its sign, the second part belongs to the next sign in zodiacal order, and so on for the remaining parts. There are two ways of sequencing the dodecatemoria. The Hellenistic method starts the sequence at the beginning of the sign, as does the Jyotish divisional chart of <span class="ital">dwadasamsa</span>, hence the abbreviation <span class="ital">dwad</span> for a 12<span class="superscript-roman _idGenCharOverride-1">th</span> part. The Babylonian method, found in Paulus of Alexandria, begins the sequence from the degree in question, and some authors reserve the name <span class="ital">dodecatemorion</span> for th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> Babylonian method. In this book, I follow the Hellenistic and Hindu method of calculating dwads.</p>
<p class="tx">In the “absent brother” chart (chart 27), the dwad (12<span class="superscript-roman _idGenCharOverride-1">th</span> part) of the Ascendant lies at 5<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 24’ Virgo. Hellenistic astrologers concerned themselves mainly with the zodiacal sign of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part, any planets in that sign, and the placement of the ruler of the sign of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part. The symbolism of these factors should match the querent’s concerns and current situation. </p>
<p class="tx">In chart 27, the specific degree of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of the Ascendant lies in the Regiomontanus 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, which signifies a direction to the west of the querent. Virgo (the sign of <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of the Ascendant) is on the cusp of the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of death. The ruler of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part is Mercury, which occupies Scorpio in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of travel. Clearly, the querent is concerned about the possible death of someone who is traveling at a distance.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"></a>Chart 27: Lilly: Absent Brother Horary with Regiomontanus Houses and Ptolemy’s Terms <br/>17 November 1645, 11:43 a.m. LMT, London. Dwad of Ascendant is at 5<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 24' Virgo.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page218" title="218"></span>The Moon, a general signifier of fugitives (at 15<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 52’ Scorpio), has its 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part at 10<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 24’ Taurus in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house. Venus, the ruler of the Moon’s 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part, lies in Sagittarius in the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. Lilly notes that the brother came home when the Moon arrived by transit at the body of Venus (which is the ruler of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of the Moon in this chart).</p>
<p class="tx">The 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of Venus lies at 17<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 12' Scorpio, which is just 1 degree 20 minutes away from the Moon (at 15<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 52' Scorpio), suggesting that the querent (co-ruled by the Moon) will unite with his absent brother (Venus) in a short time (perhaps a little more than a day or a little more than a week).</p>
<p class="tx">The 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of <span class="ital">Pars Fortunae</span> lies at 10<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> Taurus in the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of local travel, where it conjoins the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of the Moon (the missing brother), symbolizing his safe journey.</p>
<p class="tx">To use table 16, find the zodiac sign along the top row and the degrees in that sign down the left-hand column. Look across to find the associated 12<span class="superscript-roman _idGenCharOverride-1">th</span> part of the sign.</p>
<p class="tx">The sign of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part, or dwad, of the Ascendant often indicates what the querent is concerned about. In Lilly’s case of the missing brother, the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of the Ascendant lie<span class="CharOverride-4">s</span> in Virgo, the sign on the 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> cusp of death, and the querent was worried that his brother might be dead. This supports the idea that the chart is radical.</p>

<p class="txni">The sign of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of the Moon can help to determine whether a lost object will be found. Observations from the astrological literature about the Moon and its dwad in horary charts include the following:</p>
<p class="list1">• If the <span class="ital">sign</span> of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part of the Moon is on the Ascendant or the Midheaven of the horary chart, the missing thing will usually be found. </p>
<ul>
<li class="Bl2">If the Sun occupies the <span class="ital">sign</span> of the Moon’s 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> part (or if the Sun occupies the same sign as the Moon’s dispositor), the missing object will come to light. </li>
<li class="Bl2">Finally, if the Moon applies by major aspect to its own dispositor, that which is missing is likely to be found.<p class="tx-sa _idGenParaOverride-1">In Lilly’s chart of the missing brother, the <span class="ital">dispositor</span> of the Scorpio Moon is Mars, which lies in the same sign as the Sun, so the missing brother will come to light. In addition, the Moon will conjoin its dispositor, Mars, just before Luna leaves the sign of Scorpio <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>o enter Sagittarius.</p><p class="tx _idGenParaOverride-1">A note on 12<span class="superscript-roman _idGenCharOverride-1">th</span> parts, or dwads: The Babylonians used the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> parts at least as far back as the fifth century BCE. Masha’allah describes their use in interrogational astrology in his ess<span class="roman">ay “On Hidden Things</span><span class="roman">.” Since I </span>started trying Masha’allah’s method, I have found 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> parts (especially that of the Ascendant) to be extremely helpful in horary charts. Many software programs will calculate the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> parts, and a web search for “dodecatemoria calculator” will list sites that calculate these parts online.</p></li>
