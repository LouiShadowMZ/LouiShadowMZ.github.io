<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-40">THE MISSING DOG TREATS</p>
<p class="txni">A friend sent me an email asking for help locating a missing item. He had recently bought some treats for his dog and they were nowhere to be found. I cast a chart for my location for the time I read and understood his email. I responded that he would find them very quickly (within a day or two) and indicated a general location. He found the missing item within thirty-six hours of asking the question. </p>
<p class="tx">My friend sent the email from New York City at 7:35 p.m. EDT on Friday, 11 September 2015. His exact words were: </p>
<p class="Q4">I bought a bag of dog treats for Ruby and don’t know where they are. Can you do a chart and help me find them?</p>
<p class="tx">Ruby is his pet pit bull, a lovely dog. I cast the chart for my location at the time I understood his request and took the Ascendant to represent my friend who asked the question: 11 September 2015 at 9:18 p.m. EDT, 41N17, 73W02 (chart 39).</p>
<p class="tx">Taurus rises, so Venus signifies the querent. The chart is cast on a Venus day during a Venus hour. Venus is an appropriate symbol because he is seeking something that gives great pleasure to his pet.</p>
<p class="tx">The Moon is his co-ruler, and the Moon is also almuten of the Ascendant. The missing dog treats are signified by the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of possessions, with Gemini on the cusp, makin<span class="CharOverride-4">g</span> Mercury the ruler of the dog treats. Mercury also rules and occupies the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of pets, so the symbolism seems apt. Mercury is applying to sextile Venus in less than a degree<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> though from a cadent house, so I thought he would find the missing item fairly quickly<span class="CharOverride-4">,</span> within a couple of days at most. </p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"></a>Chart 39: Missing Dog Treats <br/>11 September 2015, 9:18 p.m. EDT, 41N17, 73W02. Venus day, Venus hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 22<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 48' Libra.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page277" title="277"></span>The Moon, my friend’s co-ruler and Ascendant almuten, rules the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house of transport and the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of his home, so I wondered if he could have misplaced them in transit from the store to his home. Mercury, the dog treats, has as its most recent separating aspect a square to Pluto in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, another travel house. This suggested that the dog treats may have been lost in transit, which also made common sense since my friend had thoroughly searched his apartment and could not find the dog treats anywhere.</p>
<p class="tx">Assuming that Pluto can symbolize complications, I thought he might have left them in his vehicle (Mercury separating from a square to Pluto in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>). Pluto has recently been involved in a square with Mercury (the dog treats) and a trine with the Ascendant (the querent), so this distant dwarf planet seemed to be playing a role in the story of the missing items.</p>
<p class="tx">The 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house location of Mercury suggests they might be in a cabinet, drawer, or compartment. Mercury in Libra suggests an upper location. My friend has a small country house, and he owns a small truck, which he keeps at his country place. When I inquired, <span class="CharOverride-4">h</span>e told me he had gone in his truck to buy the dog treats, so I suggested he search the truck in an upper location or a compartment at the level of his chest or higher (Mercury in Libra, an Air sign). </p>
<p class="tx">The querent emailed me early Sunday afternoon (13 September 2015), two days after asking the question, saying, “They were in the truck in one of the chest-high cabinets in the truck bed.” According to the ephemeris, transiting Mercury (the dog treats) perfected its sextile to horary Venus (the querent) at 6:28 a.m. on Sunday morning and the transiting Moon entered the horary 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house at 1:28 p.m. Sunday afternoon. Interestingly, he found the dog treats at approximately the same time that the transiting Moon (his co-ruler) entered the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of pets, where Mercury (ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house of the missing possession) was located.</p>
<p class="tx">I never would have guessed the specific location (the truck) from the chart, but the idea of the treats being misplaced in transit did occur to me when studying the chart and <span class="CharOverride-4">i</span>t led to his finding the missing item. One might assume that the 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house would represent some kind of utility room where work is done. It turns out that the querent uses his truck in this manner as a kind of mobile workshop. He bought the truck specifically to do projects around his little country home in the woods in a remote part of New York State.</p>
<p class="tx">Initially I assumed that he took the dog treats home to New York City. In the querent’s own mind, he was convinced he had taken the item into his house. The “common sense” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page278" title="278"></span>part of the analysis (and what I usually do with these types of questions) is to ask when the querent last saw the missing item and to have him retrace his steps, at least mentally. </p>
<p class="tx">The last aspect made by the significator of the missing item (or the Moon, as the general signifier of wanderers) often indicates where the object was previously. In this case, 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> ruler Mercury was separating from Pluto in the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, and Pluto was separating from the Ascendant (the querent). The Moon’s last aspect was a square to Saturn, ruler of the 9<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span>, a travel house. On questioning further, I found out that he had bought the treats near his country place while driving his truck and took them back to his apartment in NYC, so the truck was a logical place to search. I never would have guessed a truck without discussing the chart and the situation further with my friend. </p>
<p class="tx">Because the Moon can act as a co-ruler of the querent, Lilly’s comment about the querent’s ruler separating from Saturn also applies: “Behold from whom the Lord of th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> ascendant did last separate, and if he did separate from Saturn, the cause of the lost thing was through forgetfulness of the owner, who knows not where he laid it, or it is forgotten by reason of some cold or sickness which afflicted the loser, especially if Saturn be Retrograde” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 321).</p>
<p class="tx">A few days after working with this chart, I was looking through Ivy Goldstein-Jacobson’s <span class="ital">Simplified Horary Astrology </span>(1960). On page 154 she says that if any of four significators occupies an angular house, then the missing item will be found in the home, or in a place where the querent usually uses the item (e.g., an office or workshop), or where the querent thinks <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he missing item might or ought to be. Applying Goldstein-Jacobson’s method of four significators to this chart, we identify the following as signifiers:</p>
<p class="list1">1. <span class="ital">Ruler of the 2</span><span class="ital CharOverride-6">nd</span><span class="ital"> house </span>of movable goods</p>
<p class="list2">2. <span class="ital">Moon</span>, which Goldstein-Jacobson regards as a co-ruler</p>
<p class="list2">3. <span class="ital">Venus</span>, the general signifier of valuables</p>
<p class="list3">4. <span class="ital">Dispositor of the Part of Fortune</span>, a symbol of one’s material wealth</p>
<p class="tx">In the dog treats chart, the ruler of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house is Mercury in the cadent 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house; the Moon lies in the succedent 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house; Venus lies at the very end of the 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, but by <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he 5-degree rule is considered to be under the influence of the succedent 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp; and finally the dispositor of the Part of Fortune is Venus conjunct the cadent 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house cusp. None of Jacobson’s four significators lies in an angular house, so the item is not likely to be in the home.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page279" title="279"></span>Significators in angular houses imply a location in the home or where the missing object is normally kept or ought to be. What about placements in succedent or cadent houses? Generally speaking, the further the missing item’s significator lies from the preceding angular house, the more difficult it is to find, sometimes because of increasing distance from its customary location. The closer the significator to the preceding angular house, the easier it is to find. </p>
<p class="tx">With regard to stolen goods, for example, Lilly says that “if the Lord of the term of the Moon, or the Lord of the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> be in a succedent House, then the things are about the Owner, and not much elongated” (<span class="ital">CA</span> 349). I don’t know whether this same “rule” applies to misplaced or lost items or solely to stolen ones. In any case, in this chart, the ruler of <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>he 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp is Mercury, and in Lilly’s system of bounds the Moon also lies in the <span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>erms of Mercury. The planet Mercury lies in the cadent 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, suggesting that th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> missing dog treats will be hard to find, perhaps because they are distant either from th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> querent’s home or from where they are usually kept.</p>
<p class="tx">Judging from Goldstein-Jacobson’s significators, Mercury in the cadent 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is far from the IC, Moon in the succedent 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house is moderately distant from the IC, and Venus at the cusp of the 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> is almost angular but just makes it into the succedent 5<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. The plurality of testimonies suggests that the missing dog treats are not too far from home and not too hard to find.</p>
