<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-47">WILL I FIND A BUYER FOR MY HOUSE? <br/>IF SO, WHEN?</p>
<p class="txni">The querent and his wife wanted to sell their home in Connecticut and move to California to be closer to their daughter and grandchildren. They had lived in the house for forty years and decided to put it on the market in the autumn of 2013. Several people came to look at the house and some seemed genuinely interested, but all potential buyers eventually backed out. Finally, on 24 May 2014, the querent asked, “Will I find a buyer for my house? If so, when?” The chart is cast for 24 May 2014, 5:27 p.m. EDT, 41N17, 73W02, Regiomontanus houses (chart 46). It is a Saturn day during a Mars hour.</p>
<p class="tx">It is a Mars hour and Mars rules the Ascendant, suggesting that the chart is radical. The degree of the Ascendant is early, which is one of the considerations before judgment. Perhaps current conditions will have to change for the result to be achieved. The Ascendant is also in the <span class="ital">via combusta,</span> reflecting the querent’s distress about the matter. The 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> par<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span> (<span class="ital">dwad</span> or <span class="ital">dodecatemorion</span>) of the ascending degree (at 2<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 18' Scorpio) lies at 27<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 36' Scorpio, almost exactly conjunct the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp, which is fitting because the querent is quite concerned about finances and being able to afford moving across the country and buying a new home on the expensive West Coast.</p>
<p class="tx">The potential buyer is shown by the Taurus 7<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, ruled by Venus. Unfortunately, the querent’s significator, Mars, forms no major aspect with the buyer’s significator, Venus. In addition, Mars (the querent) on the cusp of the 12<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house suggests that he may be undermining the sale of his home in some way, perhaps by asking too high a price in th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> current real estate market.</p>
<p class="tx">The price of the house is shown by the Leo 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, ruled by the Sun. The Sun is peregrine (without essential dignity) and resides in the unfortunate 8<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of loss and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page308" title="308"></span>anguish of mind. The poor state of the Sun suggests that the asking price is too high and may be driving potential buyers away.</p>
<p class="tx">The house itself is signified by the Aquarius 4<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, ruled by Saturn. Unfortunately, Saturn is retrograde and lies in the fixed sign Scorpio in the 1<span class="CharOverride-6">st</span> house, which represents the querent. Fixed signs suggest slow movement, resistance to change, and the desire to stay put. The Ascendant, which symbolizes the horary question, also lies in fixed Scorpio. Mars, the ruler of Scorpio, is also slow in motion. It looks like he will not be selling the house any time soon.</p>
<p class="tx">There is a ray of hope, however, because the Moon—a general signifier in all horary questions—applies to conjoin Venus (the potential buyer). The Moon lies in cardinal Aries in the cadent 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house. The Moon-Venus conjunction will perfect in 8 degrees 29 minutes. Given the fact that the Ascendant lies in fixed Scorpio and the Moon occupies cardinal Aries in the cadent 6<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house, I estimate that he will eventually have an offer in about eight and a half months (using the equivalence of one degree per month). The question was <span class="CharOverride-4">a</span>sked at the end of May 2014; adding 8.5 months to this date takes us to the first week in February 2015. I tell the querent not to expect a buyer until February 2015.</p>
<p class="tx">The querent continued to try to sell his house without success until November of 2014. He took it off the market in December of 2014 because he and his wife did not want to bother with open house showings during the harsh New England winter weather. He listed his house again but at a lower price in February of 2015. It went on the market on February 15, and a week later he got an offer from a buyer who had seen the house the previous year but was not in a position to buy it at that time. A contract to sell the home was signed at the end of February of 2015, confirming the original interpretation of the horary chart in May of 2014.</p>
