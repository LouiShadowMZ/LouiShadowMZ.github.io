<p class="_ct" id="_idParaDest-45">IVY M. GOLDSTEIN-JACOBSON: WHERE IS THE YARDAGE?</p>
<p class="txni">Ivy M. Goldstein-Jacobson, born April 13, 1893, in Brisbane, Australia, was a self-published astrologer best known for her 1960 book <span class="ital">Simplified Horary Astrology</span>. She had a major influence on how American astrologers came to view horary as a branch of astrology worthy of serious study, and her devoted student Gilbert Navarro still teaches her methods. She died on 5 May 1990 at 7:30 p.m. in Arcadia, CA.</p>
<p class="tx">On page 156 of her book, she discusses a horary question, “Where is the yardage I bought?” asked at “11:29 a.m. PDST” on 10 August 1955 in Los Angeles, California. I assume by “yardage” she means fabric sold by the yard. Using the data that Goldstein-Jacobson provides in her book (11:29 PDST) generates a chart with a slightly different Ascendant than the one she presents, which appears to be cast for about 11:31 a.m. I was curious whether Lilly’s practice of Regiomontanus houses would make any difference in analyzing this chart, so I cast it in Regiomontanus instead of Placidus, which Goldstein-Jacobson preferred (<a href="HA-40.html">Chart 44</a>). The change of house systems made no difference in the outcome.</p>
<p class="tx">The author tells us that the querent found the missing yardage at 1:40 p.m. PDT the same day. It was East by North in the guest room where she normally works with the yardage “in a middle-height drawer of a highboy” (a tall chest of drawers). Let’s see if we can find this result in the chart.</p>
<p class="tx">Jacobson-Goldstein doesn’t mention it, but the first thing I noticed is that the Ascendant at 23<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 03' Libra, despite being in the <span class="ital">via combusta,</span> is almost exactly conjunct the benefic fixed star Spica. This fortunate configuration indicates that she may be able to find the missing item, despite its being obscured (<span class="ital">via combusta).</span> Lilly used a handful of major fixed stars, including Spica, in his work.</p>

<p class="caption-center"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"></a>Chart 44: Where Is the Yardage? <br/>10 August 1955, 11:29 a.m. PDT, Los Angeles, CA. Mercury day, Mars hour. <br/>Regiomontanus houses. Dwad of Ascendant is at 6<span class="CharOverride-6">o</span> 48' Cancer.</p>
<p class="tx"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page301" title="301"></span>Libra rises, making Venus the querent’s primary ruler. Saturn is almuten at the Ascendant and may function as a co-ruler. Saturn (co-ruler of the querent) moving in less tha<span class="CharOverride-4">n</span> five degrees to make a partile conjunction with the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp (her goods) is an indication that she will recover the missing yardage. The Moon is a universal co-ruler of the querent.</p>
<p class="tx">With Scorpio on the 2<span class="CharOverride-6">nd</span> house cusp, Mars is the significator of the missing goods. Mars in the angular 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house suggests that the yardage is in the home or in a place where she normally uses it. Mars also rules sharp instruments, which may be a reference to her us<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> of the cloth in sewing. The querent’s primary ruler, Venus, will conjoin Mars in about eight degrees, another indication that she will recover the missing item.</p>
<p class="tx">Mars (the missing goods) lies in Leo, a fiery sign. All Fire signs suggest an easterly location, and Leo specifically indicates a direction that is East by North. Remember that the chart must tell the story. Here, Mars amidst several other planets in the same sign of Leo and in the same astrological house suggests that the yardage will be found in a place it shares with several other possessions. The querent found it in a tall chest of drawers.</p>
<p class="tx">Leo, a Fire sign, implies a location above the level of the floor or ground. Fire and Air are upwardly directed, centrifugal “masculine” elements. Earth and Waters are downwardly directed, centripetal “feminine” elements and suggest locations near or beneath the level of the floor or the ground. In this case, the missing item was in the middle-height drawer of a tall chest with legs. It may be that the sign Leo refers to the legs on the chest of <span class="CharOverride-4">d</span>rawers because in some styles of furniture lion paw motifs are used for decoration.</p>
<p class="tx">Interestingly, this chart has the Ascendant in a nodal degree, which Ivy Goldstein-Jacobson said “points to catastrophe, casualty, fatality or tragedy,” but none of those happened in this case. The querent successfully found her missing yardage. Perhaps th<span class="CharOverride-4">e</span> “fated” quality of the chart has to do with its inclusion in Goldstein-Jacobson’s influential book on horary astrology as a key example of finding lost objects. This interpreta<span class="CharOverride-4">t</span>ion makes sense given the fact that the North Node in Sagittarius conjoins the 3<span class="CharOverride-6">rd</span> house cusp of writing and is disposed by Jupiter in Leo in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house of public exposure, fame, and recognition. Jupiter is also closely conjoined the Ascendant-ruler Venus in Leo in the 10<span class="CharOverride-6">th</span> house.</p>
