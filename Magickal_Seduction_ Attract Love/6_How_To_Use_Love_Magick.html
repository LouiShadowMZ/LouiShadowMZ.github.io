        <h1 id="heading_6" class="text-left">How To Use Love Magick</h1><p class="text-left">There are three main rituals in this book. The first ritual is aimed at making passion arise in somebody. This will work so long as you have some contact with the person. It's not going to work on movie stars, unless you happen to be friends with them already. It is ideal in situations where you want a relationship with a specific person, but nothing has happened yet. It can also be used when there is some attraction, but the other party doesn't seem as passionate as you want them to be.</p><p class="text-left">本书中有三个主要的仪式。第一个仪式旨在激起某人的激情。只要你与此人有所接触，这个仪式就会奏效。它对电影明星无效，除非你碰巧已经是他们的朋友。它非常适合那些你想与特定的人建立关系，但尚未发生任何事情的情况。当已经存在一些吸引力，但对方似乎不像你希望的那样热情时，也可以使用它。</p><p class="text-left">The next part of the book looks at Love Spells. There is an extremely powerful ritual for making somebody fall in love with you. Some people try this spell from the outset, but I recommend using this when there is already some attraction. Ideally, use the first ritual to ignite passion and then turn it into love. Be certain you actually want somebody to be in love with you. If they are married, for example, do you really want the fallout? It's fine if you do, but go into this with your eyes wide open. The magick works, so don't use it casually.</p><p class="text-left">本书的下一部分着眼于爱情咒语。有一个极其强大的仪式可以让他人爱上你。有些人从一开始就尝试这个咒语，但我建议在已经存在一些吸引力时使用它。理想情况下，先使用第一个仪式点燃激情，然后再将其转化为爱。要确定你确实希望某人爱上你。例如，如果他们已经结婚，你真的想要那种后果吗？如果你愿意，那没关系，但要睁大眼睛去做这件事。魔法会起作用，所以不要轻易使用它。</p><p class="text-left">The next part of the book looks at creating a general aura of attraction around yourself. It takes the opening ritual and modifies it so that you disturb the aura of all you meet, making them see you as attractive. Be prepared for strong results from this, because it works fast and it works powerfully.</p><p class="text-left">本书的下一部分着眼于在你周围创造一个普遍的吸引力光环。它采用开场仪式并对其进行修改，以便你扰动所有遇见你的人的光环，让他们觉得你有吸引力。要为这个仪式的强大效果做好准备，因为它见效快且效果强大。</p>
