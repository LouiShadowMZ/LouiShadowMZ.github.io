        <h1 id="heading_5" class="text-left">Magick in the Real World</h1><p class="text-left">Around twenty years ago, I attended a prestigious book launch in London. I'd broken up with a fairly long-term girlfriend, but I was in a good place mentally and emotionally. I was neither desperate to replace her, nor wanting to be alone. This casual confidence is a great state of mind for seduction.</p><p class="text-left">大约二十年前，我在伦敦参加了一场著名的图书发布会。我刚和一位交往颇久的女友分手，但我当时精神和情感状态都很好。我既不急于取代她，也不想独自一人。这种随意的自信是诱惑的绝佳心态。</p><p class="text-left">I was aware that I wanted to meet new people, and seduce new people, but rather than being desperate about it I simply made sure I went to lots of social events. I decided to use the magick that's explained in this book, to make me generally more attractive to people.</p><p class="text-left">我知道我想结识新朋友，诱惑新朋友，但我并没有为此感到绝望，只是确保自己多参加社交活动。我决定使用这本书中解释的魔法，让自己对人们更具吸引力。</p><p class="text-left">For the first week, I met a lot of interesting people, and there were a few women who seemed to be interested in me, but I didn't pursue it and neither did they.</p><p class="text-left">第一周，我认识了很多有趣的人，也有几个女人似乎对我有兴趣，但我没有主动追求，她们也没有。</p><p class="text-left">At the book launch I was introduced to a woman who I will refer to only as Z, and she was the most beautiful woman I had met at that point in my life. To my astonishment she seemed genuinely interested in me.</p><p class="text-left">在图书发布会上，我被介绍给一位我只称之为Z的女士，她是我当时一生中见过的最美丽的女人。令我惊讶的是，她似乎真的对我有兴趣。</p><p class="text-left">It was like one of those meetings in a movie, where it's completely obvious that the couple are about to fall in love. I was astonished at how well it was going, because although I am not bad looking, Z was way, way out of my league. My friends were watching in amused awe, probably wondering when I was going to screw it up.</p><p class="text-left">那就像电影中的一次邂逅，很明显这对情侣即将坠入爱河。我对自己进展如此顺利感到惊讶，因为虽然我不算难看，但Z的条件远非我所能及。我的朋友们在一旁又好笑又敬畏地看着，大概在想我什么时候会搞砸。</p><p class="text-left">Out of nowhere I found myself telling Z that she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever met, and she replied by saying that she found me attractive. I asked her to meet me for lunch the next day, and she agreed, immediately giving me her phone number. She then told me that she had a boyfriend, and wasn't sure what to do about that yet, but that she did want to meet me. So, despite the odds, I'd attracted Z. The magick worked.</p><p class="text-left">我不知从哪里冒出一句，告诉Z她是我见过最美的女人，她回答说她觉得我很有魅力。我约她第二天共进午餐，她立刻同意并给了我她的电话号码。然后她告诉我她有男朋友，还不确定该怎么办，但她确实想见我。所以，尽管困难重重，我还是吸引了Z。魔法起作用了。</p><p class="text-left">What followed is the interesting part. I kept drinking and kept talking to her, and partly I was enjoying a massive ego-trip. I wanted my friends to be slightly jealous and to admire me for getting this beautiful woman interested in me. And that was my mistake. Within an hour I was so drunk that I lost my cool, and although my memory of the evening isn't too clear I know that I made an idiot of myself. Before she left, Z told me that she wasn't going to meet me the next day.</p><p class="text-left">接下来发生的事情很有趣。我一直喝酒，一直和她聊天，部分原因是我当时非常自我膨胀。我希望我的朋友们会有点嫉妒，并佩服我能让这位美丽的女士对我产生兴趣。而那正是我的错误所在。不到一个小时，我就醉得失去了冷静，虽然我对当晚的记忆不太清楚，但我知道我出尽了洋相。在她离开之前，Z告诉我她第二天不会来见我了。</p><p class="text-left">The lesson I learned is that sometimes, when the magick is done, you just need to leave. Often, a seduction goes so well that you go home together and jump into bed that night. Sometimes, though, it's obvious that things are going to be more long-term. When that happens, it's a good idea to make an arrangement to meet the person in question at another time. Once that's done you should leave social event as soon as you can. If you can not leave, politely excuse yourself and talk to other people for the rest of the night. When your magick works, accept that it has worked and then make sure you don't ruin the power that has been put in place.</p><p class="text-left">我学到的教训是，有时候，当魔法完成时，你只需要离开。通常，一次诱惑进行得非常顺利，你们会一起回家，当晚就上床。但有时候，很明显事情会更长久。当这种情况发生时，最好是约定在另一个时间与对方见面。一旦约定好了，你应该尽快离开社交场合。如果不能离开，就礼貌地找个借口，在剩下的时间里和别人交谈。当你的魔法起作用时，接受它已经起作用的事实，然后确保你不会毁掉已经就位的力量。</p><p class="text-left">Making a future date is often a good idea anyway, if you have the patience. That way, you give the object of your affection gets to spend a whole night thinking about you before you meet again. There is great power in that.</p><p class="text-left">无论如何，如果你有耐心，安排未来的约会通常是个好主意。那样，你就能让你心仪的对象在再次见到你之前，花一整晚的时间想你。这其中蕴含着巨大的力量。</p><p class="text-left">Even the best magick can be screwed up by your own stupidity, impatience or over-enthusiasm. When you've made the date, get out of the way and then turn up for the date. Don't get drunk and show off. Powerful magick wears off quite quickly if you hang around getting unattractively drunk.</p><p class="text-left">即使是最好的魔法，也可能因为你自己的愚蠢、不耐烦或过度热情而搞砸。当你确定了约会，就离开，然后准时赴约。不要喝醉和炫耀。如果你在周围闲逛，喝得酩酊大醉，变得没有吸引力，强大的魔法会很快失效。</p><p class="text-left">This applies even in more formal settings, where there may be no alcohol or drugs involved. Imagine you're at a work conference, and you meet somebody during the lunch break and arrange to meet for dinner. At that point, excuse yourself and get out of the way. Don't hang around with the person all day. Get out of there and wait until dinner. Then you can work your magick all over again.</p><p class="text-left">这甚至适用于更正式的场合，那里可能没有酒精或毒品。想象一下你在一个工作会议上，午休时遇到某人，并安排共进晚餐。那时，就找个借口离开。不要整天和那个人待在一起。离开那里，等到晚餐。然后你可以重新施展你的魔法。</p><p class="text-left">Magick is only ever one factor in a situation. The magick in this book is so powerful it's effects will shock you, but you still need to apply the best judgment, style and grace that you can to make it pay off.</p><p class="text-left">魔法在任何情况下都只是一个因素。这本书中的魔法如此强大，其效果会让你震惊，但你仍然需要运用最佳的判断力、风格和优雅来使其发挥作用。</p>
