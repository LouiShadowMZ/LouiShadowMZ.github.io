 erhaps the most gratifying aspect of horary astrology is the ability to locate lost or missing objects, animals, and people. This chapter brings together information needed to interpret questions about things that are lost, misplaced, or stolen. Let me illustrate with a case example.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">THE CASE OF THE MISSING KITTEN</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On January 13, 1994, at 8:24 P.M., I received a phone call from a woman in New York City. Her kitten had been missing for over twenty-four hours and was nowhere to be found. She couldn't understand how the kitten might have escaped from the apartment. See Chart 29.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Seven degrees of Virgo rise on the Ascendant, fitting for a question about a young kitten (Virgo is associated with the 6th house of pets). The querent is ruled by Ascendant-ruler Mercury and is co-ruled by the Moon, which in this chart lies in the 6th house of pets and shows what is on the querent's mind.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The missing kitten is shown by the 6th house with Aquarius on the cusp. Saturn is the traditional ruler of Aquarius and is Almuten of the 6th. Thus, Saturn signifies the soughtafter kitten. Saturn occupies the 6th house (the 1st house of the kitten in the turned chart), suggesting that the kitten is still at home but is concealed and will be hard for the querent to find because it is in the cadent 6th of the querent. The Moon co-rules the querent and is applying to conjoin Saturn (the kitten) in nine degrees, implying that querent and kitten will be reunited, perhaps in nine hours.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="258-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Where is the kitten? Saturn lies toward the end of its sign at 28° Aquarius. Lilly wrote that "If your significator be going out of one sign and entering another, the thing is behind something or other, or is carefully fallen down betwixt two rooms, or near the threshold or joining together of two rooms, and is higher or lower in the place according to the nature of the sign, etc." (CA, p. 203). Aquarius often signifies upper rooms and locations near modern or electronic gadgets. Because Aquarius is the water bearer, it can symbolize places near water. Fixed signs imply places low down or near the floor.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0233" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The querent searched the upstairs rooms in her loft, especially the areas near electronic equipment like stereos and computers, but she did not find the kitten. The next evening she called to tell me she found the kitten in the upstairs bathroom. The small animal had entered the small door that is used to service the Jacuzzi and could not get out. The querent's pet had spent two days trapped inside the housing of the Jacuzzi, a modern electronic gadget connected with water!</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">WHERE IS IT?</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Let us now review the locations indicated by the mundane houses. If an item is lost, the house position of its significator will often show where it can be found. The signs are also helpful in this regard. Locations suggested by the signs were reviewed in the Chapter 10.</p>
<p class="cl-wlefthead">Locations Suggested by the Mundane Houses</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Angular houses imply that the lost object is where it ought to be, in the home or office, or where it is usually kept, in a place the querent frequents, nearby, quick and easy to find. Angular houses signify public or visible happenings.</p>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00066.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 29: Missing Kitten January 13, 1994, 8:24 P.M. EST, 73W01, 41 N19 Regiomontanus Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0234" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Succedent houses imply the lost item is not in its usual place and will be harder and take longer to find. The item may not be in the house, but it is usually nearby and may be out of doors, perhaps in an outbuilding, a garage, or in the yard.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Finally, cadent houses refer to places either literally far off or, if close by, symbolically distant by being hidden from view and almost impossible to find. Significators in cadent houses show the item may take a long time to locate, and may be found only indirectly, possibly by another person. Cadent houses signify hidden, concealed, or secret locations.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The following information on the individual houses is derived from various horary authors, both modern and classical. Some of the traditional locations may sound archaic. The reader should be creative, using the meanings below as symbols of possible locations. For example, a few years ago a friend was visiting for a weekend from Washington, D.C. She asked me to look at her transits and I noticed a lot of minor aspect activity (Moon, Mercury, Venus) in her twelfth house, all peaking on Monday. With tongue in cheek, I told her she might have an encounter with a large animal, like a cow. The 12th rules large animals. She returned to Washington on Sunday and called me Monday evening, sounding quite amused. My friend was undergoing psychoanalysis at the time. When she entered her analyst's office Monday morning, she noticed that he had placed a new painting over his couch. The painting depicted cows grazing in a field. She burst out laughing and had a lively analytic session.</p>
<p class="cl-wlefthead">Some Horary House Locations</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Note that if the significator of the missing object is in an angular (houses 1, 4, 7, 10), it should be easy to find; succedent (houses 2, 5, 8, 11), harder to find; and cadent (houses 3 ,6, 9, 12), concealed and very difficult to find. If the significator of the lost object lies in an intercepted sign, the item is enclosed and not in the open. If near a house cusp, then near a door, window, or passage between rooms. If "going out of one sign and entering another, the thing is behind something or other, or is carefully fallen down betwixt two rooms, or near the threshold..." (Lilly, CA, p. 203). Below are some locations signified by the individual houses. As you do your own charts, feel free to add to this list to indicate where the item was found.</p>

East Southeast.</p>
<p class="cl-wlefthead">Places Designated by the Elements</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Each of the four elements suggests a particular place or location where a missing object or person may be found.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0236" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Fire signs suggest warm places, where heat is, near chimneys, near walls, near fireplaces, near stoves, or where heat might be generated. Fire locations are also upper rooms and near wall or partitions. Since Mars is a fire planet and his metal, iron, is used to contain heat, an object signified by fire may be near something made of iron or steel. Fire signs imply a position midway up in a room. Their direction is east.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Significators of lost objects in the Via Combusta (burning way) may have a similar meaning to planets in fire signs. The missing item may be near heat, near things connected with heat such as thermostats or furnaces, or near combustion as in an automobile with its combustion engine. Because the Via Combusta spans the ancient sign Scorpio, the lost object may be hidden or near liquids of some kind.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Air signs refer to places high up or upstairs, upper floors, tops of rooms, roofs, eaves, high shelves. Outdoors air signs refer to tree, hillsides, mountain tops, or even in the air as in an airplane. If the significator of the item is in an air sign, it is probably high up in a room. The lost item may be near a window, in a garret, or in some open place with clean, fresh air. Although Aquarius (the Water Bearer) is an air sign, significators in Aquarius often symbolize amphibious places near water (e.g., a Jacuzzi). The direction of air signs is west.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Earth signs show something low or on the floor, at or below the ground level, in the garden, in the yard, possibly in the cellar, or buried in the ground. Outdoors the object may be near a bridge. Earth refers to earthen things, stone, cement, pavement, mud or clay walls, things on the ground, the first floor of a building, the structural elements of things. The direction of earth signs is south.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Water signs imply a location low in a room, near water or other liquids, where moisture is, near fountains, plumbing, bathrooms, sinks, tubs, rivers, lakes, oceans, low lands, low places. The ruler of a lost item in a water sign may mean the item is near water as under a sink, but it also might be near an oil tank, near the gearshift with its transmission fluid in a car, near some containers of cleaning fluid, etc. Cancer refers to pure or running water, Scorpio to filthy liquids, oils, and dyes, and Pisces to standing waters, liquors, and wines. The direction of water signs is north.</p>
<p class="cl-wlefthead">Places Designated by Triplicity</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Common or Mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces) suggest that the missing object is in the house. If outdoors, common signs indicate watery places, ditches, and pits.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) indicate a hidden location, a place low or near the floor. If outdoors, fixed signs signify good quality flat land.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) refer to high places, like roof and ceilings, and to ground that has been recently dug. If outdoors, cardinal signs indicate hills and newly built structures.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">A MODERN EXAMPLE: WHERE ARE RACHEL'S MISSING EYEGLASSES?</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph" id="26H-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">On the morning of September 15, 1992, at 7:21 A.M. EDT, I received a message from my friend Rachel that she would like help locating her missing eyeglasses. Rachel, who shares an office suite with my wife, is a total skeptic of astrology. She had misplaced her rather expensive eyeglasses two days earlier and was calling in desperation because she could not find them. She felt she had nothing to lose by asking the question of an astrologer. I was testing Regiomontanus houses at the time. See Chart 30.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0237" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00067.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 30: Rachel's Eyeglasses September 15, 1992, 7:21 A.M. EDT, 73W01, 41 N19 Regiomontanus Houses</p>
</div>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">I assumed that the early Ascendant reflected Rachel's disbelief that I could be of help, and I decided to read the chart nonetheless. Rachel is represented by 1st house ruler Venus and by the Moon. The missing eyeglasses are signified by 2nd house Venus. The fact that Venus rules both the Ascendant and second house suggests that the missing item is still in Rachel's possession. Furthermore, 2nd ruler Venus lies in the 1st house, suggesting that the glasses are in a place where they are usually kept and perhaps on Rachel's person. Because Venus is separating from squares to Uranus and Neptune, I assumed that Rachel had misplaced the glasses during a period of stress and inattention two days earlier.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="26M-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">According to Lilly, if the 2nd ruler lies in the 1st house, "you may judge the thing is in that part of the house which he himself [the querent] most frequents, or wherein he doth most abide, or is conversant, or where himself layeth up his own commodities" (CA p. 202). This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the Moon (also representing Rachel) lies in Taurus in the 8th (both symbols of places where valuables may be kept) and is approaching a conjunction with the Part of Fortune whose dispositor is Venus in the 1st.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0238" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I assured Rachel that she would find her eyeglasses soon, most likely in a place where she normally keeps them. She decided to wait another day before ordering new glasses. The next afternoon she reached for something in her pocketbook and discovered her missing eyeglasses at the bottom of her purse. Although she had looked through her pocketbook previously, she had not seen them. Remaining true to her skepticism of astrology, Rachel asked my wife if she had found the glasses elsewhere in the office and placed them in her pocketbook to make the chart turn out as predicted!</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">AN HISTORICAL EXAMPLE: THE THEFT OF THE SLAVE GIRL'S LINEN</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">In the year A.D. 478, in Syene (Aswan), somebody stole a slave girl's linen. Distraught, the young maiden consulted her local astrologer, Palchus, who promptly told her where to find it. Fortunately for us, Palchus recorded his analysis and made it available for modern eyes. In Greek Horoscopes Neugebaur and Van Hoesen reported the date of the theft as August 29, 478, during the fourth hour of the night (around 10:30 P.M.), at Syene (32E57 /24N04). See Chart 31. Palchus does not specify a house system, so I used Porphyry, which was a popular third-century system. The fifth-century ephemerides were not as accurate as modern computer generated ones, and the positions given by Palchus vary somewhat from modern calculations.</p>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00068.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 31: Palchus / The Theft of the Slave Girl's Linen August 29, 478, 10:30 P.M. LMT, 32E57, 24N04 Porphyry Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0239" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Because the modern calculations are a degree or two later than Palchus' figures, you might think the date is off by a day or two. The date appears correct, however, because Palchus refers to the theft occurring during the Full Moon. The Moon opposed the Sun shortly before the slave asked the question. Here is a list comparing the modern and older chart positions.</p>
<p class="cl-center3"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0035.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">There is an apparent discrepancy between the fifth century Part of Fortune and the modern computation. Today's formula for Pars Fortuna (Ascendant + Moon - Sun) was used by the ancients only for daytime charts. It represents the point the Moon would occupy if the Sun were rising. This diurnal Part of Fortune computes to Ascendant (28° 08' Taurus) + Moon (12° 09' Pisces) - Sun (7° 07' Virgo), or 58.13 + 342.15 - 157.12 = 243.16, or 3° 11' Sagittarius.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The ancients calculated two Parts of Fortune, one for daytime and the other for nighttime charts. They reasoned that the Sun was lord of the day and the Moon was queen of the night. The formula for the nocturnal Part of Fortune is Ascendant + Sun - Moon. It is the point the Sun would occupy if the Moon were rising on the Ascendant, the most powerful angle in the chart and a fitting place for a ruler to be. At night the ancients placed the Moon on the Ascendant to calculate Pars Fortuna, and during the day they placed the Sun there.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Using the nighttime Part of Fortune, we calculate: (Ascendant) 58.13 + (Sun) 157.12 - (Moon) 342.15 = -126.9. Since we can't have a negative number and are dealing with points on a continuous circle, we must subtract 126.9 from 360 (the number of degrees in a full circle), to get 233.1, or 23° 06' Scorpio. As a good Greek-Egyptian astrologer, Palchus was careful to use the nocturnal Part of Fortune in a 10:30 P.M. chart, four hours after sunset, when the Moon reigned supreme.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Palchus identified the thief and assured the girl that she would soon get her linen back. How did he do this? His reasoning may seem a little odd to the modern horary astrologer, but it shows us how our thinking about finding lost objects evolved. Palchus deduced that the linen was out of sight because the nocturnal Pars Fortuna was in Scorpio, a hidden sign. Recall that the Lot of Fortune is a co-ruler of the 2nd house of money and movable possessions. As ruler of the Ascendant (at 28° Taurus), Venus governs the slave girl who makes the inquiry.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0240" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Palchus noted that both the Sun and the Ascendant-ruler, Venus, applied to a trine with the Ascendant. The Moon, furthermore, was approaching a sextile to the Ascendant. He took these favorable aspects to mean that the thief was a member of the household and that the stolen item would be recovered. The Full Moon was "in contact with the diameter of Saturn." This indicated that "the thief was an old man." Mercury is the natural ruler of thieves. Because Saturn was in Mercury's sign of the Virgin (Virgo), the thief must be "an educated person and a rascal and frustrated in intercourse." Palchus did not hold Virgo in high esteem. He made this comment long before the days of that other educated rascal Richard Nixon, who has Virgo rising, showing his personality and state of mind. Was Nixon also "frustrated in intercourse"? I wonder.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Although Palchus seemed unaware of them, two other horary methods identify Saturn as the thief. First, Saturn at 13° 58' Virgo in the 4th house is a peregrine planet in an angle. Lilly used peregrine planets in angles or in the 2nd house to signify the thief. Mars, ruler of the 7th, is peregrine at 22° 03' Gemini in the 1st house and could represent a thief.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">A rule of Guido Bonatus also fingers Saturn as the thief. Bonatus used the planet from which the Moon most recently separated as a co-ruler of the querent and the planet which the Moon will next aspect as a co-ruler of the quesited. In this chart the Moon's next aspect is an opposition to Saturn. The method of Bonatus identifies Saturn as the quesited thief.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Palchus was using the Egyptian rather than the Ptolemaic terms of the planets, as evidenced by his statement that the Moon (the stolen goods) was in the terms of Venus, showing that the linen belonged to a woman (Venus). The Moon is in the Egyptian terms of Venus but in the Ptolemaic terms of Jupiter. Maybe the ultimate owner of the linen was her master (Jupiter), most likely a corpulent, well-to-do man.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Venus, ruling the querent, is in her fall in Virgo. Palchus reads this to mean that the querent "was a humble person or slave and that the lost article was old and wretched because it (Venus) was in evening phase." Venus was the evening star that day. He next gives his reasons why the linen (the Moon) would be found. First, he says, the Moon is moving from Pisces into Aries, the sign of Mars, and the Moon's next conjunction will be with Mars, which governs the sign that next receives the Moon. Mars is also the dispositor of the Part of Fortune, which Palchus calculated to be in Scorpio. As the dispositor of Pars Fortuna, Mars bears its "likeness" and conveys that good fortune to the Moon in the upcoming conjunction.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Furthermore, the Sun in Virgo will trine the "horoscopos" (Ascendant) in Taurus and will sextile Pars Fortuna in Scorpio. The Sun is also "in company with the ruler of the horo- scopos" (Venus) since both are in Virgo and Venus is separating from a conjunction with the Sun. In addition, the Sun is "diametrical to the Moon" (in Pisces).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">These various indications, Palchus reported, "by every scheme made the finding quick." He added that because the Ascendant ruler (Venus) was in her own "triangle" (Virgo, Capricorn, Taurus) and because Jupiter, ruling the Moon's sign Pisces, had dignity in its own sign Sagittarius, "the finding took place."</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0241" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">A NOTE ABOUT CALENDARS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">To calculate the chart for the slave girl's linen, I had to convert the date and time given in an ancient text to the modern calendar. I ran into a similar problem when I wanted to run the chart for the Dean of Vienne through my computer. If you read Lilly's original examples, you will find that the dates used by Lilly do not match today's Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The West used the Julian calendar from 45 B.C. to A.D. 1582. The Julian calendar placed the vernal equinox at March 25 and set the length of the year to 365.25 days. It also created a leap year every four years to compensate for the extra quarter day each year. Because 365.25 days is not the exact the length of year, the equinox began to move backward in time. At the beginning of the Julian calendar, the spring equinox fell on March 25. By the year A.D. 325 it occurred on March 21, and by 1570 it fell on March 11.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Pope Sixtus IV summoned Regiomontanus to Rome in 1474 to reconstruct the calendar, but Regiomontanus died before completing the task. If only he had done a horary chart before accepting the assignment! A century later a physician from Verona, Aloysius Lilius, worked out the mathematics of a calendar that would accurately time the seasons. Dr. Lil- ius died before he could do much with his system. Fortunately, his brother preserved it and gave it to Pope Gregory XII. Pope Gregory convened a committee that spent five years revising the calendar to the modern one that bears his name. This new calendar dropped 10 days by changing October 5 to October 15, 1582. The length of the solar year was also corrected to 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 12 seconds.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">If you work with old sources, you will need to check your dates and calendars systems to be sure you have accurate information. The Gregorian calendar went into effect in 1582 throughout the Roman Catholic empire, but the Protestant world was slow to accept it. Germany, Denmark, and Sweden waited until 1700, and Russia until 1918. Great Britain did not make the change until 1752. By then the British had to drop 11 days by changing September 3 to September 14, 1752. Lilly's charts are for dates prior to 1752 and require a ten-day correction. Also, in Lilly's time, the convention was to begin the new day at noon rather than at midnight as we do today.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In summary, to convert the older Julian dates to the current Gregorian calendar, do the following. For Julian dates from October 15, 1582 through February 28, 1700, you add ten days; from March 1, 1700 through February 28, 1800, you add eleven days; from March 1, 1800 through Feb 28, 1900, you add twelve days; and from March 1, 1900 through February 28, 2000, you add thirteen days.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">WHICH WAY DID HE Go? DIRECTIONS IN HORARY</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph" id="27K-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Tables 16, 17, and 18 (opposite) present the traditional horary wisdom on locating directions in a chart. Where you find the significator by house and by sign is where the lost object or person will be. Usually the astrologer must synthesize multiple indications into a meaningful statement. Various textbooks give different rules which don't always work out in practice. Reviewing the chart with the querent will often jog his or her memory and bring to light forgotten facts that help in locating the object.</p>

<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Let's see how William Lilly applied these rules to the case of the missing dog. On September 8, 1646, at 4:05 P.M. LMT, a client asked Lilly about a missing dog, "What part of the city they should search? and, should he be found?" See Chart 32.</p>

</div>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">With Capricorn rising and the Moon's South Node (of the nature of Saturn) near the Ascendant, the querent's ruler is Saturn and the querent was saturnine. Lilly described him as "vitiated both in body and mind; that is, he was a little deformed in body, of small stature, and extremely covetous in disposition."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The 6th house rules pets. Some modern astrologers say that if pets are love objects, they belong in the 5th; but this saturnine, covetous, deformed man would hardly keep a dog as a love object. With Gemini on the 6th, Mercury signifies the dog. Looking at Table 16, we see that Gemini, the sign of the cusp of the dog's house, is West by South. Mercury, the dog's significator, is in the 8th house in Libra. The 8th house is WSW and Libra is a western sign.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon is a general significator of runaways and fugitives. Here Luna is at the end of the 7th or just inside the 8th house (Regiomontanus system) and in Virgo. The 7th house is West, the 8th house WSW, and Virgo is South by West. Let's list the various indicators:</p>
<p class="cl-list">• Ruler of quesited (Mercury) by house: 8th-WSW.</p>
<p class="cl-list">• Ruler of quesited (Mercury) by sign: Libra-West</p>
<p class="cl-list" id="282-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">• Sign on cusp of quesited house: Gemini-W by S</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0244" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-list">• Sign of the Moon: Virgo-S by W</p>
<p class="cl-list">• House of the Moon (7th-8th) West to WSW.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Lilly ignored the house positions and considered only the sign placements. Mercury is in Libra (West), Gemini (West by South) is on the cusp of the quesited house, and the Moon is in Virgo (South by West). Lilly concluded that "the plurality of testimonies chewed the dog ought to be west from where the owner lived."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Rarely are the indicators of direction so consistent as in Lilly's case of the missing dog. The astrologer usually has to be creative at synthesis to get the right answer. Because the dog's ruler Mercury was in an air sign, Lilly concluded "the dog was in some garret or upper room; and, as the Moon was under the beams of the Sun, and Mercury, the Moon, and the Sun were in the 8th house, that he was kept privately, or in great secrecy." Like Palchus, Lilly regards Scorpio and the 8th house as symbols of hidden or secret places. Being under the rays of the Sun also hides the light of the Moon. Because the Moon rules fugitives, the hidden Moon signifies the state of the missing dog.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Lilly also experimented with finding lost objects in the home and came up with the following system for locating anything mislaid or missing at home, but not stolen. To find the lost item, he synthesized the eight indicators of direction and location shown in Table 19.</p>
<p class="cl-5tablehead">Table 19:</p>
<p class="cl-5tablehead">Lilly's Eight Indicators for Finding Missing Things</p>
<p class="cl-list1">1. The Ascendant sign.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">2. The sign of the ruler of the Ascendant.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">3. The sign on the 4th house (cardine under the earth).</p>
<p class="cl-list1">4. The sign of the ruler of the 4th.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">5. The sign of the Moon.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">6. The sign on the 2nd cusp (movable possessions).</p>
<p class="cl-list1">7. The sign of the ruler of the 2nd.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">8. The sign of the Part of Fortune.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Different astrologers have different systems for finding lost objects. Joan McEvers looks primarily at the house and sign of the planet ruling the 2nd (movable possessions), and then at the dispositor of the Part of Fortune, if necessary, for further information.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Ivy Jacobson also assigns movable possessions to the 2nd house, but she places the possibility of mislaying objects in the 4th. She has a slightly more elaborate system than McEvers but is less detailed than Lilly. Jacobson considers the following four significators to locate a missing article:</p>
<p class="cl-list">• The ruler of the 2nd (movable possessions)</p>
<p class="cl-list">• The Moon (natural ruler of fugitives)</p>
<p class="cl-list">• Venus (natural ruler of valuables)</p>
<p class="cl-list" id="28O-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">• The dispositor of the Part of Fortune.</p>

<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 33: "Where are My Watch and Ring?" August 8, 1989, 6:49 A.M. EST, 73W01, 41 N19 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I will now give an example to compare these three methods. Chart 33 is for a question of my own. Let's see if we can find the lost object. On August 8, 1989, I was about to leave for work when I could not find my watch and ring. I knew they were at home because I remembered taking them off the previous evening. I quickly searched the usual places I might leave them and they were nowhere to be found. I cast the chart for 6:49 A.M. EST on August 8, 1989, the time I was most solicitous abut the matter.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Let's see if the chart can tell me the location of my watch and ring. The Virgo Ascendant conjoins my natal Part of Fortune. This is a good sign. I should get the items back. Venus is in Virgo in the first house, another good sign, because Venus is benefic and is the natural ruler of rings. Libra is on the 2nd cusp so Venus is also the 2nd house ruler of lost items in this chart. The placement of Venus in the first house confirms that the ring is at home in a place I frequently use or where it ought to be.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">McEvers would look mainly at the position of Venus, ruler of the 2nd. Venus is EAST by mundane house and SOUTH by WEST according to sign. The missing objects ought to be in the east part of the house, southwest corner; or else, in the southwest part of the house, eastern side of the room. The dispositor of Pars Fortuna is Mars which is in Virgo in the 12th. Virgo is S by W, and the 12th is E by SE. The direction S by W is repeated and ought to be a key in finding the watch and ring.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Ivy Jacobson would add the Moon and Venus to McEvers' list. Venus is already the ruler of the 2nd house. The Moon is in the 2nd house, making it a co-ruler of the lost objects. The Moon is also a natural ruler of fugitives and lost things. Unfortunately, here the Moon is in the Via Combusta, one of the classical considerations before judgment. Will I have trouble reading the chart or finding the objects? Will the perverse nature of the combust zone play a sadistic trick on me? We shall see.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0246" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">To review, Jacobson says to look at:</p>
<p class="cl-list">• The ruler of the 2nd-Libra here-Venus.</p>
<p class="cl-list">• Venus (natural ruler of possessions).</p>
<p class="cl-list">• Moon (natural ruler of fugitives).</p>
<p class="cl-list">• Dispositor of the Scorpio Pars Fortuna-Mars.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">According to Jacobson, because the ruler of the 2nd cusp is in the 1st house, the lost items are in the home or where the querent usually keeps such things. She says to use the house positions to find the part of the home to go to first, then to use the sign positions to tell where to go once you get there. The sign's element will designate whether it is low, middle, or high in the location. Let me make a little chart to sort this all out:</p>
<p class="cl-center"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0039.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I already know the watch and ring are at home. I simply don't remember where I put them the previous evening. To find this out, I follow Jacobson's rules and look at house positions first. The houses suggest I should go EAST. This takes me into the living room. Next I consider the sign positions which are predominantly South by West. I look in the southwest corner of the living room. The earth and water signs suggest the missing items are on the floor. Guess what, they're not there! Ivy Jacobson strikes out.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">But wait a minute. I must remain firm in my conviction that the answer is in the chart. Maybe the problem is the Via Combust Moon. Jones said the Via Combusta symbolizes a perverse satisfaction in confusion. Suddenly it occurs to me that the Via Combust Moon may be telling me the chart is deliberately trying to mislead me by representing things backwards and delighting in the resulting chaos.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Let me redo the analysis, this time reversing Jacobson's instructions. Instead of first looking at the house positions, I will read the sign positions. The signs are mainly SOUTH BY WEST so I go to the southwest part of the house which is my bedroom. This makes sense because I usually leave the watch and ring in the bedroom. Venus in the 1st house suggests the objects are at home in a place they normally should be.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Following the perverse symbolism of the Via Combust Moon, I look to the house positions second. These are mainly EAST and then either NORTH or a little SOUTH. I go to the east wall of the bedroom, north corner, and then a little south. Instead of looking on the ground (earth and water signs), I do the opposite. I look up, and there, midway up the wall, is a thermostat, and on the thermostat are my watch and ring. Voila! When I did everything Ivy Jacobson told me to do but exactly backwards, I got the right answer. McEvers would have told me to try either combination of directions, and one of them would have led me to the lost items.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0247" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Let me clarify a trick of my own that is sometimes helpful. To decide the sequence in which to follow directions, I rank-order their prominence in the chart. Among the sign positions, S by W occurs three times, and N by E only once. Thus, I would go S by W first, and then N by E. Looking at the house positions, EAST occurs twice, N by E once, and ESE once. Clearly EAST predominates so I would go to the east wall first. Then it's a toss-up between N by E and ESE. I would go northeast first because the Moon suggests northeast by both house and sign. Finally, I would look slightly south (ESE) from the northeast corner of the eastern wall, and there would be the lost items. In retrospect, it occurred to me that Mars, dispositor of Pars Fortuna, in Virgo fits because Mars rules heat and Virgo rules regulation of climate. The location on the thermostat makes sense.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">What about the Via Combust Moon? Maybe it wasn't so perverse after all. The Moon, as co-ruler of the lost items, in the burning way showed their position on the thermostat which regulates the heat in the home. How literal can symbolism get?</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Now let's see if William Lilly would have found my watch and ring with the eight points he would cover:</p>
<p class="cl-list1">1. The Ascendant sign (Virgo): S by W.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">2. The sign of the Ascendant ruler Mercury (Virgo): S by W.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">3. The sign on the 4th house (Sagittarius): E by S.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">4. The sign of the ruler of the 4th (Cancer): NORTH.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">5. The sign of the Moon (Scorpio): N by E.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">6. The sign on the 2nd cusp (Libra): WEST.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">7. The sign of the ruler of the 2nd (Virgo): S by W.</p>
<p class="cl-list1">8. The sign of the Part of Fortune (Scorpio): N by E.</p>
<p class="cl-fixedcenterreclustered"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0040.svg"/>
</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0248" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">My goodness, this is confusing! What do I do now, William?</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Lilly says if the ruler of the 2nd is in an angle, the item is within the home. Good. I already knew that, but where in the home? Quoth Lilly: "If the Lord of the 2nd be in the Ascendant, or in the sign wherein the Lord of the Ascendant is, or in one of his houses, you may judge the thing is in that part of the house which he himself most frequents, or wherein he doth most abide, or is conversant, or where he layeth his own commodities, or such things as he most delight in." See where Jacobson got her rules? According to Lilly, the misplaced items must be in the bedroom or at my computer desk because these are the places I most frequent and where I usually keep things.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Now to Lilly's compass directions. He takes his eight points, ignores the mundane houses, and uses the quality of the signs to find what part of the house the item is in, "according to the greater number of testimonies." There are three Virgos in the list, more than any other sign, so I should go south and west, back into my bedroom.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Lilly doesn't tell us what to do next so I'll follow my own rule of sequencing directions in order of their prominence in the chart. The second most prominent sign, Scorpio, which tells me to go northeast, and also takes me to the thermostat. Maybe the Moon and Part of Fortune in Scorpio refer to the bathroom on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In summary, Lilly took me to the thermostat directly, McEvers gave me the correct location as one of two possibilities, and Jacobson led me astray unless I reversed her directions in accord with the perverse nature of the Via Combust Moon.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Before going on to the next chapter, test yourself with the following horary quiz.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">A QUIZ FOR THE READER</p>
<p class="cl-wlefthead">Question: Where is my missing wallet? (Chart 34)</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Study the chart on the next page before reading the answer, which is inverted at the bottom of this page. No cheating!</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Hint: Cancer rises so the Moon represents the querent. Leo on the 2nd cusp indicates that the Sun symbolizes the wallet. Moon applies to a trine of the Sun: the wallet will return. Sun in Gemini (transportation) in the 11th suggests a southeast direction. Mars disposes the Part of Fortune and thus also represents the wallet. The Moon (the querent) is separating from an opposition with Mars (the wallet), showing their recent separation. Mars (the wallet) has just completed a trine to the Ascendant (querent), indicating that he found his wallet shortly before asking the question. The late Ascendant often occurs when the querent already knows the answer and is just asking a horary question "to see what the stars will say."</p>
