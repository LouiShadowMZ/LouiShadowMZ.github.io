 estern astrology is an amalgam of diverse and often conflicting traditions. We saw in a previous chapter, for example, how the decanates of the zodiac signs received one set of rulerships from the Chaldeans and another from the Hindus. Traditional horary stuck with the Chaldean system, but modern natal astrologers prefer the wisdom of India.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">THE JOYS OF THE PLANETS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">The joys of the planets are yet another set of planetary assignments to houses and signs that was assimilated into Western astrology. One tradition appointed the same planet to govern both a mundane house and its corresponding sign of the zodiac. Another tradition assigned each of the seven classical planets to the mundane house where it especially rejoiced. In addition, the classical planets rejoice in certain signs. According to Lilly, "Aquarius is the joy of Saturn, Sagittarius of Jupiter, Scorpio of Mars, Libra of Venus, Virgo of Mercury" (CA, p. 176).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Below is a list of planetary joys derived from the fourth century text of Firmicus Maternus and the work of William Lilly.</p>
<p class="cl-center"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0026.svg"/>
</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0210" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Mercury is the natural ruler of communication and concretely of the tongue. The 1st house governs the physical body and specifically the head because of its association with Aries and Mars. Mercury rejoices in the 1st house because the tongue enjoys being in the head. If you know anyone with a 1st house Mercury, check to see how they love to talk.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon governs the trivial happenings of everyday life. The 3rd house also rules taken-for-granted daily trotting and trudging. The Moon joys in the 3rd because it shares with the 3rd house dominion over local travel and humdrum happenstance.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Moderns like to think of Venus as a goddess of pure love. To the ancient Greeks and Romans she was rather a floozy, given to self-indulgence and the pleasures of the flesh. Because of her party-going and artistic nature, Venus rejoices in the 5th house of fun, enjoyment, sensuality, and creativity.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Mars, the lesser malefic, likes to make people suffer. He does this partly through sickness, fevers, inflammations, cuts, injuries, accidents, and epidemics. Because he enjoys inflicting bodily suffering, Mars grows ecstatic in the 6th house of illness, upset, and distress. Mars also symbolizes the human energy needed to do the laborious drudgery of the 6th house.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Maternus called the 9th the house of the "Sun god." The Sun does well here because the 9th house, like the Sun, has the nature of fire. The 9th is also in trine aspect with the other two fire houses, the 1st, where the Sun is exalted, and the 5th which the Sun rules.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Some authors also feel the Sun rejoices in the 10th house, or at least is especially fortunate there. Here Maternus locates "life and vital spirit," both naturally signified by the Sun. Sol governs kings, presidents, honor, preferment, promotion, and success-all 10th house matters. As king of the universe, it is only fair that the Sun should rejoice in two houses, the 9th and the 10th. Jupiter also does well in the 10th.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The ancients, including Ptolemy, called the 11th the house of the Good Daemon and regarded it as especially fortunate. It was only natural to assign Jupiter, the greater benefic, to this house because Jupiter signifies prosperity, expansion, and good luck.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Finally, the ancients regarded the 12th as the house of the Evil Daemon. The 12th and the 6th houses were the two most unfortunate places around the wheel. Which planet most loves misery? Saturn, of course. Saturn delights in the suffering, self-undoing, sacrifice, suicide, assassinations, secret enemies, karma, widowhood, grief, sorrow, hospitalization, limitations, and confinement of thel2th. He couldn't be happier anywhere else in the chart.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">SOME NOTES ABOUT THE SIGNS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph" id="1SJ-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Astrologers usually divide the twelve signs into groups according to the four elements (fire, earth, air, and water) and the three qualities (cardinal, fixed, and mutable). The fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) are outgoing, energetic, self-assertive, forceful, positive, adventurous, and active. The earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) are conservative, methodical, down to earth, stable, concrete, practical, and solid. The air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) are intellectual, like to make connections, sociable yet detached, indecisive, fond of abstractions, and like to communicate. The water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) are intuitive, receptive, sensitive, moody, quiet, reticent, sympathetic, protective, secret, occult, and deep.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0211" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In addition to their elemental qualities, the signs can act in one of three modes: Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable. These are often called the three Qualities of the signs and derive from the Gunas of Hindu philosophy. Each quality (or quadrature) consists of four signs, one for each element.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Cardinal or Movable signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) are the signs of the solstices and equinoxes that initiate the four seasons of the year. Cardinal signs are initiatory, directly involved, quick to act, decisive, powerful, energetic, and enterprising. They take the lead and like to manifest in the world. A prominence of cardinality in a horary chart shows a quick resolution of the matter.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius), as the middle signs of the four seasons, are "middle-of-the-road," stable, stubborn, deliberate, determined, persistent, organized, goal-oriented, conservative, and set in their ways. They are slow to change but, when they do, the change is often drastic. Much fixity in a horary chart shows conditions that are entrenched and hard to alter.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Mutable or Common signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces), as the ending signs of the four seasons-getting ready to make the change-are adaptable, flexible, pliant, impartial, clever, mentally alert, mercurial, and interested in people and relationships. They prefer to write or study about action rather than engage in it. Prominent mutability in a horary chart suggests changeable or unstable conditions in which the querent will need to follow the lead or bend to the needs of others. Table 11 shows the relationship between Modes or Qualities and the Elements among the signs.</p>
