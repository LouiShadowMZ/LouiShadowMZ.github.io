<h1 class="cl-chaptername">Fixed Stars and Malefic Degrees</h1>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Below is a list of fixed stars that are referenced in the horary literature. William Lilly used about fifty fixed stars in Christian Astrology. In the following list, the letter L after the star indicates that the star was used by Lilly. The letter R after the name identifies that star as important according to the research of Diana Rosenberg. The planets whose names are capitalized are those cataloged by Ptolemy. Planets in parentheses describe the nature of the star according to the research of Diana K. Rosenberg. The fixed stars move forward in the zodiac about fifty seconds of arc per year. In ten years, the fixed stars advance about eight minutes and twenty-one seconds of arc. On average, every seventy-two years these stars move forward in the zodiac an entire degree (by apparent motion).</p>
