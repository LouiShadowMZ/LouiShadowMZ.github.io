 hile I was in the midst of writing the first edition of this book, the universe provided me with a jarring opportunity to test the horary hypothesis. I wrote this book in bits and pieces whenever I could find a few minutes of free time. As a true Virgo, I discovered the most efficient way to get writing done was to carry my materials with me in a briefcase. If time opened in my daily schedule, I could research a reference, revise a chapter, or work on a chart.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">On Wednesday, November 29, 1989, I was late for a 10:00 A.M. meeting at the hospital. I got to the parking lot a few minutes after 10:00, quickly parked the car, and rushed to the meeting. When I returned to the car an hour later, I found the window smashed and two briefcases missing. Gone were my appointment book and office papers, the entire first draft of this book, several textbooks and journals, and sundry other valuables. Needless to say, I was agitated and depressed about the loss of many hours of work, and annoyed with myself for being so careless. Fortunately most of the text of this book was in the computer. Irreplaceable were the hours of research notes I had not yet had time to enter into the word processor.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The hospital is in an inner city neighborhood, known for its crack addicts, and I assumed the thief was one of the young men who hung out on the street near the hospital. I knew of others who had been robbed and who had found their pocketbooks or briefcases in garbage dumpsters nearby. Hoping the thieves would not care for my notes, I began to search the neighborhood. Suddenly it occurred to me to do a horary chart. At 11:23 A.M., I looked at my watch and asked the question, "Where are my papers, where is the thief, and will I get my things back?"</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2B7-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">For the next several days I was busy getting the car window repaired, changing the locks (because they stole my spare car keys), calling the police, contacting the insurance company, and doing myriad other things you need to do after a robbery. I felt incredibly discouraged about the disappearance of my research and despaired of ever seeing it again. Feeling hopeless, I did not erect the horary chart until the weekend.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0251" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">When I finally turned on the computer, the first thing I checked was Wednesday's transits to my natal chart. On 11/29/89 transiting Mercury in Sagittarius was in my 3rd house of cars and documents exactly opposite Uranus in Gemini (of cars and documents) in my 9th house of books and publications. Transiting Mars in Scorpio in my 2nd house of possessions and money had recently formed an exact quincunx to my natal Uranus in the 9th. If I had noticed these transits before the Wednesday meeting at the hospital, I would have been more careful with my briefcase and automobile. In addition, this was the week that Mars by solar arc direction was conjoining natal Pluto.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Chart 35 for my question has a void of course Moon in Sagittarius. According to Bonatus and Lilly, the Moon can perform when void of course in Sagittarius, but I still felt I should be cautious in reading the chart.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The presence of the Moon's North Node and the Part of Fortune in the 1st house was encouraging. As they approached the Ascendant, these two benefic influences seemed to promise some good was coming my way.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The angles were mixed with fixed Aquarius rising and mutable Sagittarius on the MC. I took this to mean that matters would initially seem entrenched and hopeless but that things would change and develop rapidly after a while. The end of the matter 4th house has mutable Gemini on the cusp, making Mercury ruler of the final outcome. Mercury is in his detriment in Sagittarius, but is strong in the 10th house and is in his own Ptolemaic terms. I interpreted this to mean I might get some things back but not others.</p>

<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 35: The Theft of This Book November 29, 1989, 11:23 A.M. EST, 72W55, 41 n18 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0252" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">My usual practice is to use traditional rulerships for Scorpio, Aquarius, and Pisces. In this chart the modern rulerships for the 1st and 2nd houses also seemed to fit the situation. Aquarius on the 1st cusp represents me, the querent. Saturn, the traditional ruler of Aquarius, described how depressed I felt about the theft. Uranus also fit because I was agitated and shaken up by the theft of my astrology (Uranus) notes. Should I use Saturn or Uranus as my primary ruler? The chart would have to guide me. The Moon, as usual, was my co-ruler.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Pisces is on the 2nd cusp of movable goods. Jupiter, the traditional ruler of Pisces, is retrograde in Cancer in the 5th house. Jupiter's retrograde condition implied the missing objects would return. On the other hand, Neptune (dishonesty) might better describe my pilfered notes and books on horary. Neptune is in Capricorn in the 11th, between Uranus and Saturn. In addition, Aries is intercepted in the 2nd house, making Mars a co-ruler of the lost items. In questions of missing or stolen goods, the Moon is often a co-significator of the lost items.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">At this point the chart was appearing incredibly complicated. I wasn't sure if I should use the traditional or modern rulerships. I looked to the chart to guide me. Saturn (me) had just left a conjunction to Neptune (the goods). I had carelessly left my briefcase in a parked car in a bad neighborhood. The symbolism fit. retrograde Jupiter (the goods) had also just passed an opposition to Saturn (me). I had recently been separated from my goods. This symbolism was also apt.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">At some future time Jupiter would turn direct and again oppose Saturn. The turning direct could mean a return of the goods, but the second opposition to Saturn could signify a final loss or separation. Here was a mixed message and a classic case of good and bad news. Uranus, my co-ruler, would eventually conjoin Neptune (the goods). They were seven degrees apart. Did this mean I would be reunited with my property in seven hours, seven days, seven weeks...?</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">My primary traditional ruler Saturn was strong in his own sign Capricorn and his own 11th house. My modern co-ruler Uranus was also at home in the 11th. Jupiter (the lost items) was in his dignity in Cancer and well-placed in the 5th, a fire house. These dignities seemed to imply I would get some things back.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">What about the thief? The ruler of the 7th and peregrine planets in angles or in the 2nd house designate the thief. With Leo on the 7th cusp, the Sun ruled the thief. Usually the Sun signifies men aged thirty-five to forty-five. This puzzled me because the addicts I'd seen on the street looked like they were in their mid to late twenties, more fitting the planet Mars. Sol was strong in Sagittarius, a fire sign, and in the 10th where he rejoices. I concluded that a Solar man, around forty years old, had broken into my car and would get away with it.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon, a feminine planet, was peregrine at 21Â° 46' Sagittarius in the angular 10th. A woman was also involved. The Moon (female thief) and Jupiter (the goods) were in mutual reception. The Solar man who broke into my car must have passed some of the goods (Jupiter) to a woman accomplice (the Moon). Mutual receptions may show a change of location.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Because the stolen items had three rulers-Jupiter, Neptune, and Mars-they may have been divided three ways. The complicated indications of the chart were beginning to give a plausible, though not provable, explanation.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0253" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The chart confirmed some of the information I already knew about my stolen checkbook. I had called the bank about my missing checks and discovered that a woman named Deborah B had forged my name to a check within hours of the robbery and cashed it at a branch of my bank in a neighboring town to the southwest. When I reported the forgery to the police, the detective said, "Oh, Debbie B , she does a lot of this stuff."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">My reading thus far was that I would get some things back but not others. The male thief would get away with it. The bank's location indicated that the checkbook went southwest, which was the house direction of Mars. I took this to mean that Mars represented the stolen checkbook and appointment book which were together in the same wallet. Because Mars was in Scorpio, I assumed Debbie B had thrown my check register and appointment book into the garbage (Scorpio). I would probably never see those things again.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I wanted to know in what direction the other goods might be so I could search for them. With this in mind, I made the following list:</p>
<p class="cl-center4"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0042.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I included all the planets ruling the 2nd house, the dispositor of the Part of Fortune, Venus as natural ruler of possessions, the Moon as natural ruler of fugitives, and Mercury and the 3rd house ruler as natural signifiers of books and papers since these were the specific items I was looking for. Because Taurus is on the 3rd cusp of papers, I counted Venus twice. I gave Mars less weight because he rules an intercepted sign. The evidence also suggested that Mars ruled the checkbook but not the missing papers.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The most commonly occurring sign is earthy Capricorn. The thieves most likely threw my briefcases on the ground in a southeast location, possibly near water because of the prominence of the water signs Cancer and Scorpio. They probably first brought the briefcases to an upstairs room (Sagittarius) to search for valuables.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The preponderance of indicators suggested that I look south and east of the parking lot. The dual rulership of Pisces on the 2nd continued to bother me. Jupiter was north or NNW, and Neptune was south or SSE. Depending on which ruler was primary, I search in exactly opposite directions. The majority of indicators agreed with Neptune, but this contradicted my usual horary practice of using Jupiter as the traditional ruler of Pisces.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2C0-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">I stuck with my hypothesis that the mutual reception meant the crook first went northwest in the direction of Jupiter (primary ruler) and then switched locations (mutual reception with Moon) and ended up southeast in the direction of Neptune. This made sense because the 5th house rules parks and playgrounds, and there is a school playground across the street from the scene of the crime, just northwest of the parking lot. The southeast part of the parking lot has a high fence that would be difficult to scale.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0254" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">To summarize my hypothesis: the thief or thieves broke into the car, ran to the playground first, and then went south and east to an upstairs room (Sagittarius) where they took what they wanted and threw the rest away on the ground level (Capricorn). On Monday morning I left for work early and drove around the neighborhood southeast of the parking lot. My briefcases and papers were nowhere to be found. I had decided to post a reward for the missing papers on the theory that a drug addict had stolen them and would have no use for astrology notes. I was hoping he would exchange them for cash. I spoke to the owner of a small grocery store who knew the local population. He agreed to post the notice and act as a go-between in paying the reward, no questions asked.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The decision to post a reward on Monday was based partly on reading the chart and partly on common sense and desperation. The chart implied that I would hear something in six or seven days. To explain how I read this, I need to discuss the timing of events in horary.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">There are two ways to time events in horary. The first is to see how long an aspect will take to perfect in the ephemeris. This method is the same as using transits to time events from a natal chart. The day the aspect perfects in the ephemeris is the day the event described by the aspect will manifest.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The second method is a symbolic system which equates the number of degrees before the aspect becomes exact to the number of hours, days, weeks, months, years, or other unit of time. Both methods can be used in conjunction, and neither is accurate all of the time. In the symbolic system, the unit of time is determined by the sign and house position of the faster planet that is about to make an aspect.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Tables 20 and 21 list the traditional system. In practice, you can't be too literal about the time units given in the tables. Common sense and the general feel of the chart are the best guides.</p>

<div class="calibre3" id="page0255" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Back to the theft. I thought something would happen regarding my stolen goods in six or seven days for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="cl-list">â¢ The Ascendant would conjoin the Moon's North Node in six degrees.</p>
<p class="cl-list">â¢ Uranus, co-ruler of the 1st, would conjoin Neptune, co-ruler of the 2nd, in seven degrees.</p>
<p class="cl-list">â¢ Jupiter, although retrograde, would eventually turn direct and oppose Saturn. They were three degrees apart. I would soon learn about being separated (opposition) from some of my belongings.</p>
<p class="cl-list">â¢ The Moon, my co-ruler, was less than a degree from a semi-sextile to Venus, my possessions. Semi-sextiles are 2nd house aspects.</p>
<p class="cl-list">â¢ The Moon would conjoin Venus on Saturday, December 2, ephemeris time.</p>
<p class="cl-list">â¢ The Moon would conjoin the Ascendant on Monday, December 4, ephemeris time and would conjoin the North Node and the Part of Fortune later that day by transit.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Because of these favorable transits of the Moon to the horary chart, I decided to post the reward notice on Monday. I noticed that the transiting Moon would sextile transiting Mercury Monday morning. I elected to post the notice a few minutes before this sextile became exact. My reasoning was that the Moon represented me, Mercury my papers, and the sextile the opportunity for their return.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">About an hour later I got a phone call from the manager of the grocery store. A woman who lived in the neighborhood saw my notice and reported seeing the briefcases on the grounds of the public housing project two blocks southeast of the parking lot. She thought the police had picked them up.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I felt elated and immediately called the police who said they did not have the briefcases in their possession. I felt dejected again, but not for long. In the afternoon mail, I received a letter from the police saying they had my briefcases. The officer I spoke to in the morning was mistaken. I got back my astrology notes and books from the police later that day. All the valuables were missing, of course, and so were my checkbook and my appointment book with my entire schedule for 1989.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The public housing project where the police found my stolen goods consists of a set of buildings with garages on the ground level, and three stories of apartments above. As the chart suggested, the thief had most likely taken the briefcases to his upstairs apartment and thrown the unwanted contents on the ground below.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">My astrology notes were irreplaceable and I was ecstatic about finding them. I would have to re-purchase the material things that were stolen. My 1989 schedule would be a pain to reconstruct but with due Virgo diligence I could do just that.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">About two weeks later my secretary saw another robbery occurring outside the window of her office which is next to the parking lot. A forty to forty-five-year-old man smashed in the window of a car, stole some goods, and quickly ran off in a northwest direction. The modus operandi was identical to the theft of my briefcase, and I can only guess that the same man did both thefts and the chart was correct in giving the age of the thief.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2CN-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">And what about the Part of Fortune in the 1st house? Did something good come to the querent as it approached the Ascendant? Perhaps the material for this chapter was the fortunate outcome.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0256" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">THE CASE OF THE MISSING EYEGLASS CASE</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">I would now like to present a case that shows the usefulness of color symbolism in the horary chart. On September 10, 1989, a Sunday, at 9:24 A.M. EST, my wife, though skeptical about astrology, asked me to do a chart to find her missing eyeglass case. She had searched for several days and could not find it. See Chart 36.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The horary question is, "Where is my missing eyeglass case?" The querent is my wife, Linda. The Ascendant at 3Â° 25' Scorpio is in the Via Combusta and warns that the astrologer might have some difficulty reading the chart. Perhaps the Via Combust Ascendant refers to the perverse satisfaction my wife would take in proving astrology wrong. On the other hand, when the chart is radical, activity in the Via Combusta will somehow describe the situation. Maybe my wife was burned up about losing her eyeglass case, or maybe the lost object burned in a fire or is near something that has to do with combustion.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The 2nd house ruler is Jupiter in Cancer (exalted) in the 9th. There are no other planets ruling the 2nd house. As the primary ruler of the missing item, Jupiter, by house, suggests Linda lost it south and slightly west of her current location. Because Jupiter is in the 9th house, she might have lost it on a trip, possibly related to education. We had recently returned from a long-distance (9th house) summer vacation, but Linda remembered having the eyeglass case after we returned. Not long before Linda's question, I had heard a lecture by Joan McEvers about the use of colors of the planets, signs, and houses to help locate objects. I decided to try this method here. According to Lilly and Simmonite, Jupiter's colors are red mixed with green, also ash; and Cancer's colors are green or russet. The 9th house is green and white.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0258" title="pagetype_txt"></div>

<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 36 "Where Is My Missing Eyeglass Case?" September 10, 1989, 9:24 P.M. EST, 73W01, 41 N19 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0259" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I asked my wife if she had traveled anywhere south and west and put her eyeglass case near something red, green, white, or ash. She suddenly recalled dropping her pocketbook the week before when she took our son to "get acquainted day" at kindergarten. The school is southwest of our home. From my son's point of view the trip to kindergarten was a 9th house matter.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">My wife drives a red car with an ash interior. When she arrived, the parking lot was full so the school guard directed her to park in the field next to the school. As she got out of her red car with its ash interior, she dropped her pocketbook onto the green grass. Some white tissues also fell out. The spilling of the pocketbook fit exactly the color scheme suggested by the chart. Maybe that's where she lost the eyeglass case.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I studied the chart for other clues. Here's the Jacobson list of significators:</p>
<p class="cl-center5"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0045.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Jacobson says to follow the houses first and then the signs. The houses are mainly north and east. Going northeast in my home takes me into the living room. The signs are mainly south Capricorn. Going south from the living room takes me into the garage.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon and the dispositors (Saturn and Uranus) of the Part of Fortune, which is at 29Â° Aquarius in the 4th, are in the 3rd house of local trips, early education, garages, and automobiles. Third house colors are red and yellow. Capricorn's colors are black and dark brown, and Capricorn signifies dark places near the ground. My wife's red car is in the garage. I searched the car, looking carefully under all the seats, but found no eyeglass case.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Several aspects in the chart, however, suggest Linda will get the lost item back. Saturn, dispositor of Pars Fortuna, is retrograde, implying a return of her possession. Saturn is dignified in Capricorn and when he turns direct will be six degrees away from a sextile to Pluto, co-ruler of the querent in the 1st house. Jupiter, exalted at 7Â° Cancer, is six degrees from a trine to Linda's co-ruler Pluto, which is dignified at 13Â° Scorpio. Jupiter and Saturn are both cardinal and cadent; Pluto is fixed and angular. It will take six weeks to find the missing object.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The cluster of planets in the 3rd house makes me think she lost it in the car, in the garage, or on a short trip. Because the 3rd house planets are all in Capricorn, the eyeglass case is probably in a dark place near the floor. The Part of Fortune itself at 29Â° Aquarius suggests she may have dropped it behind something. The Moon, her co-ruler, has recently separated from Neptune, showing her carelessness in dropping her pocketbook. Saturn (her possessions) is also moving away from a conjunction with Neptune, reinforcing this interpretation.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0260" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">All the significators of the missing eyeglass case are cadent. The lost item is probably hidden, out of sight, and will be difficult to find. It will be found only indirectly and possibly by another person. The majority of significators are in earth or water signs. The case is low or at ground level, and may be near water or fluids of some kind.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The outcome: Six weeks later my wife left a message on my office answering machine. There was amusement and disbelief in her voice. She had found her eyeglass case in her car with its combustion engine. She dropped a pen down between the gear shift and the side of the front passenger seat. When she reached to pull out the pen, she found her eyeglass case hidden deep in the ash colored fabric between the seat and the gear shift containing fluid). She suspected me of finding the case elsewhere and planting it in her car. To this day she takes perverse satisfaction in teasing me about placing the eyeglass case in her car. I swear I had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Next let's consider a classic horary chart from none other than Nostradamus</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">NOSTRADAMUS AND THE CASE OF THE MISSING CHURCH SILVER</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">In February of 1562 (two centuries before Lilly wrote Christian Astrology), the bishop of the Cathedral Church of Orange, France, asked Nostradamus to help find some stolen goods. It seems that a thief or thieves had absconded with the cathedral's silver, which included a precious and irreplaceable antique chalice. A rumor was circulating that the stolen goods were in Avignon, a region to the west of the Cathedral.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Nostradamus cast a horary chart for the time he understood the question: February 3, 1562, at 6:39 P.M., 48N50 / 02E30. See Chart 37. It was a Mars day during a Jupiter hour. Nostradamus was residing in Salon-de-Crau, Provence at that time, but he used the Regiomontanus tables for Paris, France.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Modern calculations give us slightly different planetary positions than those used by Nostradamus. Listed below is a comparison of the current and the 1562 planetary data:</p>
<p class="cl-center"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0046.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph" id="2DI-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Nostradamus wrote to the bishop that the thief was a "brother of the church with a warlike nature." The thief had not acted alone but had a partner in crime-another of the church brothers. According to Nostradamus' reading of the horary chart, these thieving church brothers had concealed the stolen silver in their houses and were planning to melt it before selling it. Nostradamus added that the rumor about Avignon was false, and in fact the rumor was being spread by the thieves to deflect suspicion from the fact that it was an inside job.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0261" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Nostradamus does not give the astrological details of how he read the chart. He was, however, familiar with the horary literature and used traditional principles to interpret his charts. Let us apply the standard horary rules to see how Nostradamus arrived at his conclusions.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">As usual, the Ascendant, its rulers, and any planets in the 1st house signify the querent. In this chart with a Virgo Ascendant, Mercury represents the bishop who is asking the question. In Lilly's point system (CA, p. 115) Mercury receives seventeen points and is the most dignified planet in the chart. A well-fortified Mercury "represents a man of subtle and political mind, and cogitation, an excellent debater or logician, arguing with learning and discretion, and using much eloquence in his speech" (CA, p. 77). This dignified Mercury in celibate Virgo is probably descriptive of the bishop who asked for Nostradamus' assistance.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon in a horary chart is a co-signifier of the querent. Here the Moon lies in the 6th house of distress and worry, symbolizing the state of the bishop. In addition, the Moon is combust the Sun, indicating the bishop's difficulty with finding the hidden treasure. The Moon is also a natural signifier of silver ("the silvery Moon") and its combustion must have led Nostradamus to conclude that the thieves wanted to melt down the silver by subjecting it to combustion.</p>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00075.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 37: Nostradamus-Stolen Silver February 3, 1562, 6:39 P.M. GMT, 02E30, 48N50 Regiomontanus Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0262" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Moveable goods are shown by the 2nd house, its rulers and planets therein, and by the dispositor of the Part of Fortune. Here Libra rules the 2nd cusp and Saturn is Almuten of the 2nd. Thus, Venus and Saturn may also represent the stolen silver. Furthermore, the possessions of the 9th house cathedral are shown by its second house which is the 10th house of the radical chart. Mercury disposits the Virgo Part of Fortune. In addition, Gemini lies on the cusp of the 10th and Saturn occupies the 10th. Thus, both Mercury and Saturn may represent the stolen goods. In summary, possible rulers of the stolen silver are: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Saturn. The planet Saturn is a likely candidate to rule the ancient and priceless silver chalice. Saturn being retrograde suggests that the chalice will return.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Furthermore, because Mercury rules both the bishop (as Ascendant ruler) and the missing silver (as 10th ruler and dispositor of Pars Fortuna), it seems likely that the silver will return to the bishop. This interpretation is strengthened by the mutual reception between Saturn (the ancient chalice) in Gemini and Mercury (the bishop) in Capricorn. In addition, the Part of Fortune conjoins the Ascendant-another argument for the church's fortune returning to the inquiring bishop.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Who is the thief? The traditional rule is that peregrine planets in the angles or in the 2nd house can represent the thief. This chart has no less than six peregrine (totally undignified) planets: Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In the radical chart, only Saturn in the 10th in Gemini lies in an angle.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Nostradamus, however, says there is more than one thief. He undoubtedly used the turned chart with the 9th house of the cathedral as the new 1st house of the turned chart. If we consider the radical 9th to be the new first house, then the peregrine planets in angles of the turned chart are: Mars and Jupiter in the radical 9th (turned 1st), and the Sun in the radical 6th (turned 10th). Based on the turned chart, Nostradamus wrote to the bishop that the stolen silver was "to be divided among canons who are at present acting like soldiers" (peregrine Mars); and of the thieves, "there were only three, and they brothers of the church" (Leoni, p. 769).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">To retrieve the stolen silver, Nostradamus advised the bishop to cite his authority as an astrologer of renown and to read the following passage to the congregation:</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">"...rest assured, my venerable Lords, if that which was stolen is not brought back one way or another, that they [the thieves] will die the most miserable death, more lingering and more violent and of more inconceivable intensity than ever before occurred-unless everything is restored and replaced in its ancient repository..." (Leoni: Nostradamus and His Prophecies, Bell Publishing Company, 1982, p. 771).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Unfortunately, we have no record of whether the stolen silver was ever returned to the cathedral. If any reader should visit the Cathedral of Orange, France, please let me know how it turned out.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">DISTANCES IN HORARY ASTROLOGY</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph" id="2E2-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">One of the less believable claims of horary is the ability to calculate the distance between the querent and a missing object or person. This involves considering the celestial latitude of the significator of the missing item or person and the cardinality of the sign it occupies. Presumably, zero latitude means a short distance, north latitude a bit farther, and south latitude farther still. Significators in angular signs are close to the querent, in succedent signs farther, and in cadent signs the farthest. Both Simmonite and Jacobson give specific measures of distance for computational purposes. I have not found these measures particularly reliable.</p>
