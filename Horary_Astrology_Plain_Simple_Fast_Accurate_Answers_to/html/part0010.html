<p class="cl-dropcapparagraph"><img alt="" class="calibre5" src="../resources/00030.jpeg"/>
 hen I first started doing horary, I did not pay close attention to the orbs of aspects. Instead, influenced by Joan McEvers and Marc Edmund Jones, I followed the modern rule that planets, by and large, may not leave their original signs in the horary chart to complete an aspect. Instead of orbs, I used the teaching of Jones that "the first aspect made by a significant planet is the normal basis of judgment." Over the past several years I have been impressed by the teaching and research of Sue Ward, Carol Wiggers, C. J. Puotinen, Robert Zoller, Robert Hand, and the scholars of ARHAT. As a result, I now pay more attention to orbs in horary.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">ORBS IN HORARY: EXACT, PERFECT, PARTILE, AND PLATIC ASPECTS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">"Orb" comes from the Latin orbis, meaning circle. According to the modern definition, the orb of an aspect is the number of degrees during which the aspect between two planets remains in effect. In classical astrology, the orbs belong to planets rather than to aspects. To understand the traditional meaning of orbs, we must first consider the classical ideas of exact, perfect, partile, and platic aspects. Let me define these concepts.</p>
<p class="cl-wlefthead">Exact Aspect</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">An aspect is "exact" when the centers of the aspecting bodies are exactly as far apart as specified by the aspect (to the nearest degree, minute, and second). For example, Venus at 9° 25' 17" Leo is exactly trine Jupiter at 9° 25' 17" Aries.</p>
<p class="cl-wlefthead">Perfect Aspect</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">An aspect is "perfect" when there are points on the bodies of the aspecting planets that lie exactly as far apart as the angular distance specified by the aspect. Lilly allowed planets a radius of three minutes of arc, and the lights (Sun and Moon) a radius of almost seventeen minutes. A perfect aspect is exact within an "orb" of the sum of the radii of the two aspecting planets. For example, Venus at 9° 28' Leo is in perfect trine with Jupiter at 9° 23' Aries because they are only five minutes apart and some point on the body of Venus lies exactly trine some point on the body of Jupiter. Also, the Moon at 17° 40' Cancer is "in perfect trine" with the Sun at 17° 24' Pisces (Lilly, CA, p.391) because there exists a point on the Moon's body that is exactly 120 degrees from some point on the Sun's body.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0113" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-wlefthead">Partile Aspect</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">According to Lilly, "When two planets are exactly so many degrees (italics mine) from each other as make a perfect aspect: as if Venus be in 9 degrees of Aries and Jupiter in 9 degrees of Leo, this is a partile trine; so the Sun in one degree of Taurus and the Moon in one degree of Cancer make a partile sextile" (CA, p. 106). An aspect is partile (from the Latin pars for part) when the aspecting planets occupy the same numerical degree of their respective signs. The idea behind partile aspects is that each sign of the zodiac is divided into thirty special "parts" called degrees. When planets are in partile aspect, the degrees of the zodiac occupied by the aspecting planets are exactly as far from one another as specified by the aspect. For example, Venus at 9° 01' Leo is in partile trine with Jupiter at 9° 59' Aries because they are both in 9 degrees of their respective signs. For casting horary charts, Lilly used "whole degrees without sensible error" for the positions of the planets. In partile aspects, the planets share in the aspect formed by the zodiac degrees in which they lie.</p>
<p class="cl-wlefthead">Platic Aspect</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">An aspect is platic (from the Greek platys, meaning broad or flat) when it is within orb and the aspecting planets occupy different degrees of their respective signs. The planets are within orb of forming an aspect, but the degrees in which those planets lie do not form that exact aspect. Platic aspects are more broad-based than partile ones. For example, Venus at 9° 01' Leo is in platic trine with Jupiter at 1° 59' Aries because they are in orb but occupy different degrees of their respective signs.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Lilly did not share the modern preoccupation with being precise to the nearest degree, minute, and second. Partile aspects are exact to the degree, disregarding minutes and seconds. In erecting charts for horary questions, Lilly advised (CA, p. 44) that "the place of the planets ought to be rectified to the hour of the setting of the figure, especially the place of the Moon, because of her swift motion; in the planets you need not be scrupulous, but take whole degrees without sensible error." In charts of nativities, Lilly was more careful in his calculations: "in nativities, you are to have the places of them [the planets] exactly to degrees and minutes; and above all the motion of the Sun to minutes and seconds."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="13G-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">The degree of the zodiac where the aspect becomes partile resembles the epicenter of an earthquake. The force of a quake, or of an aspect, radiates out from the degree of exactitude (epicenter) over an orb of influence, a concentric circle extending in all directions. In traditional horary, the radius of this circle is called the moiety (see below). Aspects gradually decrease in power as the planets move farther away from the aspect's "epicenter" or degree of exactitude. For example, if two planets are 5° apart, most astrologers consider them within orb of a conjunction. Two planets are exactly conjunct when they are exactly zero degrees apart and share the same degree of longitude on the ecliptic. The influence of the conjunction is felt up to ten degrees around the zero degree point of exactitude.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0114" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Orbs are important in natal astrology because people rarely have partile aspects in their birth charts. By using orbs, the astrologer can determine which aspects are likely to manifest in the life of the native. In horary practice, I follow the movements of the planets in the ephemeris, starting with the planetary positions at the birth of the question. When aspects become exact in the ephemeris, events related to the inquiry occur according to the nature of the aspects.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Table 3 presents the ranges of the traditional orbs of the planets. Lilly reported two sets of orbs for the planets. In choosing which orb or moiety (half the orb) to use, Lilly wrote: "I sometimes use the one, and sometimes the other, as my memory best remembereth them, and this without error" (CA, p. 107). Table 4 shows the typical combined moieties of planetary pairs in aspect in traditional horary.</p>
<p class="cl-center"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0011.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-center"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0012.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-caption">Note: In Table 4, the numbers in parentheses refer to the range of orbs given to the planets, the numbers in the table refer to the sum of the moieties of the two planets involved in the aspect. For example, Venus and Saturn are "within orb" when they are at most eight (or nine) degrees apart, depending on which set of orbs you use for the planets.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0115" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Unlike modern astrologers, who attribute orbs to aspects, Lilly assigned each planet an orb of influence. The planetary orb is an imaginary sphere of light surrounding the planet with the planet at the center of that sphere. The rays of the planet within this sphere (orb) are powerful enough to influence other heavenly bodies by contacting their spheres of light (rays) through conjunction or Ptolemaic aspect; the rays of the two planets are blended according to the nature of the aspect.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In classical astrology, half the orb (the radius of the sphere) is called the moiety, meaning "half-measure." Thus, Jupiter has an orb of 12 degrees and a moiety of 6 degrees. Jupiter's moiety tells us that the light surrounding Jupiter (orb) is potent enough to form aspects when it contacts the light of another planet within a distance (radius) of 6 degrees from Jupiter's body (longitude position along the zodiac).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">To visualize this, picture Jupiter as a point (or more accurately a dot with a diameter of six minutes of arc) at the center of a twelve-degree wide sphere of "Jupiterian light." Jupiter's orb is 12° and his moiety 6°. Similarly, Saturn lies at the center of a 10° wide ball of "Saturnian light" with a moiety (radius) of 5°. Jupiter and Saturn come into contact (conjunct) just as their distance apart decreases to 11° (the sum of their two moieties). At that distance the conjunction begins to take affect. See Figures 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Strictly speaking, the planets are not points but bodies in their own right. Lilly allowed about six minutes of arc for the diameter of a planet's body on the Celestial Sphere, so that even after an aspect became exact the departing bodies of the planets would overlap a little during separation. Because the bodies of the Sun and the Moon occupy just over half a degree of arc in the sky, Lilly allowed about seventeen minutes of arc past exactitude for separation from the Sun or the Moon. For example, Lilly states that the Moon at 17° 40' Cancer is "in perfect trine" with the Sun at 17° 24' Pisces (CA, p. 391). Here the Moon is sixteen minutes past the exact trine of the Sun, but their bodies are still in contact. The following schematics illustrate these ideas about the bodies of planets in perfect aspect:</p>
<p class="cl-fixedcenterreclustered1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0013.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Here, P 1 is the center of the first planet and P2 is the center of the second planet. Each planet has a diameter of 6 minutes and a radius of 3 minutes of arc. The planets are in perfect aspect until their centers are more than 6 minutes of arc apart. The planets separate from perfect aspect when the center of the faster planet gets more than 6 minutes away from the center of the slower planet.</p>
<p class="cl-fixedcenterreclustered"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0014.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Here, the bodies of the Sun and Moon overlap until they are almost thirty-four minutes apart. The Sun and Moon remain in perfect aspect until their centers are more than thirtyfour minutes apart.</p>
<p class="cl-fixedcenterreclustered"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0015.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Here, the bodies of the planet (P) and the Sun (or Moon) overlap and the aspect remains perfect until they are almost twenty minutes apart.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0116" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">To repeat, Lilly considered an aspect between planets to be separating when the center of the faster planet moved more than six minutes of arc away from the center of the other planet. In other words, the planets are separating from aspect when the bodies of the two planets no longer overlap at the angle specified by the aspect. The sum of the radii of two planets is six minutes of arc. The Sun and the Moon have larger diameters than the planets on the celestial sphere. Lilly used about thirty-four minutes of arc for the diameter of the lights, and this figure accords with modern calculations.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">For example, the Sun has a diameter of 865,400 miles and on average a distance of 93,000,000 miles from the earth. If we place the Sun on a circle with the earth as its center, the radius of that circle is 93 million miles, and its circumference is 2 n times the radius. The percent of the sky that the Sun occupies is the diameter of the Sun divided by the circumference of its "orbit" around the earth, namely, 865,400 divided by 2 it times 93 million = 0.00148 of a 360 degree circle = 0.533 degrees = 32 minutes of arc. The Arabs had observed the diameter of the sun to be almost thirty-four minutes of arc and defined a planet as Cazimi (in the heart of the Sun) when the center of the planet was no more than seventeen minutes (the Sun's radius or half its diameter) away from the center of the Sun. Within seventeen minutes of arc the center of the planet remains in contact with the body of the Sun.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">A similar calculation for the Moon, which has a diameter of 2,160 miles and an average distance from the earth of 240,000 miles, shows that the Moon on average occupies thirtyone minutes of arc (that is 360 degrees times 2,160 divided by 2 Ic times 240,000).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The temporal sequence of aspects as they occur in the ephemeris parallels the temporal unfolding of the outcome of the question. According to modern authors, the only restriction is that, when applying to a major aspect with another planet, a significator may not leave the sign that it originally occupies in the chart. Lilly allowed planets to perfect aspects in the next sign provided they were in orb in the previous sign. Aspects that are in orb but will perfect only after the planet changes sign often indicate a significant change in the querent's circumstances.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="147-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Some modern horary astrologers (McEvers, for example) disregard orbs and allow all significators and the Moon to perfect all the aspects they can before leaving their signs. In this sense, the signs of the zodiac are large orbs of influence. The signs of the zodiac are natural boundaries because each sign represents a different area of experience. When a planet moves into a new sign, it enters a new situation and becomes less related to the original circumstances surrounding the question. This idea of signs as discreet areas of experience also gave rise to the notion of critical degrees marking the cusps between signs or between other divisions of the zodiac.</p>

</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0119" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Generally, the first Ptolemaic aspect between primary significators acts as the major indicator of the outcome of the question. Other aspects may clarify or modify the answer given by the first aspect between significators. Translation or collection of light can intervene to bring about a favorable outcome when the first major aspect is a square or an opposition. If a potential aspect becomes perfect only after one or both significators have entered the next sign, that aspect may refer to an event removed from the original situation prompting the question.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">For example, I once received a call from a woman in Seattle, Washington, who asked whether she would marry. It was the weekend after Valentine's Day, 1992, and she must have had love on her mind. See Chart 17. The horary chart has Libra rising, as fits a chart about marriage. The Ascendant ruler Venus (the querent) is at the end of Capricorn and will conjoin Mars (ruler of the prospective husband-Aries 7th cusp) only after both Venus and Mars enter the next sign. Because of the closely applying conjunction between the 1st and 7th rulers, I said she would marry-but only after a change of circumstances (because Venus must change signs to perfect the conjunction with Mars). A couple of years later I received a letter updating me on her circumstances. She had not done well professionally in Seattle (notice Moon ruling the 10th of career and posited in the 10th opposing the restrictive planet Saturn). For career reasons she had moved to Denver, Colorado, where her career went smoothly and she was also able to marry, as the chart had indicated, after a change of circumstances. In this chart, the Uranus/Neptune conjunction posited on the 4th cusp is also suggestive of a major change in the domestic environment.</p>

<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">A CLASSICAL EXAMPLE HIGHLIGHTING ASPECT PRINCIPLES</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On October 29, 1645, around 6:53 P.M., in London, a woman asked Lilly "when her husband, who is imprisoned, will be delivered?" (See Chart 18, p. 78.) Lilly's analysis was brief and to the point: "This question belongs to the 12th house [of prisoners]; Jupiter Lord of the 7th signifies the Lady's husband, in Cancer Retrograde, lately, or the day before, in Trine with the Sun, the Moon applying to a Sextile of Saturn, Retrograde, then to a trine of Jupiter, with a most forcible Reception; from hence I made not many words, but told the Lady, she should neither care to make Friends to his Majesty or any else for delivery of her Husband, for I was assured he either was or would within three days be discharged of his imprisonment, by means of a Solar man, Commander, who would release him and furnish him with what was convenient for his necessity." The woman's husband had been released the day before she asked the question "by an honest Parliament-Colonel, who plentifully relieved him with Money."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="14L-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">The Moon at 29° 10' Aquarius is void of course in the modern sense. A contemporary astrologer might interpret that nothing would come of the matter because the void of course Moon means question is moot-her husband had already been released from prison. Lilly, however, does not consider this Moon void of course because she is within orb of a sextile with Saturn and a trine with Jupiter. Lilly's practice is consistent with Bonatus' definition that the Moon is void of course "when not joined to [within orb of] any planet by body or aspect." Because the Moon is applying within orb to major aspects, Lilly allows her to leave Aquarius and enter Pisces to perfect the sextile with Saturn and then the trine with Jupiter.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0121" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon lies in Aquarius in the sign of Saturn (traditional ruler of Aquarius). Saturn lies in Taurus in the exaltation of the Moon. The Moon and Saturn are in mutual reception. When the Moon passes into Pisces, it enters the Saturn face (decan) of Pisces. The mutual reception, now by sign and face, persists and reinforces the meaning of the sextile between the Moon and Saturn.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Of note in this example is the principle of Bonatus that the planet the Moon will next aspect co-rules the person inquired after. Here the next aspect is the sextile to a retrograde Saturn, which will occur in 1° 26: Thus, according to Bonatus, Saturn becomes a co-ruler of the husband, and his retrograde status means the husband will return. Lilly generally ignored this rule of Bonatus because he felt it did not work in his charts.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In this example Bonatus appears right on target. If Lilly had followed the rule of Bonatus and paid more attention to the Moon/Saturn sextile, he could have told the woman that Moon at the very end of Aquarius (void in the modern sense) and the backward moving Saturn, mutually applying to a sextile in 1° 26, meant that her husband had already gained his freedom within the past day and a half (measuring time backward because of the retrograde Saturn and Moon void in the modern sense).</p>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00034.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 18: "When her husband, who is imprisoned, shall be delivered?" October 29, 1645, 6:53 P.M. GMT, 00W10, 51 N30 Regiomontanus Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0122" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Substituting a degree for a day, the 1° 26' needed to perfect the sextile between the Moon and Saturn corresponds to about thirty-four hours in the past. I say "in the past" because Saturn is retrograde (moving backward) and the void of course Moon, by modern definition, is in a symbolically backward situation. The Moon is never actually retrograde but it can have retrograde equivalents, like being slow in motion or void of course. Although Lilly only reports the time of the husband's release as occurring the day before the question (asked about 7 P.M.), the chart suggests the husband's release took place about 9 A.M. (thirty-four hours earlier) on the previous day. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify my conjecture about the timing of his release.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">As mentioned, Lilly allows the Moon to trine Jupiter after changing signs because she is already in orb of aspecting Jupiter at her current position. The Moon will enter Pisces, ruled by Jupiter, and Jupiter lies in Cancer, ruled by the Moon-a "most forcible reception." Jupiter rules the 7th house of the husband, and Jupiter retrograde (moving back ward) means the husband will return. Jupiter is strong in the first house and exalted in Cancer, these dignities showing the husband's good condition. Jupiter's presence in the first house (of the querent) confirms his return to his wife.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Interestingly, Bonatus gave us a rule about when to use a conjunction that a planet perfects shortly after leaving its sign, suggesting that Bonatus did not judge aspects that perfected after a sign change except in certain circumstances. According to Bonatus, "When one planet applies to the Conjunction of another, if he be near the end of the same sign wherein he is himself, or that other to whom he applies; so that he will pass out of that sign before the Conjunction is perfected; and... if he be joined with him in the following sign to which he is changed,... then the cause is perfected if that planet confers anything on him in that sign wherein he is so joined to him; that is, if any reception happen, unless the said planet, or he to whom he applies, be first joined to another; for then the business comes to nothing, and will not be perfected." Bonatus is right on target in this example.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In summary, the horary chart contains potential aspects which will perfect in the course of time. The order in which those aspects become exact, ephemeris time, before the planets leave their signs is the order in which events will unfold for the question. The transits show the course of events. Lilly also allowed aspects to perfect after the planets change signs, provided they are within orb of perfection prior to the sign change.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">TRADITIONAL VERSUS MODERN RULERSHIPS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Horary astrology developed before the discovery of the three outer planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Traditionally horary astrologers used only the seven classical planets that could be seen with the naked eye. Modern astrologers have tried to incorporate the more recently discovered planets into horary art, with mixed results. According to Sue Ward, the modern planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) are without orbs because they cannot be seen and are not surrounded by "rays" or globes of light that constitute orbs of influence.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Although it may go against the grain of those versed in natal astrology, I use the seven traditional planets as rulers. I tried using the modern rulerships but came across charts where the traditional rulerships gave a more definitive answer. Such experiences caused me to re-institute using the seven classical planets. I do not ignore the newer planets. I simply give them secondary status unless the chart compels me to consider them primary. By way of review, in traditional astrology the Sun rules Leo, the Moon rules Cancer, Mercury rules Gemini and Virgo, Venus rules Taurus and Libra, Mars rules Aries and Scorpio, Jupiter rules Sagittarius and Pisces, and Saturn rules Capricorn and Aquarius.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0123" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">What about the three outer planets? They are useful as co-rulers and as primary significators of forces beyond personal control. The closer a planet is to the sun, the more it affects the individual. The Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars are the most personal of the planets. Jupiter and Saturn extend into the social realm. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have transpersonal significance beyond the control of any individual. They symbolize powerful social, spiritual, or natural forces, and concretely may symbolize the products of modern technology.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Because horary astrology deals with personal questions over which the querent has some control, it makes sense to limit rulerships to the most personal of the planets. The three outer planets can serve as secondary rulers of their respective signs and often show conditions that have an impersonal or universal quality. The outer planets also refer to modern conditions that did not exist in the ancient world.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Uranus is the modern co-ruler of Aquarius, Neptune the modern co-ruler of Pisces, and Pluto the modern co-ruler of Scorpio. If the nature of the question dictates, the astrologer can use common sense to assign the outer planets as primary rulers of particular matters.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">A question such as "Should I undergo psychoanalysis?" falls more naturally to Pluto (psychological probing) than Mars if Scorpio defines the cusp of the quesited. Uranus more accurately symbolizes computer technology than Saturn when Aquarius locates the question. Neptune is a more apt symbol for film making than Jupiter when Pisces governs the quesited. The astrologer's judgment and experience rather than slavish devotion to a rulership book is the key to choosing the appropriate significator.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">THE ASPECTS ARE THE GUTS OF THE CHART</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">To paraphrase Shakespeare: All the horary chart is a stage, and all the planets and lights are merely players. The planets ruling the querent and quesited are the key actors. The house cusps identify what department of life they represent. The signs show in which circumstances the planets find themselves. The aspects are the script that tells the players how to act toward one another. In other words, the aspects are the guts of the horary chart. If the significators make no aspects, generally no action takes place. No guts, no glory. No aspects, no action. When neither the rulers nor the co-rulers make any aspects, you need to tell the querent nothing will take place in the matter.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">By following the sequence of aspects as they occur between the key players in the chart, you can see how events will develop until the final outcome. The nature of each aspect shows the type of action. The first aspect to occur between the two primary significators is the normal basis of judgment. The aspects act as the script that directs the significators on how to relate to one another. The aspects between the planetary rulers determine the outcome of the question. A conjunction brings the querent and quesited together cooperatively. Trines and sextiles show mutual harmony and a helping hand between the two. Oppositions reveal them moving apart because they cannot agree. Squares show the querent and quesited grating at each other, frustrating and blocking each other's activity. Once you understand the script, you can predict the final curtain.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0124" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">APPLYING ASPECTS ONLY</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">The horary chart contains potential aspects between significators. By following these potential aspects to their completion, we can determine the outcome of the question. Applying aspects are those in which the faster planet is approaching the exact angular relationship to a slower planet as specified by the aspect. If the faster applying planet is in direct motion, it is in an earlier degree than the slower planet which it approaches. If the faster planet is retrograde, it can approach the slower planet from a later degree by backward motion. In this latter case, both planets are approaching each other by mutual application.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Applying aspects signify future events. In horary astrology we use applying aspects because horary deals with the future course of a specific act or decision. Separating aspects are those that have already occurred, and the planets are moving away from the angle defined by the aspect. We use separating aspects when we want to know what led up to the question. We saw the usefulness of separating aspects in the chart for Sara's baby. The recently completed square between Mercury (the baby) and Jupiter (ruler of the baby's 6th house of illness) coincided with Sara's awareness that something had gone wrong the previous day, and in fact identified the time of the baby's death.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">PLANETS' SPEED: FASTER PLANETS APPLY TO SLOWER ONES</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">In conventional astrology, the faster planet always applies to a slower one. Mohammed goes to the mountain; the mountain does not come to Mohammed. When describing aspects, we always name the faster planet first. Thus, the Moon applies to Mercury, but Mercury does not apply to the Moon unless Mercury is retrograde and approaches the Moon in apparent backward motion. The approximate average daily speeds of the planets are listed here in order from fastest to slowest.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In Table 5, note that the mean values (not the average daily motions) of the fastest and slowest times used by Lilly are for Mercury 1° 23' and for Venus 1° 12' (See Clark, The Horary Practitioner, 1996 Special Edition, p. 15).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="15J-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Bear in mind that these are only average daily speeds and planets may move faster or slower than at the rates listed. When a planet is stationary, it appears to be standing still; when retrograde, it has an apparent backward motion. In these cases, you can follow the planetary motion in an ephemeris to determine whether the stationary or retrograde planet is approaching an aspect with another planet. In addition, Pluto sometimes travels inside the orbit of Neptune, and Pluto then moves faster than Neptune with reference to the earth. In this century Pluto is within the orbit of Neptune from January of 1979 until March of 1999. As with retrograde planets, it is easiest to follow the aspects of these outermost planets in an ephemeris.</p>

<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">THE FIVE PTOLEMAIC OR MAJOR ASPECTS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Traditionally horary astrology has relied on the five major aspects described by Ptolemy. The Ptolemaic aspects are the conjunction (0°), sextile (60°), square (90°), trine (120°), and opposition (180°). The conjunction, sextile and trine favor a positive outcome. The square and opposition bring obstacles and problems.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The conjunction brings the significators into a close relationship with one another. It fosters cooperation, brings the querent and quesited together, and unites whatever the planets signify.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The sextile gives the querent an opportunity to bring a matter to perfection. The querent will need to grasp the opportunity to make it a reality. Sextiles require more effort than trines. The 3rd and 11th houses are in sextile relationship to the 1st.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The trine represents a fortunate relationship between significators. They will work toward a common good. The accomplishment of a desired task will be easy. Trines imply good luck and success without much effort. The 5th and 9th houses are trine the 1st.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The opposition is a negative, disappointing, separative aspect. When the significators apply to a 180° aspect, they are at odds, pulling apart, or on opposite sides of the fence. If the rulers of two people are in opposition, those individuals are in conflict and moving away from one another. The 7th house is opposite the first. A planet in the sign opposite the one it rules is in its "detriment."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The square is also a negative influence and suggests problems and obstacles to overcome. Squares are high-energy aspects so sometimes the matter will perfect but in a way the querent will regret. Squares show frustrations, difficulties, losses, and the need to exert much effort to accomplish anything. They represent stress and strain between the significators. The 4th and 10th houses are square the 1st.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The meanings of the aspects have remained stable for centuries. Firmicus Maternus in the mid-300s A.D. had the following to say about them. The opposition is "always an unfavorable and threatening sign." The trine is a "prosperous and fortunate aspect." The square is a "threatening sign full of adverse influence." Finally, "sextile aspects are the same as the trine, but less powerful."</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0126" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Lilly used the technique that, in signs of long ascension, sextiles got stretched out and acted like squares, and squares got stretched out and acted like trines. In signs of short ascension squares got shrunk to favorable sextiles and trines shrunk into squares. This horary legerdemain sometimes got him out of jams in his interpretations. More about this in a later chapter.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">QUINCUNXES: OUT OF JOINT</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Quincunx literally means five-twelfths (Latin: quinque-"five," and uncia-"twelfth part"). That's five-twelfths of a circle. One twelfth is 30° and 5 x 30° = 150°. Many astrologers regard the quincunx (150°) as a major aspect in natal astrology. Some horary astrologers give it almost Ptolemaic status and regard it as negative. Ptolemy called signs in quincunx (five signs apart) "inconjunct" or "disjunct;" which colloquially means "out of joint."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The quincunx aspect implies something is out of joint and the querent will need to adjust it. Some facet of the situation will require restructuring, re-negotiation, or alteration. The querent may need to lend support, financial or otherwise, to a person involved in the question. The quincunx relates naturally to the sixth and eighth houses, each being five houses from the first. Quincunxes suggest sixth and eighth house issues such as illness, service, distress, drudgery, surgery, injury, death, taxes, or joint finances. The Moon's quincunxes with the malefics were prominent in the October 1989 San Francisco earthquake chart. While quincunxes do not qualify as traditional major aspects, they can often be informative in a horary chart.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">THE USEFULNESS OF QUINCUNXES IN HORARY: AN EXAMPLE</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On June 23, 1990, at 11:58 A.M. EDT at 73W01, 41N19, my sister-in-law asked, "Will I need to buy a new air conditioner? Can I fix the one I have? What's wrong with it?" See Chart 19.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The chart has 20° Virgo rising, so Mercury at 21° Gemini in the 10th rules the querent. Air conditioners are shown by the 6th house (appliances), which has 21° Aquarius on the cusp. The rulers of the air conditioner are Saturn, retrograde at 23° Capricorn, and Uranus, retrograde at 8° Capricorn.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Because Mercury (the querent) is mutually applying to a quincunx with Saturn (the air conditioner), I told her that the air conditioner could be fixed or adjusted (quincunx). The retrograde status of the air conditioner's rulers showed its debilitated state. Saturn suggested an obstruction of some kind. The trine of Mercury to the 6th cusp supported a favorable outcome.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="167-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">The repairman discovered that some debris from her roof (which had been repaired over the winter) had fallen into the air conditioner, obstructing its fan (Uranus). She suffered two days of discomfort as a result (Mercury was two degrees from the quincunx to Saturn). The quincunx exactly described her relationship to her air conditioner.</p>

</div>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">PARALLELS AND CONTRAPARALLELS OF DECLINATION</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Two planets are "parallel of declination" when they are at the same declination, that is, the same angular distance above or below (north or south of) the Celestial Equator. When two planets are equidistant above or below the equator but one is north and the other south, they are "contraparallel:"</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Declination measures planetary position north or south of the equator. In contrast, the measure of distance above or below the Ecliptic is "celestial latitude" and should not be confused with declination. Celestial latitude refers to the ecliptic; declination refers to the equator. The ecliptic and the equator are at a 23.5° angle from one another, the so-called obliquity of the ecliptic.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Parallels have become popular in modern times. In the Newcastle edition of Lilly's text, Zadkiel added the line that the parallel "is the most powerful of all aspects but is not generally used in horary astrology." Many would disagree that the parallel is so powerful, and only the school of ivy Jacobson seems to use parallels in horary work.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Instead of using parallels, William Lilly paid attention to antiscions and contra-antiscions (or contrascions). Antiscions are the two points on the Ecliptic that are at the same distance east or west of the Summer or Winter Solstice, points where the sun has the same declination. By definition, the Sun is parallel to its antiscion degree. Contrascions are the two points on the Ecliptic, the same distance east or west of the Spring or Autumn Equinoxes, where the sun has equal but opposite declination north or south of the Celestial Equator. By definition, the Sun is contraparallel to its contrascion degree. According to Lilly, a conjunction of a benefic planet to an antiscion is "equal to a sextile or a trine." Lilly also felt that a conjunction to a contrascion is "of the nature of a square or opposition."</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0128" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In his seminal first-century work on "interrogations," Dorotheus does not refer to parallels of declination, but he does mention aspects in latitude (north and south of the Ecliptic rather than the Celestial Equator). Unlike modern astrologers who act as if the world is flat, Dorotheus pictured the horoscope in three dimensions. For Dorotheus planets could conjoin along the zodiac circle or in celestial latitude above or below the ecliptic.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">For example, in his chapter on fugitive slaves, Dorotheus writes, "If the Moon conjoins with Mars in longitude, then beating and imprisonment will reach the runaway at that hour in this running away of his. If the Moon is conjoining with Jupiter in latitude while Jupiter aspects Mars, then it indicates that misfortune will reach the runaway because of the Moon's conjoining with Mars and fear of death will be immoderate in him, but he will escape from this death because of Jupiter's aspect of the Moon." Here the Moon and Mars conjoin on the ecliptic, which indicates a beating (Mars) for the fugitive (Moon); but because the Moon (the slave) lies at the same Celestial Latitude as Jupiter (good luck), the slave escapes death.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">My impression is that those who use parallels of declination are the followers of Ivy Jacobson. She regards the parallel and contraparallel of declination as similar to the conjunction and uses a one-degree orb. According to Jacobson, if a parallel exists between significators, "the thing is as good as done now." She feels that a parallel can "save" the Moon from being void of course (making no Ptolemaic aspect before leaving sign). Jacobson says that if the Moon is void of course "but is parallel Fortuna, she still will bring the matter to perfection." In Jacobson's way of thinking, the Moon is "only zodiacally void of course" when parallel to Pars Fortuna. To find the declination of the Part of Fortune, one looks up the declination of the sun when it occupies the same degree of the zodiac as the Part of Fortune.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Unlike Jacobson, I restrict the definition of the void of course Moon to the five major Ptolemaic aspects; otherwise, for me, the Moon is in an aspect vacuum. I can find no classical references that support her use of parallels of declination to "save" the Moon from being void of course. To be honest, I have not tested her theory. Readers will have to try Jacobson's ideas and see for themselves.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">MUTUAL RECEPTIONS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Mutual receptions are potent forces in horary astrology. Bonatus says "reception abates all malice." I receive you when I invite you into my home. Planet A receives planet B when B enters one of the essential dignities of A, that is, when B is in As home sign, exaltation, triplicity, term, or face. Don't worry about these concepts now; I will explain essential dignity in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Two planets are in "mutual reception" by sign when each planet is in the sign ruled by the other. I am staying at your house and you are staying at mine. Remember that astrology was originally an anthropomorphic theory. Each planet owns certain regions of the zodiac. If I want something from Jupiter, I cannot get it from a territory owned by Mars. I must go to one of Jupiter's dignities because that's where he keeps his goods.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0129" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">There can also be mutual reception by any combination of essential dignities. Mutual reception by ruling sign is the strongest. Some astrologers believe that mutual receptions give the planets exchange status. In other words, you can read the planet back in its own sign, exaltation, triplicity, term, or face, as the case may be. Ivy Jacobson says that when you read planets back in their own dignity they stay in the same degree they originally occupied in the chart. Others, such as Olivia Barclay, allow the planets to exchange degrees when they exchange signs.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">ALL THE MOON'S ASPECTS AND MUTUAL RECEPTIONS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">As the fastest moving body, the Moon represents the general climate and routine changes surrounding the question. The aspects the Moon has made in the same sign before the time of the question signify events that led up to the question. The planet the Moon most recently passed over, no matter how far back in the chart, colors the character of the Moon and influences its role in the question. All the aspects the Moon will make before changing sign show the future developments of the matter. The final aspect the Moon will make before changing sign shows the general conditions of the outcome of the matter. The specific outcome is shown by the significators. The astrologer should consider all the aspects and mutual receptions the Moon makes before it changes sign.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Some astrologers overemphasize the significance of the Moon in horary. I agree with Jones that the role of the horary Moon is secondary and adjunctive. Jones describes the Moon as "the special distributor of the more trivial indication in any given reference; i.e., the public panorama, experience in general." He adds that the Moon "shows the particular emphasis of that which, while pertinent, is essentially trivial. This includes normal necessary activities, the passing touch with other people collectively, and the ebb and flow of emotional, reflex and physiological reactions to the general rhythm of the world." The nature of the last aspect of the Moon correlates with the answer to the specific horary question about 50% of the time-a frequency accounted for by chance alone! The system I follow for horary analysis puts the Moon in the back seat. What drives the chart are the aspects between the rulers of the significant houses.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">WHEN TO CONSIDER MINOR ASPECTS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Although there are dozens of minor aspects, the three most commonly used in horary are the semi-sextile (30°), semi-square (45°), and sesquiquadrate (135°). Keep in mind that major aspects indicate major events, and minor aspects show minor ones.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="16V-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">The semi-square and sesquiquadrate resemble the square in their effect. The semi-sextile relates signs that adjoin one another; that is, signs with a 2nd or 12th house relationship. Because the 2nd house governs the querent's substance and money, the semi-sextile is helpful in financial matters. On the other hand, because the 12th house rules the querent's confinement, sorrow, hospitalization, grief, and undoing, the semi-sextile without reception is unfortunate in health-related questions, especially if the faster planet is approaching the slower one from a 12th house direction.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0130" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The horary astrologer can use minor aspects when the major or semi-major (quincunx, reception, parallel for those so inclined) aspects provide insufficient information. They are helpful as confirmations of other indications in the chart. I have found minor aspects reliable under the following conditions. Obviously the more of these conditions that apply, the stronger the influence of the minor aspect.</p>
<p class="cl-list">• The minor aspect is nearly exact within one degree of orb.</p>
<p class="cl-list">• The planets making the minor aspect are dignified or exalted by house or sign.</p>
<p class="cl-list">• The planets making the minor aspect are in mutual reception.</p>
<p class="cl-list">• One or both significators making the minor aspect are closely conjunct a benefic fixed star such as Spica (23° 50' Libra in 2000) or the Part of Fortune.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">THE USEFULNESS OF MINOR ASPECTS IN HORARY: AN EXAMPLE</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On the morning of Friday the 13th in July of 1990, my friend and colleague, Luis, told me that he was worried that his car loan might not be approved. I noted the time and location to be 9:43 A.M. EDT, 72W50/41N27, when I asked the horary question, "Will Luis get the loan?" See Chart 20.</p>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00036.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 20: "Will Luis get the loan?" July 13, 1990, 9:43 A.M. EDT, 72W50, 41 N27 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0131" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Virgo is rising, and so I am represented by Mercury, which is in the 11th house of friends, and my question concerns a friend. The chart appears radical. With Pisces on the 7th cusp of the named other person (using McEvers' method of horary), Jupiter and Neptune rule Luis, as does the Moon, which inhabits the 7th house. The loan is signified by the 8th from the 7th, or the 2nd house of the radix. Libra is on the 2nd cusp, so Venus rules the loan. Venus also rules Friday, the day of the question.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Venus (loan) applies to an almost exact semi-sextile (a financial aspect) with Jupiter (Luis). The loan is fast approaching Luis. The Moon, though void of course, is in Pisces, where it can still function. The Moon is also in mutual reception with Jupiter, and this supports a favorable outcome.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">After reading the chart, I encouraged Luis to call the credit union. He telephoned shortly after 10 A.M. EDT and was told at 10:07 A.M. that the loan had been approved. The semisextile between Venus and Jupiter became exact (according to the ephemeris) at 10:09 A.M. EDT, two minutes after he learned of the loan's approval!</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">MUTUAL APPLICATION</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">When one planet is direct and the other retrograde, they can apply to each other to make an aspect. Because each planet is moving toward the other, we call this condition "mutual application" and regard it as a potent force in bringing an event to pass. An aspect carries more weight if it occurs by mutual application.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Chart 21 is an example of two mutual applications in a single chart. On September 14, 1996, British astrologer Sue Ward posted a note on the Internet that the manager of a local "off license" (place to buy alcohol) was missing his timid fluffy red cat. Sue found the following note in her door and cast a chart for the time (6:42 Pm. BST) when she understood the question: "Have you found our cat? Large ginger tabby/spotty male called Ed [Red Ed - get it?]. Wearing a yellow collar ... Reward is offered."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I wrote to Sue that I thought the cat would return in a day or two. The querent has several rulers: Jupiter (Pisces rising), Saturn retrograde in the 1st, and Venus-Almuten of Ascendant. Saturn retrograde in the 1st raises some concern about the outcome. The cat is shown by the 6th house with a Cancer cusp so the cat ruler is the Moon primarily (Moon also naturally rules strays), but also Venus and Mars which occupy the 6th. Moon is Almuten of 6th. The Sun also rules the cat because Leo is intercepted in the 6th.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon is void of course by Lilly's definition so I suspected that the cat had wandered off and was wandering aimlessly in a westerly direction (Libra, 7th house). With Moon in the 7th in Libra (disposed by Venus, Almuten of 1st), I thought there was a good chance the cat would return. The 7th house emphasis suggested that the spouse or partner of the owner has or would find the cat. Because the cat was red, I thought Mars might describe the cat. If Mars in 6th is the cat, Mars is mutually applying to a trine of Saturn in 1st (the manager and owner of the cat), so the cat may return rather quickly.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The cat was spotted by a neighbor east of its home (not west as the chart suggested) and returned home five days later on the morning of September 19 with some injuries to its legs and tail (as suggested by Saturn retrograde in the 1st house). Note that the Sun (the cat) and Mercury (ruler of the 3rd of neighbors and the 7th of the manager's spouse) are mutually applying to a conjunction in five degrees (symbolizing five days).</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0132" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">DEXTER (WAXING) AND SINISTER (WANING) ASPECTS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Dexter means "on the right-hand side of" and sinister means "on the left-hand side of." When astrologers actually looked at the night sky, they observed that when two planets traveling direct were separating from a conjunction, the faster planet would "cast its rays" to the right of itself, thereby forming a dexter aspect. In this case the faster planet was waxing with respect to the slower one. Because waxing or "increasing in light" were considered beneficial, dexter aspects were regarded as stronger than sinister ones.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">A sinister aspect occurs when the faster planet casts its rays to the left of itself to form the aspect. If the faster planet is direct in motion, it is approaching an eventual conjunction with the slower one and is thus waning or decreasing in light. The ancients regarded waning or sinister aspects as less potent than waxing or dexter ones.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="17O-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Confusion arose because many contemporary "authorities" did not understand what the ancient texts meant by dexter and sinister, that is, what was on the left or right side of what. Several modern texts actually reverse the traditional meanings of dexter and sinister. In addition, what is dexter (on the right) in the northern hemisphere is sinister (on the left) Lilly used aspects to the cusp of the house ruling a person to derive information. For example, the chart on page 452 of Lilly's Christian Astrology (Dec 8, 1642; Tz = 0; 9.20 A.M.; 51N30, OW10) deals with the status of Prince Rupert, signified by the 10th house or 10° Scorpio on the MC. The Moon is at 10° Cancer, and Jupiter is at 10° Pisces. Lilly writes: "I must confess, at first finding the Moon in Cancer to cast her Trine Sinister to the cusp of the 10th, I judged the person of the man would be in no great danger ... and verily Jupiter doth also cast his Trine Dexter to the cusp of the 10th house, whereby I judged that we should not destroy his person." Sometimes a significator's aspect to a house cusp, especially a conjunction, will show the timing of an event.</p>

<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead1">ASPECTS TO HOUSE CUSPS</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">TRANSLATION OF LIGHT: AN ASTROLOGICAL BUCKET BRIGADE</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Translation of light can either restore the action of a separating aspect between significators, or can intercede before a difficult aspect between significators becomes exact. Suppose, for example, that the primary significators have recently formed a major aspect that would have brought the matter to perfection if only the planets were still applying. Translation of light can come to the rescue.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Translation means that a planet that is faster than both significators can carry the light from one primary significator to another, reactivating a recent past aspect or interposing a favorable connection before a square or opposition can take place. It's like an astrological bucket brigade or the passing of a baton in a relay race. In the first instance, the significators were in aspect, they have passed that aspect, and a planet faster than both brings them into connection again. In the second instance, the significators are applying to an unfavorable square or opposition, but the faster third planet favorably connects their lights before the difficult aspect becomes exact. Study Figure 4 for an example from Bonatus of translation of light. Let me give an anthropomorphic example to illustrate these ideas of translation of light. Suppose you need both your uncle and your grandfather to sign a document. You go to grandpa's house and discover that your uncle has recently visited your grandfather but has already left. You obtain your grandfather's signature and leave in search of your uncle. If you're fast enough, you can catch up with your uncle and get him to sign also. Because you move faster than both your elders, you can transport the document from one to the other and bring them into contact again.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0136" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">A variation on this theme would be that, left to their own devices, your uncle and grandfather would never sign the document. Instead, they would be in opposition and might even square off against one another. Being younger and faster, you approach both your uncle and grandfather separately and use your charm (sextiles and trines) to get each of them to sign the document individually, thus bringing the matter to perfection.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="186-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">A footnote to the aphorisms of Bonatus says that translation of light occurs "when a planet separates from one that is slower than itself, and overtakes another either by conjunction or aspect." The classical definition requires that the significator from which the faster planet separates must receive the translating planet in one of its essential dignities. In other words, the faster planet must start out in a segment of the zodiac governed (through one of the dignities) by the first significator so that it can carry the light of the first significator with it to the second one. As in a relay race, the translating planet must accept the baton from a member of its own team, not from an unrelated team.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0138" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00039.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Figure 4</p>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Example of translation from Bonatus: Venus and Mars are the primary significators. Mars is at 200 Scorpio, Venus at 12° Taurus, and Mercury at 17° Pisces. The faster third planet Mercury separates from sextile to Venus, who receives Mercury in her exaltation Pisces. Mercury carries the light of Venus to Mars, which Mercury is about to trine, creating a favorable connection between the primary significators. By transferring the light of Venus to Mars, Mercury allows a favorable outcome, which would otherwise be denied because Venus opposes Mars.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0139" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Many modern astrologers do not require reception by essential dignity and allow the faster planet to aspect both significators in turn, rather than separating from one and applying to the other. The modern definition is this: a third planet faster than both significators and in an earlier degree, must aspect each of them in turn to translate the light and restore the potency of the separating aspect that exists between significators.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">To translate the light of an aspect, the translating planet must be moving faster than both significators. Naturally this role often falls to the Moon or Mercury, the two fastest bodies in the tropical zodiac. These two bodies take on the coloring of any planets they aspect. We saw in the San Francisco earthquake chart how Mercury, having completed squares to Uranus and Saturn, and applying to squares with Jupiter and Neptune, translated the light and reactivated the various conjunctions and oppositions among these heavy planets. The Moon played a similar role in the earthquake chart as it translated the light among the various heavy planets, recharging their previous malefic connections.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Translation of light is easy to miss if you don't look for it. The trick is this: if the two primary significators are applying to a square or an opposition, or have recently made a favorable aspect that you wish you could use to answer the question, see whether a faster planet can create a favorable connection by translating the light from one significator to the other. A third planet translation the light implies that a third party will voluntarily enter the situation to help in its completion.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">COLLECTION OF LIGHT: THE ASTROLOGICAL STOREHOUSE</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">In translation of light, a faster (lighter) third planet can reactivate an aspect that recently occurred between significators but is now over, or can interpose a positive connection between significators before a stressful aspect between them becomes exact.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In collection of light, a slower (heavier) third planet can establish a contact between significators that are not applying to a favorable major aspect needed to perfect the matter. It may be that the significators will not form a major aspect or else will oppose (or square) one another, denying perfection of the matter. Perfection is still possible, however, if a slower third planet stores up the energies of the two faster significators in a weightier spot in the zodiac.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Suppose the two primary significators make no favorable Ptolemaic aspect before leaving their signs, but it would be nice for the outcome if they did. Suppose further that each significator applies to a major aspect with a third planet slower than both and in a later degree. The slower third planet can act like a toll collector, or, better yet, a lightning rod that draws and stores the energy from both significators to make it available to perfect the matter.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="18J-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">In the classical definition of collection of light, each significator must receive the slower third planet in at least one of its essential dignities. In other words, the heavier third planet must be in the sign, exaltation, triplicity, term, or face of the primary significators. Symbolically the heavier third planet represents a third party to whom both persons can turn for help in bringing the matter to perfection.</p>

<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Bonatus gives the example of a night chart with the Sun and Jupiter as primary significators. Jupiter lies at 15° Sagittarius, the Sun at 14° Gemini, and weighty Saturn at 18° Aries. Saturn lies in Aries, the exaltation of the Sun, so the Sun receives Saturn through its exaltation. Jupiter receives Saturn through his triplicity because Jupiter rules the fire triplicity (Aries) by night. Jupiter applies to a trine of Saturn, and the Sun applies to a sextile of Saturn. The problem is that the Sun and Jupiter are applying to an opposition-a separative aspect that will not allow perfection of the matter. Saturn, however, being in a later degree than both the Sun and Jupiter, is able to collect both their lights just after the Sun and Jupiter form an opposition, thus bringing the matter to perfection. Symbolically, Saturn signifies a third person who facilitates a fortunate completion.</p>

<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered" id="18O-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Example of Collection of Light from Bonatus: The Sun and Jupiter are the primary significators. Jupiter is at 15° Sagittarius, the Sun at 14° Gemini, and Saturn at 18° Aries. The heaviest planet Saturn lies in Aries, the exaltation of the Sun, so the Sun receives Saturn through its exaltation. Jupiter receives Saturn through his triplicity because Jupiter rules the fire triplicity (Aries) by night. Jupiter applies to Saturn by trine, and the Sun applies to Saturn by sextile. The Sun and Jupiter are applying to an opposition-a separative aspect that implies non-accomplishment. However, just after Sun opposes Jupiter, the heavier third planet Saturn will collect the light of both the Sun and Jupiter and favorably reunite them, allowing the matter to come to perfection. Symbolically, Saturn signifies a third person who can bring the matter to a fortunate completion.</p>

<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Like translation, collection is easy to miss if you don't look for it. You should check for collection when the two significators make no favorable aspect but you wish that they did. If the two primary rulers make no aspect between themselves, or apply to a square or opposition, ask if they will each favorably aspect an even slower planet; if so, that slower third planet can collect their lights and bring the matter to perfection. Study Figure 5 for an example from Bonatus of collection of light.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE OF MORE ADVANCED CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">The following case illustrates many of the concepts in this chapter. Joan McEvers had included this question when she sent me the one about her son's stained glass business. It was a second question whose horary chart puzzled her. See Chart 22.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">McEvers is the querent. On June 24, 1987, at 10 A.M. PST, 116W46/47N41, she asked, "Will I get the job with Llewellyn?" Ordinarily I would interview the querent to find out more about the type of job and the circumstances surrounding the question. Because I was working with only the verbatim question, I had to approach this chart cold. The only thing I knew was that Llewellyn is a publisher of astrological books, including this one. I also had a bias that Llewellyn would be foolish not to hire someone of McEvers' stature.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">There are no classical considerations before judgment. Virgo rising, ruled by Mercury (writers), fits the querent. Mercury ruling both the Ascendant and the MC links the 1st and 10th houses, suggesting the querent (1st) is asking about a job (10th) about writing, books, or communication (Mercury). The sun and Moon in the loth house also imply a question about career. Cancer on the cusp of the 11th and Mercury (questions) in the 11th house highlight income from career. Leo on the cusp of the 12th points to work done in solitude, such as writing and editing. The chart appears radical and fit to judge.</p>

<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 22: "Will I get the job with Llewellyn?" June 24, 1987, 10:00 A.M. PST, 116W46, 47N41 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0144" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In the context of the question, the chart tells me that the "job with Llewellyn" most likely involves writing or editing (Mercury) for the publisher in the solitude of her home (12th). With Virgo rising, Mercury-McEvers' ruler-is retrograde at 16° 20' Cancer in the 11th house. The retrograde significator suggests she might change her mind about the job, or it might involve going back over something as in editing a book (Mercury).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The 6th house rules routine tedious work and the 10th governs career and profession. Since the chart emphasizes the 10th house, I took Gemini on the cusp of the 10th to rule the job. I couldn't imagine McEvers doing 6th house drudge work for Llewellyn. They get people like my editor to do that. Mercury, ruler of Gemini, already rules McEvers so we need to use the planets in the 10th to symbolize the job. There are three planets in the 10th: the Moon, Venus, and the sun-all considered benefics by Bonatus, suggesting a positive answer to the question.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">There are no major Ptolemaic aspects between McEvers' ruler Mercury and the three planets representing the job. I think this is why McEvers found the chart puzzling. But, mirabile dictu, the Moon and Mercury are in mutual reception and are also mutually applying to an exact semi-sextile in only three minutes of arc. The semi-sextile is favorable for financial matters. The combined mutual application and mutual reception (Moon in Gemini ruled by Mercury, Mercury in Cancer ruled by the Moon) are compelling indications that she will get the job.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Furthermore, consider the following. The fastest body, the Moon at 16° 17' Gemini, will semi-sextile Mercury retrograde at 16° 20' Cancer and then conjoin Venus at 16° 28' Gemini, thus translating the light of Mercury (McEvers) to Venus (the job). This confirms she will get the job.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">We see yet another confirmation in the application of the Moon (which always co-rules the querent) to a conjunction with Venus (the job). Venus in this chart also rules the 9th house of publishers (Llewellyn) and the 2nd house (6th of the 9th) of the publisher's employees. The Moon (McEvers) conjoins (comes together with) Venus (the publisher and his employees)-yet another sign that Llewellyn will hire her.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The outcome was that McEvers got the job, which involved editing a book for Llewellyn in the solitude of her home office. The retrograde Mercury (documents) correlated with a re-negotiation of the contract.</p>

<p class="cl-2centerhead">HISTORICAL INTERLUDE WILLIAM LILLY AND THE FIRE OF LONDON</p>
<p class="cl-3nonindpara">William Lilly was a British astrologer whose Christian Astrology is the classic western textbook on horary astrology. His fame increased when he predicted the great fire of London (September 2, 1666). He disseminated his predictions via a now-famous woodcut depicting the Gemini twins descending into a conflagration, which is shown below. The chart for the driving of the first pile of the new London Bridge has Gemini rising, and in the astrological community Gemini was associated with the city of London.</p>
<p class="cl-4indedpara">This fire had also been predicted by Nostradamus a century earlier when he wrote, "The blood of the just, which has been spilled in London, requires it be burn with fire in sixty-six." Lilly's prediction of the fire was so well-known that the House of Commons summoned him to appear before an investigating committee to explain what he knew about the conflagration.</p>
