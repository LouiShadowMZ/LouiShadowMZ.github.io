 his book grew out of the confusion I experienced while reading the existing horary literature. As I took notes to clarify horary concepts, I discovered numerous contradictions among the authors who wrote about the art. The authorities couldn't seem to agree about the meanings of many of the terms commonly used in horary practice.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">To get to the bottom of some of the definitions, I found myself reading backwards in time from twentieth-century horary authors to nineteenth-century ones such as Simmonite. I discovered that almost everything written about horary after the seventeenth century was essentially derived from Lilly's 1647 masterpiece Christian Astrology. Lilly was a genius at horary analysis and his work is a monument to his scholarly erudition and empirical verification of the art. But even Lilly fell prey to some nonsense of the ancients, like squares that conveniently become trines and vice versa. I felt a need to understand how Lilly arrived at his system and I continued to trace his sources back in time.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">My search led me to the thirteenth century works of Guido Bonatus, from whom Lilly derived much of his system. Bonatus, in turn, had learned astrology from the works of Manilius and Firmicus Maternus, and horary largely from Latin translations of the ninthcentury Arabic texts by Abu Ma'Shar. Although the Arabs contributed much detail to astrology, they learned the basics from Arabic translations of the Greek texts by Ptolemy, Dorotheus of Sidon, and Antioch of Athens. The Greeks, of course, had distilled the astrological wisdom of the Babylonians and Egyptians, particularly at the great center of learning in Alexandria. The fertile crescent of the Middle East is where it all began. Astrologers will not be surprised by the symbolic connection between the fertile crescent and the phases of the Moon, the most important planet in horary.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Writing this book and studying numerous horary charts helped to clarify my thinking about the art. After trying many rules and different systems, I found myself returning to the fundamentals espoused by Dorotheus, Bonatus, and Lilly. I would like to summarize my thinking about the practice of horary astrology. A horoscope cast for the moment a baby enters the world from the womb symbolically captures some essential meanings about the nature and life of that individual. Similarly, a chart erected for the moment of birth of a pressing personal question symbolically represents the nature and ramifications of the querent's concern. Fortunately, a horary chart will warn the astrologer when the question is less than sincere or when the astrologer may have difficulty interpreting the chart or satisfying the client.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0314" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The classical method of horary analysis is simple to state but often complex to put into action. The person asking the question belongs in the first house. The matter inquired about belongs in one of the twelve mundane houses. When the question is about someone else, the astrologer uses the derivative system of houses.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Each house has a planetary ruler. The planet ruling the person asking the question and the planet ruling the matter asked about will make a major Ptolemaic aspect, or they will not. The next applying aspect between primary significators shows what will happen between the querent and the quesited. If there is no aspect, nothing will happen. An analysis of this aspect between the two significators is the essential step in horary judgment. A host of rules can modify the message given by that aspect.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In reading a horary chart, it helps to assume an anthropomorphic viewpoint. The planets become people or things that relate to one another. The aspects show how they do it. Planets can be strong or weak depending on their dignities and status in the chart. The astrological symbolism must fit the empirical situation.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The above principles are the essence of the horary method. I have covered many of the details in the earlier chapters of this text. If you are as enthusiastic about horary as I am, the next step is to analyze as many charts as you can. Silly questions will produce trivial charts with contradictory or confusing indications. The more sincere and meaningful the question, the more precisely the astrological symbolism will fit. Such charts give the astrologer an uncanny feeling and a sense of awe at the concordance between the universe and the human mind.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">As you do horary charts, be sure to save them for review after you see how things turn out. All horary astrologers make mistakes. When you get wrong answers, go back to the chart and find where you went wrong. The key to success in horary is to remain firm in the conviction that, if the question is sincere, the answer lies buried in the chart. Your job as a horary practitioner is to release the meaning pent up in the astrological symbolism. Don't be afraid to consult with another astrologer if you get stuck on a particular question, especially when Saturn (the teacher) appears in the 7th house. Some charts may take months or even years to release their secrets to you.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Difficulty understanding a horary figure frequently results from a blind spot in the astrologer's world view. If you stick with a chart that gives you trouble until you comprehend it, you will grow personally, enlarge your understanding of the world, and enhance your skill as an astrologer. My friend Luis Alvarado commented that asking a horary question is like casting a stone into the water and watching how the ripples spread out into the universe.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">An appreciation of horary principles will improve your ability at other branches of astrology. Skill at horary or other forms of astrology is largely a function of the practitioner's ability to think symbolically. Some people seem to do this easily and others only with great difficulty. There are many ways to enhance your appreciation of symbolism. Reading the classics of world literature, including poetry, will acquaint you with the basic themes faced by the human race. Learning a foreign language can help you see how different images are associated with human experience. I found Freud's Interpretation of Dreams coupled with an analysis of my own dreams to be of great assistance in understanding how the mind thinks symbolically. Freud's pupil Carl Jung further explored the universe of archetypal images.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0315" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Almost any form of meditation, including creative visualization, will be of great benefit to the horary astrologer. Pondering the great myths of humanity or meditating on archetypal symbols such as those depicted in the Tarot are powerful techniques for enhancing one's ability to think symbolically.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">If you wish to learn more about the history of astrology, the books by Tester and by McIntosh are excellent sources of information. They are listed in the bibliography. Finally, if you are interested in learning more about horary astrology, you must read the seminal 1647 text by William Lilly. Carol Wiggers of Just Us &amp; Associates (1420 N.W. Gilman Blvd., Suite 2154, Issaquah, WA 98027) has typed the entire text into her computer and made it available in modern type to twentieth century readers. She also publishes an excellent journal devoted to traditional horary astrology called The Horary Practitioner.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Other useful horary texts are those by Simmonite, Jones, Jacobson, DeLong, Appleby, and Barclay. The classics by Ptolemy, Dorotheus, and Bonatus provide a solid foundation in the ancient tradition of the art. Thanks to Project Hindsight, more and more of the classic sources are becoming available in English. As you read horary texts, including this one, never take the authority of the author at face value. Test the horary rules for yourself and use only those that provide consistent and reliable results. The proof of the pudding is always in the eating.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Since the first edition of this text, the world has seen the explosion of information available on the Internet. Readers with a computer will surely want to check out several excellent sites devoted to horary astrology. Carol Wiggers, Sue Ward, and Allen Edwall all have World Wide Web pages devoted to horary and traditional techniques. By the time this edition is published there will doubtless be even more available about astrology on the information superhighway.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Having given my last bit of advice, it is time to bring matters to a close. This book began with a question by my friend Sara. It is fitting that it should also end with one of Sara's questions. On Tuesday, January 16, 1990, at 10:00 P.M. EST Sara telephoned with the question, "Where is John's GameBoy?" Her seven year old son could not find one of his favorite video games and was beside himself with concern. I was feeling tired at the end of a day and was not in the mood to analyze a horary chart; but John was quite upset so I turned on the computer and brought the chart up on the screen. See Chart 59.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I warned Sara that I was sleepy and would only give her a cursory reading. My preference would have been to print out the chart, study it carefully, look up information in references, meditate on the symbolism, and then give a well-reasoned answer. In my haste to give Sara some feedback, I ignored the late Ascendant. Because Sara had asked about John's GameBoy and did not say "my son John," I used the 7th cusp to represent John. With Pisces on the 7th, John's rulers are Jupiter and Neptune. John's possessions fall in the 8th house (the 2nd of the 7th). Aries is on the 8th cusp, making Mars the ruler of his lost game. Seeing Mars in the 3rd house, I asked Sara if he could have left it in the car.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0316" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">"Funny you should ask that;" replied Sara. "John last remembers having the game in the car, but he insists he brought it into the house, and we searched the car and couldn't find it."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">"If you're sure it's in the house," I said, "then it's hidden or secluded (Mars in 3rd house), in the Northeast part of the apartment (3rd house), near heat (Mars in Sagittarius), and also near water (Scorpio on 3rd cusp)."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Sara lives in a condo in New York. Her furnace room and laundry room are in the Northeast part of the condo, and I suggested she search that area. Using the Moon as a timing device, I interpreted its sextile to Mars in fourteen degrees to mean that Sara would find the game in about fourteen days, and that I was sure she would find it.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Glancing at Mars in Sagittarius, I got an image of airplane travel (Sagittarius, 9th house) and told her it might be high up somewhere. In my haste I ignored the traditional wisdom that fire signs (Sagittarius) are mid-level, and water signs (Scorpio on 3rd) are low.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2NS-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Two weeks came and went. No GameBoy showed up. Exactly a month after the question, on February 16, Sara was looking for something in the closet next to the furnace and laundry rooms when she found the game - amidst some clothing stored toward the bottom of the closet in the Northeast part of the condo, near heat and water. I went back to the chart to find out why my timing was so far off. When I checked the ephemeris for February 16, I discovered that Mars (the game) was at 12° 46' Capricorn at 00:00 EST on that date. In other words, she found her son's game when Mars (the game) conjoined the position of Neptune (her son) in the horary chart. When Mars came together with Neptune, the game came back to her son John.</p>

<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2O1-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">I telephoned Sara to tell her the news of this exciting "coincidence"-the Mars/Neptune conjunction. Sara wondered aloud how and why the chart could mirror the events and concerns of a small boy's life with such precision. She then remembered a phrase from her youth about God being aware of even the slightest sparrow that falls. If we could comprehend how God knows even the slightest sparrow that falls, we might understand the essence of horary astrology.</p>
