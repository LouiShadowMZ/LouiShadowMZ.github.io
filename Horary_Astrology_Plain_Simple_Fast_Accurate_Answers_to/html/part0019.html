<h1 class="cl-chaptername">A Potpourri of Case Examples</h1>
<p class="cl-dropcapparagraph"><img alt="" class="calibre5" src="../resources/00077.jpeg"/>
 n this chapter I will present several horary examples. My goal throughout has been to teach the reader to think like a horary astrologer. The examples here show the diversity of matters that horary analysis can address. I have included charts where I was wrong as well as those where I got the right answer. The reader may wish to apply other methods of horary interpretation to these examples to test which rules are effective.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 38: "WHERE ARE MY KEYS?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">People are always misplacing their keys. On December 9, 1989, my wife's parents were visiting from out of state. My mother-in-law discovered that her house keys were missing and at 2:26 P.M. asked me to do a chart to find them. See Chart 38.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">There are no classical considerations before judgment. The 7th cusp represents me, the astrologer. Scorpio is on the cusp and both Mars and Pluto, the rulers of Scorpio, are contained within the 7th house in the Via Combusta. Because my ruler is Via Combust and therefore afflicted, I may have some problems reading the chart or satisfying the querent. Jacobson regards Pluto in the 7th as a modern stricture similar in nature to Saturn in the 7th.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2F7-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Gemini is on the cusp of the 2nd house of movable goods. Mercury signifies the lost keys. Mercury and Uranus are the natural rulers of keys. Both Mercury and Uranus are in Capricorn in the 8th house. I tell my wife's mother that her keys are either at ground level or on the floor (Capricorn), probably in a dark place, near water or plumbing (8th house), possibly near garbage (8th), southwest (8th) and then south (Capricorn). She remembers using the keys to re-enter her upstairs condominium from the ground level garage just before the trip. There are a garbage can and some pipes near the garage entrance to the condo. She thinks she might have left the keys in the door inside the garage which is now dark with its door shut and the lights off. I can't wait till she finds out if the analysis is correct.</p>

<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 38: "Where Are My House Keys?" December 9, 1989, 2:26 P.M. EST 73W01 /41 N19 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">About 9:30 P.M. the same day my father-in-law reached into his pocket and discovered he had the missing keys. My interpretation was incorrect. I go back to the chart and notice the following. The Moon, co-ruler of lost objects, is 7° from the Ascendant, my mother-in-law. In seven hours she got her keys back.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The 7th house represents my father-in-law because he is the querent's spouse. At the time my wife's mother asked the question, my father-in-law was sitting on a couch against the south wall of the TV room, which was southwest of us.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The 8th house represents my father-in-law's possessions. I had not considered derivative houses in trying to locate the missing items. The keys were indeed with my father-in-law's possessions (8th house) in his pants pocket. They were also in a dark place (the pocket), and near his personal plumbing and water; the 8th house rules the body's organs of sex and elimination. In addition, Mercury (the keys) last conjoined the sun (a man, a father) and will next conjoin Uranus (sudden or unexpected discovery). The chart made sense, but only after I knew the right answer. You can't win them all!</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 39: "WHERE Is NICK?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">This is a missing person chart, of sorts. I met Nick through a local computer bulletin board. He was interested in astrology and we corresponded by computer. We also met for lunch a couple of times. Nick is an excellent computer programmer and works at it free-lance. When he learned I was a psychiatrist, Nick told me he suffered from recurrent depressions that periodically impaired his ability to work. For several weeks Nick did not respond to messages I left him on the bulletin board. Finally, the sys-op deleted his name from the user list, which meant that he had not called in for some time. I became concerned and on June 4, 1989, at 7:00 A.M. EDT asked the horary question, "Where is Nick?" See Chart 39.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0268" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Saturn is in the 7th house representing the astrologer. Is this a stricture against judgment (meaning I will have difficulty reading this chart)? Or, does it describe Nick who may possibly be represented by the 7th house as a person with whom I have dealings?</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">If the 7th does represent Nick, he should be due west of me (7th-a western house) and at home because his ruler, Saturn, is in his own first house. Saturn has passed a conjunction with Neptune and in now retrograde and returning to conjoin Neptune again. Perhaps my worry that Nick has been depressed is correct. The retrograde significators in the 7th mean that I will be able to re-establish contact with Nick.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Later that day I telephoned Nick at his apartment. He was home (due east of me) and told me he had been depressed because his computer died and he could not afford the repairs. He said he was feeling fine now except for his broken computer. As the chart suggested, he again became depressed toward the end of the summer and was unable to work for several weeks.</p>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00079.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered" id="2FL-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Chart 39: "Where Is Nick?" June 4, 1989, 7:00 A.m. EDT 73W01 /41 N19 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0269" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In re-analyzing this chart for the second edition of this book, I realized that Nick was due East and not due West of my location. With a retrograde Saturn in the 7th, I must have been in error in my original interpretation. Most likely, I should have taken the 11th house for Nick, an acquaintance or friend, rather than the 7th. With a Taurus 11th cusp, Venus becomes Nick's ruler. Venus lies at the end of Gemini (in the terms of Mars) and in the unfortunate 12th house, reflecting his depressed state. Venus is close to the Ascendant, implying that Nick is due East of me, as he indeed was. Ascendant ruler, the Moon (me), will conjoin Venus (Nick), which is herself applying to conjoin the Ascendant (me). Thus, we will be reunited. Mercury retrograde in the 11th probably symbolizes Nick's broken computer at home in Nick's turned 1st house.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 40: "WHERE Is TOMMY?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Another missing person chart. Tommy is a teenage boy I had worked with clinically. His parents were divorced and he lived with his mother. Although he had always been a good student, in the current school year he began "hanging out with a bad crowd," skipping school, and getting failing grades. His mother was concerned that he might be using drugs, which he adamantly denied.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">On June 19, 1989, at 1:09 P.M. EST, his mother called me in a panic to say that Tommy had run away. The night before she had confronted him about some marijuana she found in his room. The next day he left a note that he did not like her checking up on him and he was leaving. See Chart 40.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">At this time I knew both the mother and son fairly well. Although Tommy had an exterior toughness and bravado, I knew he was a frightened, dependent child underneath. I reassured the mother that I believed her son would soon return, but I told her to notify the police of the runaway for her son's safety. When I got home that evening, I cast the chart for my own edification. At the time I was using McEver's system of taking the 7th for persons specifically referred to by name. Because the mother had mentioned her son by name, I used the 7th as Tommy's primary ruler. In addition, Tommy, as one of my clients, could be represented by the Aries 7th house, and its feisty ruler Mars does represent young men. Because Tommy was her son, I also used the 5th house (children) as his ruler. The Moon naturally governs runaways.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In a sense this is a chart with two querents. Not knowing of my interest in astrology, the mother called me as her counselor to ask about the welfare of her son. I conceived the idea of asking the horary question to satisfy both myself and the mother of the answer. From my perspective the son is the 7th house client. From the mother's perspective the son is the 5th house of children.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2FT-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">There are no considerations before judgment present. The Part of Fortune is near the 7th cusp, so my client Tommy is safe. His ruler, Mars, is in the 10th in Leo. He probably went south to a park or place of amusement (Leo). Because Leo is on the 11th cusp, he may be with friends. Mars (the young man) will sextile the Ascendant (querent mother) in about eleven and a half degrees, suggesting that he may return in by midnight. Tommy's other rulers are Saturn, Uranus, and the Moon. Saturn and Uranus are both retrograde in Capricorn in the 3rd house. Retrograde significators show that he will return. The 3rd house suggests he is in the neighborhood, and its Sagittarius cusp suggests he may be outdoors.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0270" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon is also in the 3rd house in Capricorn. Luna has just left a conjunction with Uranus (breaks, running away) and is moving forward to join Neptune (drugs, deception). Immediately after joining Neptune, the Moon will go on the conjoin Saturn (loneliness, abandonment) and then will enter the 4th house (home). Furthermore, the Moon (the fugitive Tommy) is in early Capricorn in the terms of Venus (the querent mother-Libra rising) and Venus lies in Cancer, ruled by the Moon. This mutual reception suggests that the runaway Tommy will return to his mother.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I understood the chart to mean that Tommy had recently run away. He went south to a park or place of amusement with some friends. The future aspects of the Moon suggest he will do some drugs, begin to feel lonely, and return home. The mother called me the next day to report that Tommy had come home the previous evening. He indeed had gone to a park with some friends. He, of course, denied any drug use. I do not know what direction the park is from his house.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 41: "WILL I GO TO JAIL?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">In my work I come across unusual people and situations. The following chart refers to a woman who came to see me in the hospital clinic. I had read about this woman in the local newspapers. She was on trial for participating in an embezzlement and was trying to use her history of psychological problems to avoid going to jail. The sentencing was a week away and she was feeling overwhelmed with anxiety.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0272" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00080.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 40: "Where Is Tommy?" June 19, 1989, 1:09 P.m. EST, 72W55/41 N18 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0273" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">At one point in the interview she said, "You can't tell me if I'm going to jail." I glanced at the clock and did a chart that evening to see for myself if it would answer her question. Although she did not request a horary chart, the matter was most pressing to her when she asked the question. Chart 41 is for September 21, 1989, at 2:04 P.M. EST.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The chart appears radical. Capricorn rising reflects her serious and depressed state of mind. Her ruler, Saturn, is in the 12th house of imprisonment and self-undoing. Saturn is two degrees away from a conjunction with Neptune, the natural ruler of confinement and sorrow. As an occupant of the 12th house, Neptune is a co-ruler of imprisonment in this chart. It looks like she will go to jail.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The primary ruler of the 12th (jails) is Jupiter in Cancer in the 6th. Jupiter has recently passed an opposition to Saturn (the querent). Unfortunately, Jupiter will turn retrograde and again oppose Saturn in November. I took this to mean that within two months she will be in jail. For confirmation, I looked at the final aspect of the Moon. It is a square to the Sun in the 9th house of legal proceedings, confirming a negative outcome. The Moon is also within orb of squaring Mars, ruler of the 11th of her hopes and wishes, and of opposing Uranus, posited in the 12th of imprisonment.</p>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00081.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered" id="2GB-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Chart 41: Will I go to jail? September 21, 1989, 2:04 P.M. EST, 72W55, 41 N18 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0274" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In addition, Mars co-rules the querent because he is Almuten with Saturn of the Ascendant. Mars lies in the 9th of legal matters in Libra, the sign of his detriment, and under the sunbeams. Mars is also conjunct the contrascion of the Sun (ruler of the unfortunate 8th house and posited in the 9th). This is similar to Mars square the Sun and is another indicator of misfortune. Mars (the querent) is also applying to a square of Jupiter (imprisonment).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I read in the paper the following week that she was sentenced to five years in prison.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 42: "WILL LING-LING'S BABY LIVE?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On Friday, September 1, 1989, I heard the news that Ling-Ling, the giant panda bear at the Washington Zoo, had given birth. The zookeepers were afraid that the baby panda would not live because Ling-Ling had lost her other children born in captivity. At 5:54 P.M. EST I asked the question, "Will Ling-Ling's baby survive?" See Chart 42.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Almost 29° of Aquarius is rising. The question may be too late. The baby's fate may already be decided. The news report said that the baby had an infection. The Moon lies at the end of Virgo in the unfortunate terms of Mars. The Moon is Void of Course in the modern definition, suggesting that matters will not go handsomely forward.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I took the 12th house of large animals for Ling-Ling. To find Ling-Ling's baby, I counted to the fifth of the 12th which is the natural 4th house. Gemini is on the 4th cusp so Mercury rules the baby. The house ruling the baby's death is the eighth of the 4th or the natural 11th house of the chart. Capricorn is on the 11th cusp so Saturn rules the baby's death. Saturn is also a natural ruler of death. Both Saturn and Neptune occupy the 11th house, making Neptune a co-ruler of the baby's death.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0276" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00082.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 42: "Will Ling-Ling's Baby Live?" September 1, 1989, 5:54 P.M. EST, 73W01, 41 N19 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0277" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Saturn, primary ruler of the baby's 8th, retrograde in the baby's 8th and approaching the cusp of the baby's house of death suggests the baby will die. Mercury (the baby) at 6° 18' Libra is applying to a square with Saturn (baby's death) at 7° 22' Capricorn. Retrograde Saturn simultaneously applies to the square with Mercury. This mutual application makes the aspect more powerful. Mercury is cardinal and angular and is a little over a degree away from squaring Saturn and then conjoining the radical Koch 8th cusp of death. Mercury also rules the 4th house end of the matter of the question. The baby will die in a little over a day.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Ling-Ling's baby died at 12:20 A.M. EDT on Sunday morning, September 3, 1989, a little over a day after I cast the chart.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 43: "WILL CICIPPIO BE HANGED?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">This chart is for another event in the news, one that deeply disturbed me. In early August, 1989, Middle Eastern terrorists murdered American hostage William Higgins and threatened to hang another hostage, Joseph Cicippio, by day's end. On August 3, 1989, at 8:32 A.M. EST, when I was feeling most upset by the new broadcast, I asked the horary question, "Will Cicippio be hanged?" See Chart 43.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">There are no considerations before judgment present. The Moon occupies the 12th house of confinement fits a chart about a hostage. Mutable signs occupy all the angles, showing a volatile situation. The Part of Fortune rising in the 1st house is an encouraging sign.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I used McEvers' method of assigning the 7th house to Cicippio, the person inquired about and with whom I had no other relationship. Pisces is on the cusp. His primary ruler is Jupiter and his secondary ruler, Neptune. Jupiter is strong in the 10th house and exalted in Cancer. These are fortunate indications and would confirm a favorable outcome. Jupiter is in a critical degree, at 0° of a cardinal sign. Critical degrees signify crisis situations and, without a doubt, Cicippio faced a crisis.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The question is about Cicippio's death. His eighth house is the eighth of the 7th, or the natural 2nd house of the chart. Libra is on the 2nd cusp. Actually, 23° 21' Libra is on the 2nd cusp, Koch system. This is the ecliptic longitude of Spica (23° 41' Libra in 1989), the most benefic fixed star. Thank God! Spica will almost certainly prevent the hanging from taking place. The rulers of Cicippio's derivative eighth house are Venus (Libra on the cusp) and secondarily Pluto (in the 2nd house). Venus (primary ruler of his death) and Jupiter (primary ruler of Cicippio) make no aspect. No aspect, no action. Good news again. Jupiter (Cicippio) will eventually trine Pluto (co-ruler of his death). This trine is a long way off, ephemeris time, and is a favorable indication. Neptune (Cicippio's co-ruler) is retrograde, showing his eventual return.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I felt relieved after reading this chart. The news reports from the Middle East confirmed my interpretation. The terrorists decided to spare Cicippio's life for the time being. Unfortunately, Neptune moves toward a conjunction with Saturn in the chart, and Saturn rules Cicippio's derivative 12th house of confinement. Although the chart promises he will not be hanged at this time, it suggests he is moving toward a prolonged period (Saturn) of confinement (12th house). When I wrote this in December, 1989, Cicippio was still a hostage. After a long period of confinement, he was eventually released by his captors.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0278" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Traditional astrologers might object to taking the 7th to represent Cicippio and use instead the 12th house. According to Lilly, captives and imprisonment are signified by planets in the 6th and 12th houses, by planets under the sunbeams, and by the cusp and planetary ruler of the 12th house (CA, pp. 463 and 470). With a Leo 12th cusp, the Sun would represent Cicippio. The Sun is dignified in Leo and in the fortunate 11th house. Jupiter, ruling the 7th, would become the significator of the 8th of death of the 12th of hostages. Sun and Jupiter make no aspect. The Sun (Cicippio) will square Pluto (a modern planet not used in traditional horary) and will also sextile the Part of Fortune.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon, which occupies the 12th and therefore also signifies the hostage, is applying only to favorable aspects (trine Saturn, trine Neptune, sextile Pluto, and finally conjunct Venus). If we take Mercury at the cusp of the 12th to signify Cicippio, Mercury will perfect no aspects while in its sign. Before leaving Leo, Mercury will conjoin Regulus which Lilly considered the most beneficent of all the fixed stars. When Mercury enters Virgo, it will conjoin Mars (ruler of the 3rd = end-of-the-matter of the 12th) and then quickly sextile Jupiter (ruler of the end-of-the-matter 4th of the radical chart). By traditional methods, it does not appear that Cicippio will be hanged.</p>

<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">A historical note: Joseph Cicippio was taken hostage in Beirut, Lebanon, on September 12, 1986. After spending over five years in captivity, he was released on December 2, 1991.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 44: "WILL I MARRY MICHAEL?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">My friend Marie is a single parent who has the greatest difficulty in her relationships with men. For several years she has been asking horary questions about various relationships and the answer is always "no." She has a knack for inquiring when the Moon is void of course or when other strictures appear in the chart. As an aside, my experience and that of other horary astrologers, is that relationship questions frequently have "no" answers. If you think about it, the reason is obvious. People who are engaged in gratifying relationships do not ask horary questions about whether things will work out. Only when troubles arise is the querent prompted to make a horary inquiry, and by then it's usually too late.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">On August 29, 1987, at 3:01 P.M. EST, Marie asked the question, "Will I marry Michael?" The man in question is the brother of one of Marie's friends. Marie had had a long-standing crush on Michael and had dated him for a while. When she heard that Michael had become engaged, she called me to ask her horary question. The reality of the situation suggested that Marie will not marry Michael. Let's see what Chart 44 shows.</p>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00084.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 44: "Will I Marry Michael?" August 29, 1987, 3:01 P.M. EST, 73W01, 41 N19 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0280" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Ascendant is 2° Capricorn. As usual, Marie's relationship question produced a chart with a classical consideration before judgment. Early degrees rising often mean a premature question. In this case, I would use the Bonatus rule that early degrees show a trivial or insincere question. Marie must realize that the situation between her and Michael is hopeless.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Neptune is retrograde in Capricorn and approaching the Ascendant. Neptune, as Marie's co-ruler, shows her state of self-deception. The thoughts about Michael are a pipe-dream (Neptune). Marie's primary ruler, Saturn, is in the 12th house of illusion, unreality, and self-undoing. Michael's ruler is the Moon because Cancer is on the Descendant. The Moon is in the Via Combusta, another classical warning. How does Marie pick these times to ask her questions? Two strictures in the same chart! This is another indication that things will not work out with Michael. The Moon (always the querent's co-ruler) is also conjunct Pluto, indicating her obsession with marrying this man.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon (as ruler of the 7th or Michael) makes no major aspect to Marie's rulers Saturn and Neptune. The Moon will semi-sextile Saturn in 7° from the 12th house side of Saturn. The semi-sextile is a 2nd and 12th house aspect, and again confirms that Marie is deluding herself. Michael, of course, continued with his engagement and married someone else.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 45: "WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME OF MRS. B's LIVER TRANSPLANT?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">A nurse, whom I know through work, was born with a congenital liver problem. Her condition worsened gradually into middle age. Her doctors finally decided it was time to have a liver transplant. She waited months for a liver donor. Suddenly in late July, 1989, a liver became available. I heard the news of the liver donor on July 27, 1989, at 8:16 A.M. EST and cast a chart for that time. My question was, "What will be the outcome of Mrs. B's liver transplant surgery?" See Chart 45.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">This chart resembles the Cicippio chart above. According to McEvers' method of assigning the 7th cusp to Mrs. B, her primary ruler is Jupiter and her co-ruler is Neptune. The Mutable angles suggest an unstable situation. Jupiter (Mrs. B) is in a critical last degree of a sign. She is in a crisis situation and about to undergo a change of state. Jupiter, the natural ruler of the liver, is about to pass from Gemini into Cancer. At 29°, her liver (Jupiter) is "at the end of its rope." Mrs. B is about to have a liver transplant. The chart is radical and the symbolism fits the situation remarkably well.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Jupiter is strong in the 10th house, a positive indication. At the end of Gemini, Jupiter is in the terms of Mars (surgery). The natural 2nd house is Mrs. B's house of surgery because it is the eighth house of the 7th (Mrs. B). Libra is on the 2nd cusp. Venus is the primary ruler of the surgery. Pluto, in the 2nd, is the co-ruler of the surgery. Mrs. B's primary ruler, Jupiter, is void of course (modern), suggesting the matter is out of her hands. Her co-ruler, Neptune, is mutually applying to a trine with Venus (the surgery). The trine suggests a positive outcome. Her co-ruler, the Moon, is also in a critical degree at 0° 35' Gemini. This confirms her crisis state, as if we needed any confirmation. The Moon will square Venus (the surgery), suggesting obstacles or problems to be overcome. The Moon will quincunx Pluto, co-ruler of the surgery and natural ruler of complications, implying necessary adjustment and restructuring, apt symbolism for a liver transplant and the recovery after surgery. The last aspect of the Moon would be a conjunction with Jupiter, implying a positive outcome.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0281" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I found this chart difficult to synthesize. There were mixed indications of a favorable and a difficult outcome. The course of events fit the mixed nature of the chart. The surgery was successful, but Mrs. B developed many post-operative complications (Pluto). She needed to remain in the hospital for more than three months to receive antibiotic treatment and intensive rehabilitation. She finally went home in early November, and the liver transplant appears successful.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Traditional horary astrologers might approach this chart differently. Lilly taught that "in questions concerning sick people, give the Ascendant and his lord and the lord of the figure for significators of the sick party" (CA, p. 282). Virgo (the sign of caring for the sick) rising fits a question about a nurse and a medical problem. Mercury rules Mrs. B and is about to enter the 12th house of hospitals. The Sun has the most dignity and is "lord of the figure." The chart appears radical from this perspective.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2HM-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Mercury is out of orb and thus void of course in Lilly's sense of the term. The Moon, which shows the general action in the chart, will next square Venus in the 12th (suggesting a difficult hospitalization) and then sextile the Sun in the 11th of her hopes and wishes, suggesting a positive outcome. In addition, the Sun, as most dignified "lord of the figure;' represents Mrs. B. The Sun is Almuten of the 8th of surgery and of the 12th of hospitalization, thus linking the sick person with her surgery, hospitalization, and hopes and wishes. The Sun's great dignity suggests that these matters should go well.</p>

<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 46: ABOUT A SMALL LION: WILL HE BE TAMED?</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">This is a typical fifth-century horary question analyzed by Palchus in Alexandria, Egypt, and reported in the book Greek Horoscopes by Neugebaur and Van Hoesen. The querent wanted to know if he could tame a young lion before spending a lot of money on a new pet. The question is dated July 8, A.D. 483 at 6:20 A.M. LMT, 29E55/31N13. See Chart 46.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Palchus, using fifth-century rules, argued that the Ascendant at 2° Leo fit a question about a young lion. Palchus thought the lion would be tamed because of the house positions of the two benefics; Venus was rising in Leo in the 1st house, and Jupiter was in the 11th house of the Good Daemon, where he rejoices. Furthermore, the Moon, co-ruler of the querent, would soon trine Jupiter, primary ruler of the querent's domestic animals (6th house). Jupiter is also the natural ruler of large or wild animals represented by the 12th house. Palchus said that the lion would go abroad on a ship because the Moon and the Lot of Fortune (by his calculations) were in the setting sign Aquarius, which is watery. Again, we see the water symbolism of Aquarius, as in Simmonite's example of the absconded mother.</p>

<div class="calibre3" id="page0285" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The computer chart has the Part of Fortune at 2° Pisces. Palchus calculated Pars Fortuna by hand from the tables available to him. The 5th century figures placed Pars Fortuna at 28° Aquarius. Palchus thought the lion would go abroad because the Moon had just left an opposition with Venus in the 1st (the "sender" of the Moon) and was about to trine Jupiter (the "receiver" of the Moon), natural ruler of long voyages, in Gemini (travel) in the 11th.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 47: "WHERE DID I PUT THE MEDICATION?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">The same weekend my mother-in-law lost her house keys, she asked a horary question to locate some medication she bought for her husband the week before. She remembered bringing it home but could not find it anywhere. On December 8, 1989, a Friday, at 9:39 P.M. EST she asked, "Where did I put the medication?" She knew it was in her home. See Chart 47.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The chart appears radical. Hypochondriacal Virgo on the 2nd cusp fits a question about missing medication. The 2nd ruler is Mercury which resides in Capricorn in the 5th house. McEvers would consider only the position of the 2nd ruler Mercury and tell us to look northwest (5th house) and then south (Capricorn). The missing medication may be in a dark place, low down, or on the floor (all suggested by Capricorn).</p>

<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Jacobson follows the houses first, then the signs. Using Jacobson's method, I told my mother-in-law to follow these directions upon her return: "First go north and west (directions taken from the mundane houses) in your condo and then go directly south (Capricorn). Look low down in a dark place (Capricorn). It may be near a heat vent (Moon in Aries; Sagittarius on 5th cusp)'</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">When my mother-in-law returned home after visiting us for the weekend, she followed the directions exactly as I had given them. She went north and west in her condo and this took her into the living room. From the northwest corner of the living room she turned south. This led to the entrance to her bedroom facing a closet. She opened the closet and there on a shelf, midway up, was the lost medication. She had looked for the medication in this closet several times during the previous week but did not see the missing item. In the attic above the closet is the heat pump for her condo.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Both she and I were astonished at how directly the horary instructions took her to the hidden goods. In retrospect, I realized I had not paid enough attention to the fire signs (Moon in Aries and Sagittarius on the 5th house cusp). If I had, I would have told her to look midway up because fire signs signify middle levels.</p>

<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Ed Perrone is an excellent astrologer who writes a monthly feature for American Astrology magazine. I used to correspond with Ed on CompuServe, which Ed was trying to convince to start an astrology forum. One day Ed left me the following message:</p>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered2"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/svgimg0053.svg"/>
</p>
<p class="cl-7italictext">Dear Tony,</p>
<p class="cl-8indeditalicpara" id="2IH-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Okay-here's a horary question that won't destroy me emotionally if the wrong answer comes up. Will the Astrologers Forum be approved by CompuServe? If so, will it go over? Also (if you can tell this from the chart), what sort of direction should I take to increase its chances of approval/success?</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0287" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">See Chart 48. Here is my response:</p>
<p class="cl-7italictext">Dear Ed,</p>
<p class="cl-8indeditalicpara">I read your question at 9:26 P.M. EDT, 73W01, 41N19 on 6/7/89. Only 2° of Capricorn are rising so it may be too early to tell if the Forum will succeed. Uranus (astrology) is on the Ascendant so it appears to be a valid chart.</p>
<p class="cl-9indeditalicparar">I used the 11th for the Astrologers Forum, which is a club. Scorpio is on the 11th so Mars and Pluto rule the Forum. If I use the 3rd house (Pisces cusp) for a communication network like Compuserve, there are no major aspects between Jupiter/Neptune (rulers of the 3rd represent CompuServe) and Mars/Pluto (rulers of the 11th) represent the Forum. No aspects suggests nothing will happen.</p>
<p class="cl-9indeditalicparar">If I use the 7th house (Cancer cusp) as other party for CompuServe, there is a square between the 7th ruler Moon and the I 1 th co-ruler Pluto. That's not too encouraging. It doesn't look like they will approve the Forum.</p>
<p class="cl-9indeditalicparar">As for increasing the chances of approval, Pars Fortuna is in the 2nd house, and Jupiter and the Sun are in the 6th. To increase the chance of success, I think you would need to convince CompuServe that it would bring them more money (2nd house) and provide a needed service (6th house). Also you would need to do a lot of detailed and tedious (6th house) work getting people to write in support of the idea.</p>

<p class="cl-9indeditalicparar">Finally, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn all retrograde in the 1st house suggest that at this time Compuserve is not favorably disposed to the idea. But it's very early in the project (2° rising) and anything can happen (Uranus conjunct Ascendant in 1st).</p>

<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 49: "WHEN WILL MY SON BE TOILET TRAINED?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On the Friday before Christmas, 12/22/89, a good friend was visiting. In the course of the evening she mentioned how her 3 1/2 year old son was refusing to give up his diaper. He was the only child in his nursery school still requiring a diaper. His mother asked if I could do a chart to tell when her son would be fully toilet trained and no longer require a diaper. I noted the time to be 9:43 P.M. EST, coordinates 73W01/41N19. (The child was born 6/7/86 about 10:30 A.M. at 72W55/41N18.) See Chart 49.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon is in the Via Combusta at 5° 9' Scorpio. Normally this consideration would concern me, but the boy's natal Pluto is almost exactly conjunct the horary Moon, and Pluto and Scorpio are both connected with bodily elimination. In addition, the Via Combusta often refers to messy situations. I thought the chart was radical and fit to judge.</p>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" class="calibre4" src="../resources/00089.jpeg"/>
<p class="cl-fixedleftreclustered">Chart 49: "When Will My Son Be Toilet Trained?" December 22, 1989, 9:43 P.M. EST, 73W01, 41 N19 Koch Houses</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0289" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The 5th house rules the child in question. Capricorn is on the 5th cusp so Saturn is the primary ruler of the boy. I reasoned that the child's toilet training would be ruled by his 8th house, which is the 8th of the 5th or the 12th house of the horary chart. The 12th house has Leo on the cusp so the sun rules his toilet training.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The sun is at 1° 15' Capricorn. Sol will conjoin the 5th cusp in 7° (Koch) or 8° (Regiomontanus). The sun will conjoin Saturn (the boy) in 13°. Because the sun is angular and cardinal, I first thought the boy would be toilet trained in between 7 and 13 days. However, he had been quite stubborn about continuing to wear a diaper so I ignored the traditional rule about timing and opted to tell his mother he would stop wearing a diaper within 7 to 13 weeks. In addition, the sun would conjoin Uranus and Neptune on its way to the conjunction with Saturn. I interpreted these conjunctions to mean that the boy would have some accidents along the way, first a bowel and secondly a bladder accident.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In mid-January, 1990, I checked with my friend about her son's toilet training. She said that he stopped wearing a diaper at home on either January 5th or 6th, she couldn't remember which date. January 5th was 13 days after I did the horary chart. January 6th was the date the sun conjoined Saturn ephemeris time. On January 10th he stopped wearing a diaper to nursery school. Some time around January 6th he had a bowel accident while trying without a diaper. He ceased wearing a diaper entirely after that accident.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 50: "WILL THIS BOOK BE PUBLISHED?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">After studying hundreds of horary charts and doing much reading, I wanted to write a book on horary astrology. In the summer of 1989 I decided to ask a horary question before proceeding because I did not want to spend months writing something that would not see the light of day. On July 2, 1989, at 9:06 P.M. EST, I asked the horary question, "Will this book be published?" See Chart 50.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The chart appears radical. Aquarius rising fits a book about astrology. The sun, Moon, and Mercury are all in the 5th house of creative activity. Jupiter in the 5th seems to promise that creative writing will go well. With Aquarius rising, my primary ruler is Saturn and my co-ruler is Uranus. Both these planets are retrograde in Capricorn in the 11th house of astrology. The retrograde status of these planets fits with my plan to review the history of horary astrology. They do not refer to my debilitated state because I found writing this book quite invigorating. Perhaps my retrograde significators anticipate critical reviews that will call my horary thinking backward and atavistic. Time will tell.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The 3rd house rules books and the 9th house rules publishing. With Aries on the 3rd cusp, Mars signifies the book. With Libra on the 9th cusp, Venus is primary ruler of its publication. Because Pluto occupies the 9th house, Pluto is a secondary ruler of publishing.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Are there any aspects between Mars (the book) and either Venus or Pluto (publication)? In less than six degrees, Venus at 4° 36' Leo will conjoin Mars at 10° 17' Leo in the 6th house. The conjunction between the two primary rulers is a strong indication that the book will be published. Perfection in six degrees suggests it will take about six months (not six years, I hoped) to get the manuscript to the publisher. The 6th house fits the tedious work that goes into writing a manuscript.</p>

</div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">On the other hand, Mars (the book) will square Pluto (secondary ruler of publication), and Pluto is in the Via Combusta. This aspect to a secondary ruler carries less weight but may indicate some problems along the way. Perhaps it is a foreshadowing of the theft of the manuscript which delayed my getting it to the publisher, or perhaps it indicates some other problem I am not yet aware of. The Moon is approaching a conjunction with the sun. This is a traditional malefic influence in horary which I tend to ignore. The New Moon in the 5th symbolizes a new beginning and fits my pending decision to begin work on a creative project.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon's last major aspect in this chart is a trine to Pluto in the 9th. I take this to mean that in the end, after some problem shown by Mars square Pluto, the book (Moon as co-ruler) will be published (trine Pluto in 9th). The Part of Fortune having just risen and the Moon's North Node in the 1st house confirm this interpretation.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Addendum: In February 1990, I learned that a well-known horary astrologer was planning to submit a manuscript on horary to Llewellyn and I felt the Mars square Pluto signified this event. Fortunately for me, the other author did a horary chart about whether Llewellyn would publish her manuscript. The answer was negative and she submitted it elsewhere for publication. For a few weeks, however, it seemed like Llewellyn might have to choose between my manuscript and someone else's.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2JK-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">Having read this chart as I did above, I made a decision in July, 1989 to contact some publishers to see if any would be interested in a manuscript on horary astrology. Only three publishers responded to my many inquiries. Two of them had already commissioned other authors to do books on horary, so I found out I had competition.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0291" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Llewellyn expressed interest and asked me to send drafts of some chapters. I began writing the book in mid-summer of 1989 and sent Llewellyn drafts of the initial chapters in September. I had the good fortune to connect with Llewellyn's Tom Bridges, whose thoughtful comments helped shape the structure and content of this volume. I sent the full manuscript to the publisher before the year's end.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">If you are reading this chapter, obviously the book was published and my interpretation of the chart was correct. If you are not reading this material, then I have spent hundreds of hours writing in vain and no one will ever know of my error in analyzing this horary chart.</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 51: "WILL THE AD FLY?"</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On June 5, 1990, at 10:52 A.M. CDT, at 93W06/44N57, Tom Bridges asked his own horary question about whether an advertisement for this book that he wanted to run in American Astrology magazine would be approved by his supervisors at Llewellyn. The ad was moderately expensive and Tom was concerned that his employer might not want to spend that much money on an unknown author's book. See Chart 51.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">With Leo rising in the chart Tom is signified by the Sun. Tom took the 3rd house with a Libra cusp and Venus to represent the ad. Venus is quite dignified, being in her own sign, day triplicity, and term. This augured well for the success of the ad. The 10th house governs Tom's employer, Llewellyn. Taurus is on the 10th cusp, making Venus the ruler of both Tom's boss and the ad. Mercury and the Sun in the 10th are co-rulers of the employer.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The 11th house represents Tom's employer's money. Mercury rules the 11th cusp (Gemini) and Mercury's placement in the 10th shows how carefully Llewellyn guards its money.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The contract for the ad is governed by the 7th house of agreements. As the house of the other party, the 7th also rules American Astrology magazine. The question boils down to this: Will Llewellyn (10th house) or Llewellyn's money (11th house) connect favorably with American Astrology (7th house, ruled by Saturn) or their money (8th house, ruled by Jupiter)?</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The answer is that Mercury (Llewellyn's money) in just about 3° will trine Saturn (American Astrology) by mutual application. Yes, Llewellyn will approve the ad in about three days. The fact that Jupiter (ruler of the 8th, American Astrology's money) is posited in the 11th, Llewellyn's income) and exalted in Cancer suggests that running the ad will ultimately profit Llewellyn.</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Initially Tom did not use this interpretation of the Mercury/Saturn trine to find the answer. Instead, he used the chart to plan a strategy to insure that his boss would approve the ad. Noticing that Saturn was dignified in Capricorn and posited in the 6th, Tom enlisted the aid of a co-worker (6th house) to approach his boss (co-ruled by Mercury in the 10th). He reasoned that the trine would allow his co-worker to easily convince his employer of the ad's worth. His strategy worked and the ad was approved two days later.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The ad "flew" despite the presence of the Moon at 14° 06' Scorpio in the via Combusta. Perhaps what "saved" the Moon is a mixed mutual reception. The Moon is in the terms of Venus, and Venus is in the exaltation of the Moon. Marc Edmond Jones might say that the chart worked despite the Via Combust Moon because Tom was trying to bring order out of confusion.</p>

<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHARTS 52 AND 53: A STUDY IN HORARY ASTROLOGY</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On March 11, 1990, I received a phone call from a woman I hardly knew. To preserve her confidentiality I will refer to her as Rachel. She knew nothing about astrology but had been visiting my friend Sara in New York City when I gave her directions for finding her son's lost video game from a horary chart (see Chapter Fifteen, pp. 247-249). Impressed that the chart located the missing object, she had a question of her own to ask.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Rachel wondered if astrology could tell her what was happening in her marriage. I noted the exact time of the question to be 7:03 P.M. EST. I gave a brief explanation of the difference between horary and natal astrology and asked her for her birth data. Unfortunately, Rachel did not know the exact time of her birth but was certain it was around 9:00 A.M. .</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">For reasons of confidentiality I will not give all of Rachel's birth information. She has an 11th house Sun at 16° Cancer and a 12th house Saturn at 21° Leo. Her natal chart for 9:00 A.M. has 8° Virgo rising with 8° Pisces on her 7th cusp of marriage and husband.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2K5-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">I noticed immediately that her husband's ruler Neptune, now transiting her 5th house in Capricorn, was approaching an opposition to her 11th house Sun. Since Neptune is slow-moving and was about to turn retrograde, she would feel the effect of this opposition for the next couple of years. Her husband's ruler opposing her Sun from her 5th house of love affairs made me wonder if Rachel's husband were having an affair which was causing marital difficulties.</p>

</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0295" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In looking at her secondary progressions, I noticed that her progressed Sun and progressed Saturn were about to conjoin in the 12th house. The conjunction would become exact in the next couple of months. I took this to mean that Rachel might experience some sorrow because of an impending loss or separation.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Having examined her natal chart, transits, and secondary progressions, I next looked at the horary chart for her question "What's happening in my marriage?" See Chart 52.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In this horary chart Rachel is signified by Venus, the ruler of the 1st house. Rachel is also governed by the Moon which always co-rules the person asking the horary question. Her husband's signifier is Mars, the planet which rules the 7th house of the horary chart.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Venus is separating from a conjunction with Mars in Aquarius, and both significators are headed into the 5th house of the horary figure. The separating aspect shows Rachel and her husband pulling apart, and the repeated emphasis on the 5th house again raises the possibility of a love affair. The Moon is void of course (modern), showing that things are not functioning in the marriage and that Rachel is ineffectual in straightening things out.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Because I did not know Rachel very well, I was deliberately vague in reporting my findings to her. I explained that the chart indicated she was headed into a period of stress between herself and her husband. I mentioned nothing about the 5th house emphasis on love affairs, and I apologized for not being very specific in my answer to her.</p>

<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">A few weeks later, on April 8, 1990, I got a second call from Rachel. This time she sounded quite upset, almost in tears. She said her husband had just left her; she then asked two questions: "Will he return, and will I move from New York City?" I noted the time to be 1:50 P.M. EST. See Chart 53.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">With Leo on the Ascendant, the Sun rules Rachel and the Moon is her co-ruler. With Aquarius on the 7th, both Uranus and Saturn, the traditional ruler of Aquarius, signify her husband. The Sun is about to square Saturn, indicating the problems between them. The Moon, which co-rules Rachel, is also about to square both Uranus and Saturn, her husband's two significators. It does not look like he will be returning any time soon.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In addition, both Uranus and Saturn are in the 5th house of the horary figure with Neptune between them. Uranus and Saturn rule her husband in the horary chart, and Neptune rules her husband in her natal chart. I asked Rachel if it was possible that her husband was seeing someone else. "Yes," she said, "an actress" (note Neptune in the 5th). Rachel had just learned her husband had been having an affair (which prompted his moving out).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Will Rachel move from New York City? The 4th house governs her current home base, and the 7th house in horary rules removals. Because Scorpio is on the 4th cusp, Mars rules her home base with Pluto as a co-ruler. The Sun (Rachel) is about to sextile Mars and makes no aspect with Pluto. The sextile indicates that it is better for her to stay in New York City.</p>

<div class="calibre3" id="page0299" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Both Saturn and Uranus govern the 7th cusp of removals. We have already seen the squares these planets form to Rachel's significators. Any attempt to move from New York City would be fraught with obstacles and difficulties. On the other hand, the Sun was a little more than two degrees from the 9th house cusp and would sextile Mars, ruler of the 9th house, in a little over two degrees. I thought this meant she would be taking a trip within two weeks to two months time.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I called Rachel to give her my analysis of the horary chart. I told her that it would be difficult for her and her husband to reunite and that I did not think she would be moving from New York City. I also said I expected she would be taking a long-distance trip within the next couple of months. She then said she was planning to visit her parents in Florida to discuss what had happened in her marriage. She made plane reservations for the last week in April, about two and a half weeks away.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">When I wrote this at the end of June, 1990, Rachel was separated from her husband. They went on to have an acrimonious divorce. Rachel still lives in New York City because she thought a move would be "too drastic."</p>
<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHARTS 54, 55, AND 56: THE CASE OF THE MISSING TWIN</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On Saturday August 24, 1991, at 4:25 P.m., I received a call at my home from the owner of a New Age bookstore where I had recently given a talk on horary astrology. He wanted my help in finding a missing person. See Chart 55 for the time I received the call.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The young man in question was a college student who had disappeared after visiting his girlfriend in Boston for the weekend. He had called home to New Jersey at 1:00 A.M. on July 29, 1991, to let his family know he was leaving his girlfriend's house in Boston and would see them in the morning. See Chart 54 for the time of the family's last contact with the missing twin.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The young man never arrived home and the family feared the worst. His twin brother led the search. About three weeks after the missing student's last phone call to the family, the brother entered the New Age bookstore and asked if there was any occult method for locating his lost brother. The store owner noted the time of the inquiry to be 3:30 P.M. on August 23, 1992. See Chart 56 for the time of the twin brother's inquiry of the store owner.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">I studied all three charts using horary methods and drew the unfortunate conclusion that the missing twin was most likely dead, either from foul play or from an accident.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Chart 54 is of primary importance because it depicts the time the college student was last heard from by his family in New Jersey. William Lilly says that, in missing person charts, the 1st house represents the missing person unless the querent bears some special relationship to the missing party.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2L3-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">In Chart 54 the malefic fixed star Caput Algol conjoins the Ascendant. Algol can symbolize head injuries, beheading, misfortune, and death. Venus rules the Ascendant and hence the missing twin. Venus lies in her fall in Virgo where she conjoins Mars, the natural ruler of accidents and injuries, and the accidental ruler of the 12th house of sorrow and self-undoing.</p>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0300" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Significantly in Chart 54, the Point of Death (Mars + Saturn - MC) lies at 7° Virgo in conjunction with both Venus and Mars! The traditional Part of Death (Ascendant + 8th - Moon) lies at 27° Scorpio exactly opposite the Ascendant which symbolizes the missing person and his physical body. Pluto is quite powerful, having just turned stationary direct, and lies on the midpoint of Mercury (travel) and Saturn (death).</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In Chart 56, for the time when the twin inquires about his missing brother, the querent is shown by the Ascendant and his brother by the 3rd cusp. The missing brother's rulers are Jupiter (traditional ruler of Pisces) and Neptune (modern ruler of Pisces). Neptune is retrograde in the 1st, showing that the missing person will eventually be found (retrograde implies return) but that he will return in a debilitated condition.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In Chart 56 Jupiter, the primary ruler of the missing twin, lies in the 8th house of death. The Moon rules the 8th house (Cancer cusp) and applies by opposition to Jupiter (the missing brother). These are indications that the brother is dead. In the turned chart the derived 8th death house of the 3rd house of the missing brother is the 10th of the horary chart. Venus rules the missing person's house of death (Libra cusp) and occupies the 8th house of the horary chart, another confirmation of death.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon is a natural ruler of fugitives and missing persons and applies to a square of Pluto, a modern ruler of death. Remarkably, the Part of Death in this chart conjoins Caput Algol and the Ascendant of Chart 54.</p>

<div class="calibre3" id="page0301" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In Chart 55 for the time I received the inquiry, the 1st house represents the missing person because I have no natural relationship with the missing twin. Saturn retrograde in the 1st is a traditional warning in horary that "the matter of the question seldom or ever comes to good." Lilly says that Saturn retrograde in the 1st "infortunates the question, causing the querent to despair."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The planets in the 1st house in Chart 55 describe the missing twin. Three retrograde heavy planets (Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) occupy the 1st, suggesting an accident (Uranus) due to carelessness, sleepiness, or drugs (Neptune) and resulting in death (Saturn). In addition, the 8th ruler Sun (Leo cusp) is almost exactly quincunx (150 degrees) the 1st house Saturn. The quincunx is often associated with 6th and 8th house matters like illness and death.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The surviving twin had asked the bookstore owner where his brother might be found. In Chart 56 the 3rd house ruler Jupiter lies in Leo in the 8th house. The 8th house indicates a direction south and west. This made sense because the missing twin was traveling from Boston to New Jersey in a southwest direction. Lilly described Leo as symbolizing places "where wild beasts frequent, woods, forests, desert places, steep rocky places, inaccessible places, and parks."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The young man was found dead shortly after Labor Day in a deserted wooded area alongside Route 84 East in northeastern Connecticut. He had apparently fallen asleep at the wheel, and his car went off the road in a remote, inaccessible area. The car struck a tree and the young man apparently died instantly of a head injury.</p>

<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 57: THE MISSING AUDITORIUM KEYS</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">There is nothing more gratifying to an author than a letter from a grateful reader. In August 1992, I received such a letter from an astrologer in Indiana. The woman who wrote the letter is a teacher who was able to use the first edition of this book to help a colleague find her lost keys. Her fellow teacher was distraught because she had lost the keys to the high school auditorium. Here is an excerpt from her letter to me:</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">"(After school) I managed to quickly run the chart. I spent about twenty minutes on it and consulted your book about the location of objects. I called her about 6:15 P.M. and told her that according to my reading of the chart the keys would be found in her classroom at the school, not in her home or in her car, that they should be at mid-level about waist high, and near something hot or that could be hot in the SE corner of her room."</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph" id="2LN-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">The teacher who had lost the keys drove back to the school that evening. When she entered her classroom, she noticed that her student teacher had pushed an overhead projector on its cart into the southeast corner of the room. She looked on the cart near the projector's bulb that becomes quite hot during operation. There she discovered her missing keys at waist height and wedged between the projector and the top of the cart-just as the horary chart suggested they would be. Study Chart 57 and see if you too can locate the missing keys.</p>

<p class="cl-allcapcenterhead">CHART 58: THE MISSING ORTHODONTIST</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">On October 5, 1992 an orthodontist, Dr. John Susman, disappeared without a trace. Despite a continuing investigation by the East Haven Police and the FBI, he has never been found. According to the New Haven Register of Saturday October 5, 1996, at the time of Dr. Susman's disappearance he had no large debts and was not involved with drugs, gambling, or any kind of illegal activity. He had filed for divorce a year earlier and the separation was amicable. He was a model citizen described as an "easygoing and polite man" who liked wind surfing and tennis.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Dr. Susman was last seen when he left his office in Orange, CT, at 5:15 P.M. EDT on October 5, 1992. At 6:00 P.M. he telephoned his brother from his shorefront home on Long Island Sound and played his brother a message from his answering machine: "Sus, you're a dead man, it's coming soon." The police suspected that the voice on the machine might be that of Dr. Susman but the FBI was not able to confirm this theory. See Chart 58 for the brother's last contact with Dr. Susman.</p>

</div>
<div class="calibre3" id="page0308" title="pagetype_txt"></div>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The next day, October 6, 1992, Dr. Susman did not show up for work. His brother called the police who searched Dr. Susman's home where they found his four wheel drive vehicle and his Mazda still in the driveway. Inside the house the police found the doctor's keys, wallet, clothing, belongings, and $10,000 in cash. There was no sign of violence or forced entry. No one saw him leave and none of the Taxi or transportation companies had any record of giving him a ride.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Lilly advises us to use the 1st house for a missing person. With Aries rising, Mars signifies the orthodontist. Mars rules both the Ascendant and the 8th house of death and is Almuten of the 4th house of the grave. Mars lies in Cancer (oceans) in the end-of-the-matter 4th house. Mars is partile square to the Sun, ruler of the unfortunate 6th of sickness and accidents. The Sun is Almuten of both the l st and 6th houses, connecting the physical state of Dr. Susman with the misfortune represented by the 6th house. As the 8th ruler, Mars squaring the Sun, Almuten of the 1st-the missing person's body, suggests that he may be dead. Mars applies to an opposition of Uranus/Neptune and the Sun applies to a square of both these planets. These aspects suggest some kind of sudden accident, piercing blow, or injury, perhaps due to carelessness or a state of depression or inattention.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Sun (Almuten of the 1st and ruler of the 6th), Mars (ruler of the 1st and the 8th and Almuten of the 4th and 11th), Pluto (a natural ruler of death), and the Moon (missing persons and 4th ruler) are all in critical degrees at the cusps of the Lunar Mansions. This was certainly a critical time in Dr. Susman's life. In addition the Sun and Mars, which signify the orthodontist's body, are both in their fall, indicating a debilitated state. Finally, the Sun (Almuten of the 1st, the orthodontist's body) conjoins the fixed star Algorab (at 13° 20' Libra), which is prominent in cases of loss, accidents, suicide, and injury.</p>

<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The Moon is a general significator of fugitives and missing persons. Here the Moon (4th ruler-final resting place) lies in Aquarius (near water) and mutually applies to a conjunction of Saturn (dark rocky places) near the cusp of the 12th (self-undoing). This symbolism suggests that the orthodontist fell, injured his head or suffered a heart attack (Mars square Sun) in a rocky place (Saturn) near water (Mars in Cancer, Moon in Aquarius). He may have been knocked unconscious and then drowned, the body being hidden near or under rocks along the shore. The mystery remains unsolved as indicated by so many peregrine planets in the chart: the Sun (authorities), Mercury (3rd ruler, the brother), Venus (2nd and 7th ruler, the consultants on the case), Jupiter (9th and 12th ruler, the legal system and private investigators), and the Moon (4th ruler, the family). Eventually we may find out what happened.</p>
<p class="cl-2centerhead">HISTORICAL INTERLUDE WILLIAM LILLY'S BIRTHDAYS</p>
<p class="cl-3nonindpara">William Lilly, the great horary astrologer, was born in the spring of 1602 at Dis- eworth, seven miles south of Derby (52N50, 01W16), when the Julian calendar was still being used in Great Britain. His birth date is listed by various authorities as either April 30 or May 1, 1602 in the Julian calendar. It happens that both dates are correct-depending on one's calendrical perspective.</p>
<p class="cl-4indedpara">At that time in England, days were regarded as beginning at Noon. Because Lilly was born at 2:08 past midnight, his birth date was originally recorded at 14:08 past Noon on April 30. This was later rewritten as 2:08 past midnight on May 1, 1602 by modern authors who considered the day to begin at midnight rather than at Noon.</p>
<p class="cl-4indedpara" id="2MD-a0963e6c45f144669fc471f62c9b901e">To convert these dates to the Gregorian calendar, we need to add ten days. In doing so, we see that William Lilly can have four separate and valid dates of birth: April 30, May 1, May 10, and May 11, 1602.</p>
