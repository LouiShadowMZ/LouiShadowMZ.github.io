<p class="cl-headingsmallcentered">HORARY ASTROLOGY PLAIN &amp; SIMPLE A REVIEW BY BRUCE SCOFIELD</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">This book by Anthony Louis is the most thorough presentation of traditional horary astrology I have seen for a long time. As indicated by the subtitle, it is based on at least two thousand years of astrological divination technique found in the writings of some of the greatest astrologers in history: Ptolemy, Dorotheus, Bonatus, Lilly, Jones, and others.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">The author's knowledge of the history of his subject is remarkable and commendable. There is much to be gained from familiarity with history in any field, but especially so in astrology, which suffers today in part because its roots are deeply buried in the past. Louis is a good historian. He has read the relevant sources. He understands them (something that many historians of science do not), is critical of them, and freely relates when the old techniques prove dubious in modern practice.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In many respects this book can be considered a manual of the Western astrological tradition and, with its emphasis on principles, will admirably serve the general learning needs of beginners, whatever their interest in astrology, as well as any text, old or new, I can think of. Louis relies on both ancient and modern horary authorities to sort through contradictions in the literature and present a coherent methodology for analysis. The use of case studies is a vital part of any book on horary astrology, and the cases in this text are especially varied. His section on finding lost objects is particularly thorough.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Louis is a practicing psychiatrist. His knowledge of psychology adds a great deal to his study and I wish more people from other fields would write on astrology. Throughout the book he maintains a critical and objective attitude toward the subject, using only the techniques that can actually be demonstrated in practice. What's missing-and this is what makes the book so refreshing-is the astrological cheerleading, the warped interpretations of history and over-confidence in the "correctness" of certain traditions. In addition, he enlivens what might be a necessarily tedious read with odd and delightful observations, humor, witticisms and puns.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">In summary, this book is well written, superbly organized, and very readable (quite a feat for a book about one of the most technical branches of traditional astrology). Horary has a lot of specialized terminology, but Louis is at pains to explain it all, providing many examples along the way. Here is a work that is likely to remain on the bookstore shelves for many years-sophisticated, diligent, destined to become a classic.</p>

<p class="cl-headingsmallcentered">About the Author</p>
<p class="cl-nonindentedparagraph">Anthony Louis is a psychiatrist with training in Freudian analysis. It was his interest in symbolism that led to his in-depth study of the history and practice of astrology, and his background in the classics and Latin that enabled him to research the original sources of Western horary astrology. An empirical thinker, he is unwilling to accept astrological rules and practices that are not backed up by hard evidence.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Louis has contributed numerous articles to publications such as American Astrology, The Horary Practitioner, The Ascendant, as well as Llewellyn's Astrological Calendar and Sun Sign Book. He has also written a computer program for Geomancy-another time-honored method of astrological divination, and is the author of Tarot Plain and Simple.</p>
<p class="cl-firstlineindentedparagraph">Below is Anthony Louis' natal chart. He was born on September 3, 1945, 9:04 A.M. EDT, 73W03/41N33. His Sun in the 11th house conjoins a traditional astrological degree-11° Virgo.</p>
