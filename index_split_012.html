	<h1 id="id_Toc184334474" class="block_14">8 HOUSE</h1>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334475" class="block_12">Can I expect Dowry?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Generally, dowry is given in liquid cash or easily cashable valuable metals, jewels, vessels,
		vehicles, etc. These are indicated by the second house. Since the consultant is expecting dowry from his or her
		partner, then the second house to the 7th indicates the value of the dowry, and the houses 6 and 11 denote the
		partner giving the money as present and the consultant accepting it. Therefore, the sublord of the eighth cusp
		must be deposited in the constellation of the planet who signifies the matters of the houses 6 and 11. But if
		the sublord of the eighth cusp happens to be the significator of 5 and 12, then the consultant is to give.
		Therefore, who will give to whom is to be ascertained.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Then the extent to which one can have the dowry has to be judged, from the strength of the lord
		of the constellation in which the sublord of the 11th is deposited. The sublord of the 11th may be debilitated.
		Yet, if it were to be in the constellation of a planet which is exalted, then most satisfactory dowry will be
		received.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Even though the sublord of the 11th cusp may be exalted, yet if it is in the constellation of a
		planet which is debilitated, then the dowri will be less.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Let me compare the debilitated planet for a small container and exalted planet for a big one. If
		a debilitated planet is a small packet, then the exalted planet, in whose constellation the debilitated planet
		is, will be similar to diamond in that small packet. Similarly the exalted planet is the huge container who is
		in the constellation of debilitated planet which shows that the content's value is less like cotton ball. A big
		cotton packet is not as valuable as a small packet of diamond. Small packet is the debilitated sublord. Diamond
		is the exalted constellation lord.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">This is the way how we have to find out whether a debilitated planet or exalted planet maintains
		its strength.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334476" class="block_12">Will he be chaste?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">If the sublord of the 7th or the planet in whose constellation the sublord is deposited is
		neither Mercury nor one occupying a dual sign and also if the sublord of the 11th is in the constellation of a
		planet signifying the 7th house, the person will remain the chaste. When the sublord of the 11th is in the
		constellation of the planet signifying the 6th even thought one may be moving with the other sex, yet the other
		sex will not permit to proceed beyond a particular limit and thereby the person has to necessarily remain
		chaste.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334477" class="block_12">I Will I get scholarship?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Scholarship means non-refundable loan with a string attached to it. For loan one is to judge the
		houses 2 and 6.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">If it need not be returned, it amounts to gift, when we have to judge the houses 2 and 11.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence he who can fulfil the conditions and enjoy the scholarship will have the sublord of the
		11th cusp deposited in the constellation of a planet who is the significator of 2, 6 and 11 and should not be a
		significator of 8 or 12. But he who gets the scholarship and then he is to repay will have the sub- lord of the
		11th cusp deposited in the constellation of the planet which is the significator of not only 2 or 6 or 11 and
		also 8 or 12. Because, 2, 6, 11 houses show the gain of money by borrowing or accepting any money given by
		another whereas 8 and 12 houses indicate return or refund or lending money to another.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334478" class="block_12">Will I get any donation?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">For donation judge the houses 2, 6 and 11. Any money received means your bank position
		improves-indicated by second house. As it is given by another, to that extent it is a loss to him, the giver. As
		it is a donation which need not be returned it is in full a profit. This is indicated by the 11th house. As the
		giver is indicated by the 7th house loss to him is shown by the 12th to the 7th,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In horary astrology, see that the sub-lord of the 8th is in the constellation of a planet who is
		the significator of the 6th. The sub-lord of the 6th is the significator of 2 or 6 or 11. Then getting a
		donation is promised.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334479" class="block_12">Will I get money by way of Will from my uncle?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">How is he your uncle? He is my father's elder brother. Next elder to him!</p>
	<p class="block_4">Yes, Sir, my grandfather had only two sons. So my uncle is the only elder to him.</p>
	<p class="block_4">What will be their age difference?</p>
	<p class="block_4">About 1 year only, Sir.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When your grandfather can have children within an interval of one year how is it he had only two
		children.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As soon as my father was born the grandfather died.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">What a pity! Alright mention a number within 249.</p>

	<p class="block_4">Sub-lord of the 8th cusp is in Moon sub.. Moon is deposited in the constellation of Mars, Mars is
		the significator of 6 as it is the owner of the sixth house. So the person must give,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Since that person is your father's elder brother, then the 11th house counted from the 9th
		represents this uncle, Normally 7 house indicates those with whom you transact. This also agrees. For
		confirmation let us see the sub-lord of the 6th. It is Mars who is in the constellation of lord of 6 and in the
		sub of node in 11.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore he must give and you must receive, </p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334480" class="block_12">Shall I commit Suicide?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Hullo, this is a dangerous query. The astrologer can very well hand you over to such a department
		which will prevent you from commiting suicide. Are you a coward? Why can't you face the problems? Are you not a
		man? If you want to know whether you would commit suicide astrologically, the sub-lord of the 8th cusp must be
		deposited in the constellation of a planet who is the significator of Badhakasthana or Marakasthana and also 8th
		house. Further the lord of the constellation must have some connection or other with Mars.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334481" class="block_12">Will I commit Murder?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Note the sub-lord of your Ascendant. The lord of the sign, star and sub of the 7th cusp will be
		the ruling planets of the person whom you want to murder (One should note that one may go to murder one person
		but by mistake one may murder another). So it is important to note the ruling planet of the opponent. The sign
		where the 7th cusp has fallen is to be noted. Note whether this seventh sign is a movable one or fixed one or a
		common one. Judge the Bhadhakasthana, Marakasthana and find out the significators. If the sub-lord of your
		ascendant is deposited in the constellation of a planet which is the significator of his Bhadhakasthana or
		Marakasthana and also the significator of your second house then you will commit murder.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Readers should note that I carried out the experiment with a friend of mine who is the owner of a
		few sheep. Whenever he gave feast to his friends, he himself found pleasure in selecting a sheep and
		slaughtering it himself. On 3 occasions I asked him to give a number within 249 before killing the animal and
		the above rule came very true. Only once he gave me information that one more kid is added to his cattle. He
		gave the time of of birth. I noted down the ruling planets of that sheep. It is God who controls everything in
		which the number that the person gives is not excluded. When after 4 years he wanted to kill it I asked him to
		give a number and the 7th cusp in full agreed with the ruling planets at the moment of the birth of the sheep.

	<p class="block_4">These will appear to be funny.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">I carried out experiments with the cows I had to find out how far prenatal epoch works. I took my
		cows to the Veterinary hospital, had them inoculated-inoculation and ejection for cows is only once-noted the
		date of inoculation and the delivery of the calf. I found a lot of disagreement. Later I collected data from
		maternity hospital and found that the prenatal epoch is not reliable and helpful whereas it is useless in the
		cases of those born within a period of one hour. Thus I have done experiments which are rare but which open our
		eyes.</p>
