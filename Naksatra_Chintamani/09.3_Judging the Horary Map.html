mind of the querent is shown by the position of Moon and it helps in knowing
the nature of the question asked.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally Moon or its Star lord or its Sub
lord occupies or owns the house under query; or Moon is connected with the
house of query by conj. or association with, or by aspect from the owner or
occupant of that house or from the chief governor of the matter asked.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.3_Judging the Horary Map_2"><span lang="EN-US">Fulfilment of a Query</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Planet direct or retrograde. Ordinarily in
the horary map a planet in direct motion gives results, so a retrograde planet
can give results only when it gets direct in motion and when it crosses the
point from where it turned retrograde. However this is subject to modification
according to experience in individual cases. Further, the meaning of a
retrograde planet is to be interpreted according to the nature of a query in
each case.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord. 1. (a) The cuspal sub lord
of a house under query indicates whether the matter signified by that house is
promised or not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The matter is promised if the cuspal
sub lord is the significator (i. e. in the star of the occupant or owner) of
that house or any one of the houses under consideration.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) If the cuspal sub lord or its sub star
lord is retrograde; the matter is promised when they get direct in motion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) If the Star lord (of this Cuspal Sub
lord) is retrograde, the matter is not denied but it will not materialise
during the period, subperiod or inter period of this cuspal sub lord. However
it materialises during the period, subperiod or inter period of another
significator (of the matter under query) whose star lord is direct in motion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) As each house denotes several
particular matters, the chief governor of the matter under query may be taken
into account and it should be connected with the star lord of the cuspal sub
lord of the house under query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. In the horary map the Asc. indicates the
efforts of the querent; while the 11th cusp shows the fulfilment of desires or
success in general.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So if the cuspal sub lord of the Asc. or
the 11th cusp be the significator of the matter asked, the querent gets success
in general.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of the Asc. or the
11th cusp be the occupant of the house 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 or 11; or if it is in the
star of the occupant of the house 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 or 11 the querent gets
success, in all undertakings (The Asc. denotes success in one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s efforts; 2nd. monetary gain; 3rd. help from others; 6th. being 12
to 7 loss to the other and gain to the querent; 10th. reputation and 11th.
stands for profit. So these houses are beneficial to the querent in general).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Significators. 1. The significators show
the time of an event.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. So note the significators of the house
or houses which signify the matter asked.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Reject that significator which is in the
star of a retrograde planet (because it cannot during its period or sub period
etc., give the results of its star lord).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Out of these significators give
preference to those significators which are found among the following planets :</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Ruling Planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The sign lord, star lord and sub lord
of the cusp of the house under query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The cuspal sub lords of the houses
under consideration.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) The joint period rulers at the time of
judgment. Discretion should be used while selecting the significators from the
above planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. The query will materialise during the
joint period of these significators when the transit agrees.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Transit. At the time of event Sun, Moon
and/or the joint period rulers will be found in the star or sub of the same
joint period ruler or rulers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The rules for judgment given in the
previous chapters may be applied also in the horary map.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.2_Example.html">← Example</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.3_Judging the Horary Map">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.4_Longevity.html">Longevity →</a></div></body>
