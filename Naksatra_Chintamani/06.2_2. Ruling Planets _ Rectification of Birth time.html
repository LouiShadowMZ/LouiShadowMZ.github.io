judgment correspond or agree or tally with:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) the ruling planets at the birth; or</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(ii) the sign lord, star lord, sub lord and
sub sub lord of the Asc at the birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sign lord, star lord, sub lord, and sub
sub lord of the Asc at the birth are found either in the star or sub of the
ruling planet or planets at the time of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Example: Male, Birth 7</span>–<span lang="EN-US">7</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1912, Sunday; 8</span>–<span lang="EN-US">42

Ketu in
Virgo represents Mercury, so the ruling planets are Sun, Moon, Mercury,
Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment: 8</span>–<span lang="EN-US">9</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1969, Monday, 7</span>–<span lang="EN-US">45

So it
represents Saturn. Ketu was in Leo. So it represents Sun. Hence the ruling
planets are Sun, Moon, Mercury, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets at the birth tally with
the ruling planets at the time of judgment. Jupiter at the birth is in the star
of Saturn the ruling planet at the time of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Asc. at the birth is Capricorn 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 25', it is jointly ruled as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="51" src="img/image021.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sign lord, star lord and sub lord of
the Asc at the birth agree with the ruling planets at the time of judgment;
while the sub sub lord of the Asc at the birth is in the star of Saturn the
ruling planet at the time of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus in this case the ruling planets both
at the time of judgment and birth tally. The joint rulers of the Asc at the
birth also correspond to the ruling planets at the time of judgment. So the
birth time is correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. In doubtful cases where two times for
the birth are given proceed thus:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Note the sign lord, star lord, sub lord
and sub sub lord of the Asc at the birth for two given times.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The case in which the sign lord, star
lord, sub lord and sub sub lord of the Asc agree with the ruling planets at the
time of judgment, accept the time in that case as the correct time of birth and
reject the other.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Example: Male. Birth 15</span>–<span lang="EN-US">6</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1944, Thursday; 9</span>–<span lang="EN-US">0

Indian Standard time was made faster by one hour and it was called the New
Indian Standard time. The birth time was 9</span>–<span lang="EN-US">0 A.M., but
it was not certain whether it was recorded according to the new I.S.T. or the
old I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="121" src="img/image022.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of judgment. 31</span>–<span lang="EN-US">7</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1970, Friday; 10</span>–<span lang="EN-US">30

Jupiter, Venus and Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sign lord, star lord, sub lord and sub
sub lord of the Asc Gemini 28</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 7' for 9</span>–<span lang="EN-US">0 A.M. I.S.T. (New) agree with the ruling planets at the time of
judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So take 9</span>–<span lang="EN-US">0 A.M.
I.S.T. (New) as the correct time of birth and reject 9</span>–<span lang="EN-US">0
A.M. I.S.T. (Old).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. In cases where the approximate interval
of birth time viz. 2 AM to 3 A.M., 10 A.M. to 12 noon: 7 P.M. to 8 P.M.and so
on is given, proceed as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Note the ruling planets at the time of
judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) According to the date of birth, you
should fix the probable sign of the Asc in which birth could have taken place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally the sign owned by any one of the
ruling planets will be rising in the Asc; or the sign occupied by Rahu or Ketu
if it is a ruling planet, will be rising in the Asc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Then select the starlord and sub lord
etc., suitable to this sign from the ruling planets. Bear in mind the order of
preference among the ruling planets, also the importance of Rahu or Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Find out the sensitive degree of this
sign on which the sign lord, star lord, sub lord and sub sub lord operate
jointly. This degree will show the exact position of the Ascendant at the
birth. The time when this degree rises in the Asc. should be considered as the
correct time of birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) It should be remembered that each
planet governs three Nakshatras, Constellations, or Stars e. g. Venus governs
13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20' to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40' in Aries,
Leo and Sagittarius as its Stars. So the ruling planet of any particular moment
will operate as a star lord in three different signs. So it will be difficult
as to which sign should be selected for fixing the time of birth. Hence it is
necessary that the approximate time of birth should be ascertained as to
whether it is between the Sun rise and Noon or between Noon and the Sun set or
between the Sun set and Midnight or between Midnight and the Sun rise,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) At the time of judgment if any planet
is found in the ascending sign or if it is in opposition to the Asc, then this
planet plays an important role in fixing the time of birth. It should be given
importance as a ruling planet, especially if that planet be in conj. with or
aspected by any ruling planet. Of course, discretion has to be used in such
cases.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Example: Male. Birth 23</span>–<span lang="EN-US">11</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1911, Thursday; 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> N 46', 73</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> E 40'. It was said that the
ascending sign at the time of birth is Gemini and the approximate time is
between 7</span>–<span lang="EN-US">30 p.m. I.S.T. and 8</span>–<span lang="EN-US">30
p.m. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of judgment. 31</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1970, Saturday; 4</span>–<span lang="EN-US">15
p.m. I.S.T; 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N2', 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> E35'.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling planets at the time of judgment</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="77" src="img/image024.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At this time Rahu was in Aquarius. So it
represents Saturn. Hence Rahu may be preferred to Saturn. Thus the ruling
planets are Mercury, Rahu, Jupiter and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment the Asc is Gemini.
So it is certain beyond doubt that the ascending sign at the time of birth is
Gemini. Now we have only to fix the degrees and minutes in Gemini.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Out of the ruling planets Mercury has
already become the sign lord. So we have now to select the star lord, sub lord
and sub sub lord out of Rahu, Jupiter and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Gemini Mars, Rahu and Jupiter can become
the star lords. Mars is not the ruling planet. So it is to be rejected. Hence
the selection is to be made out of Rahu and Jupiter. Rahu or Ketu is to be
considered stronger than any planet. So take Rahu as the star lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then out of Jupiter and Venus we have to
select the sub lord. Jupiter is the star lord of Moon, while Venus is the sign
lord of Moon. So select Jupiter as the sub lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus automatically becomes the sub sub
lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now find out the degree and minute in
Gemini on which all these ruling planets viz. Mercury, Rahu, Jupiter and Venus
operate jointly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Gemini 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 32'
27" to 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 50' 14" is the area on which all
the ruling planets operate jointly viz. Mercury becomes the sign lord, Rahu the
star lord, Jupiter the sub lord and Venus the sub sub lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the date of birth, the time at which
this degree of Gemini rises on the Asc should be taken as the time of birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On 23</span>–<span lang="EN-US">11</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1911, Thursday; 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> N 46', 73</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> E 40' at 7</span>–<span lang="EN-US">57 p.m. I.S.T. Gemini 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 33' rises on the Asc. So this time should be taken as the correct
time of birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Re-verification: On 13</span>–<span lang="EN-US">7</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1970, Monday; at 5</span>–<span lang="EN-US">45 p.m. I.S.T., 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> N 2', 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> E 35' there was a keen desire to re-verify the above time. Ruling
planets at that time were as under.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="81" src="img/image025.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus the ruling planets are Moon, Jupiter,
Venus, Rahu and Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The star lord Rahu, the sub lord Jupiter
and the sub sub lord Venus of the Asc Gemini 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 33' at
the time of birth correspond to the ruling planets at the time of
re-verification. Hence 7</span>–<span lang="EN-US">57 p.m. I.S.T. the time of
birth which is fixed is correct beyond doubt.</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.2_2.
