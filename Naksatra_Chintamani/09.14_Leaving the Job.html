the significator of 1, 5 or 9, the querent can leave service during the joint
period of the significators of 1, 5 and 9. These significators are generally
connected with the houses of service 2, 6 or 10.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.14_Leaving the Job_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent desires to leave service
because he does not keep good health. In this horary map Moon occupies the 9th
and owns the 10th. It is in the star Jupiter owning 3, 6 and occupying 3. It is
in the sub Saturn owning 5. So it is the significator of 3 (change), 6
(service) and connected with 5 (absence of service), 9 (absence of occupation)
and 10 (occupation). Thus Moon clearly indicates that the query refers to
leaving of service or occupation. Further Moon is aspected by Jupiter the owner
of 6. So it indicates ill health.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.14_Leaving the Job_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10th Cusp. The sub lord of the 10th cusp is
Mercury. It is direct in motion. It occupies 5. Its star lord Saturn is direct
in motion, it owns 5. Its sub lord Moon occupies 9. So Mercury is the
significator of 5 and connected with 5 and 9. Hence it signifies leaving of
service.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6th Cusp. The sub lord of the 6th cusp is
Ketu. It occupies 9. Its star lord Saturn is direct in motion, it owns 5. It is
in its own sub. So Ketu is the significator of 5 and connected with 9. Hence it
denotes leaving of service.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th Cusp. The sub lord of the 11th cusp is
Rahu. Its star lord Sun owns 11 and occupies 6. Its sub lord Ketu occupies 9.
So Rahu is the significator of 6, 11 and connected with 9. Hence the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s desire to leave service on account of ill health will be
fulfilled.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.14_Leaving the Job_4"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="95" src="img/image101.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">None of them is in the star or sub of a

and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter owns 6, it is in the star and sub
Venus owning 1 which is in conj. with Saturn owning 5. So it is the
significator of 1, 5 and connected with 1, 5 and 6.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn is in the star Moon owning 10 and
occupying 9; it is in the sub Mars owning 2 in conj. with Saturn owning 5 and
Venus owning 1. So it is the significator of 9, 10 and connected with 1, 2 and
5.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is in the star Moon owning 10 and
occupying 9; it is in its own sub Venus owning 1 in conj. with Mars owning 2

planets and Saturn being in conj. with the ruling planet (Venus) is connected
