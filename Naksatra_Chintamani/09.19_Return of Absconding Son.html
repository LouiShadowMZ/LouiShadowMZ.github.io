he return?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 91 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35</span>′</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment 21-10-1972, Saturday; 9-50
A.M. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="500" src="img/image112.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="125" src="img/image113.jpg" width="553"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.19_Return of Absconding Son_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Consider the houses 3, 9 and 12 for the
missing person counting from his Asc. and the houses 2, 8 and 11 (being 12 to
3, 9 and 12) for returning homewards.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sublord of 12 be the
significator of 3, 9 or 12 a person runs away during the joint period of the
significators of 3, 9 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sublord of 11 be the
significator of 2, 8 or 11 a person returns home during the joint period of the
significators of 2, 8 and 11.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.19_Return of Absconding Son_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map the father asked the
query about his son. So consider the 5th cusp as the Asc. of the son and
proceed. For convenience the roman letter is given to each house counted from
the 5th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is in the star Saturn owning II and
III; it is in the sub Jupiter owning and occupying the cusp of the son's Asc.
So Moon is the significator of II (return of the son), III (running away of the
son) and connected with the son's Asc. Hence Moon clearly shows that the query
is regarding the return of the son who ran away from home.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.19_Return of Absconding Son_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp XI</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is jointly ruled by Venus (sign lord),
Rahu (star lord) and Rahu (sub lord).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is in its own star Venus owning XI
and occupying IX; it is in the sub Mercury owning VII and occupying XI. So
Venus is the significator of XI (reunion), IX (long tour) and connected with
VII (breaking journey) and XI (reunion). This means that the son must come from
long tour by breaking journey towards home for reunion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is in the star Sun on XI cusp and in
the sub Moon owning VIII. So Rahu is the significator of XI and connected with
VIII. This promises the return of the son for reunion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Son's Asc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is jointly operated by Jupiter (sign
lord), Ketu (star lord) and Saturn (sub lord). The sign lord of the son's Asc.
Jupiter is in the star Ketu in VII (being in Gemini represents Mercury in XI);
it is in the sub Saturn owning II. So Jupiter is the significator of VII, XI
and connected with II. Hence the son is on his way to home by breaking journey.
Jupiter's sub lord Saturn being retrograde the son cannot run away but return
homewards.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The star lord of the son's Asc. Ketu
occupies VII; it is in the star Jupiter owning and occupying the Asc. I; it is
in the sub Venus owning XI and occupying IX. So Ketu is the significator of I
and connected with IX, XI and VII. Hence the son is on his way to home from
long tour by breaking journey.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub lord of the son's Asc. Saturn owns
II; it is in the star Mars owning XII; it is in the sub Jupiter owning and
occupying the Asc. I. So it is the significator of XII and connected with I.
This means that the son had run away from home at the time of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As Saturn is retrograde the son cannot
abscond any further, but he must turn back.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.19_Return of Absconding Son_4"><span lang="EN-US">Cusps II and VIII</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub lord of both these cusps is also
Venus which is the significator of XI as previously discussed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus XI cusp, the son's Asc., II and VIII
cusps all promise return of the son for reunion.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.19_Return of Absconding Son_5"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Saturn Dasha
balance 2Y 0M 24D) the querent's son is running the joint period of Saturn,
Jupiter, Saturn and Ketu which expires on 27-10-1972.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These joint period rulers are the
significators of II and XI and they are the cuspal joint rulers of the son's
Asc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn the sub lord of the son's Asc. and
the inter period ruler is retrograde. So the son is returning homewards from
long tour as indicated by Ketu the sookshma period ruler as previously
discussed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">After Ketu the sookshma period of Venus
follows from 27-10-1972 and lasts upto 21-11-1972. Venus is the strong
significator of XI as already mentioned in the earlier paragraphs. Moreover, it
is the star lord of XI cusp and the sub lord of II and VIII. So the querent's
son must return home during the joint period of Saturn, Jupiter, Saturn and
Venus.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.19_Return of Absconding Son_6"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was learnt from the querent that his son
returned home on 2-11-1972 Thursday at 11-45 A.M. I.S.T.. At this time Sun was transiting
in Libra 16</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 33</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the sub
Venus (the sookshma period ruler); Moon in Virgo 4</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 28</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the sub Saturn (the period and inter period ruler); and Venus in
Virgo 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 9</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in its own sub
Venus.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.18_Foreign Travel.html">← Foreign Travel</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.19_Return of Absconding Son">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.20_Lost Documents.html">Lost Documents →</a></div></body>
