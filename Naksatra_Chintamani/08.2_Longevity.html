I.S.T; 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 51</span>′<span lang="EN-US">; 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 10</span>′<span lang="EN-US">; Ayanamsa 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">23</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="478" src="img/image043.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_08.2_Longevity_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal Sub lord of the Asc. be the
significator of the badhaka and maraka houses, there is danger to the life
during the joint period of the significators of the badhaka and maraka houses.
If these significators be the cuspal joint rulers of the Asc. or the 8th cusp,
their joint period is very critical.  </span></p><h3 id="heading_08.2_Longevity_2"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Asc. (a) The cuspal sub lord of the Asc. is
Ketu. It is in the star Rahu (which is the significator of the badhaka house 7
and the owning 7. So Ketu is the significator of the badhaka and maraka
houses.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) We may also examine the strength of
Ketu's star lord Rahu and its sub lord Jupiter. Rahu is the significator of the
badhaka and maraka house. Jupiter owning 7 is in the star Sun owning and
occupying 12, and in the sub Venus owning 2; so it is also the significator of
the maraka house 12 and connected with the maraka house 2 and the badhaka house
7. Thus both Rahu and Jupiter are evil. Consequently, the cuspal sub lord of
the Asc. Ketu becomes evil and it denotes short life.  </span></p><h3 id="heading_08.2_Longevity_3"><span lang="EN-US">8th Cusp and Joint Period Rulers</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. In this birth map the 8th cusp is
jointly ruled by Mars (sign lord), Venus (star lord) and Rahu (sub lord). 
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From the very birth this child is running
the joint period of Mars (the cuspal sign lord of 8) and Rahu (the cuspal sub
lord of 8); and the joint period of Mars, Rahu and Venus (the cuspal star lord
of 8) will be current from 20-11-1973 upto 23-1-1974. So there is danger to its
life if they are the significators of the badhaka and maraka houses.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2 (a) The cuspal sign lord of 8 Mars
occupies 7. It is in the star Venus owning 2. It is in the sub Sun owning and
occupying 12. So Mars is the significator of the maraka house 2 and connected
with the badhaka house 7 and the maraka house 12.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The cuspal star lord of 8 Venus owns 2.
It is in the star Rahu (being in Sagittarius represents Jupiter owning 7 and
being aspected represents Saturn which aspects 7 and 12 and owns 6). It is in
the sub Mercury in 12. So Venus is the significator of 7 the badhaka house and
the maraka house 12 and connected with 12 and 2 the maraka houses.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The cuspal sub lord of 8 Rahu is in the
star Ketu (being in Gemini represents Mercury in 12 and being in conj.
represents Saturn which aspects 7 and 12 and owns 6). It is in the sub Saturn.
So Rahu is the significator of the badhaka house 7 and the maraka house 12 and
connected with the same houses.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) Thus the cuspal joint rulers of the 8th
house are the significators of the badhaka and maraka houses and they are the
joint period rulers current from 20-11-1973 to 23-1-1974. So this time is very
critical for its life; because the cuspal sub lord of the Asc. denotes short
life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Further all these three joint period
rulers are inter related. The period ruler Mars is in the star of and aspect
with the inter period ruler Venus. The inter period ruler Venus is in the star
of the sub period ruler Rahu. The sub period ruler Rahu is in the star of the
cuspal sub lord of the Asc. Ketu. This is the strongest testimony which points
out that the child will not at all survive this joint period of Mars, Rahu and
Venus.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.2_Longevity_4"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This child died on 10-12-1973 at 7-0 p.m.

the transit agrees with the joint period rulers.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.1_Good or Bad Sub Period.html">← IV Example Nativities</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.2_Longevity">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.3_Eye Sight.html">Eye Sight →</a></div></body>
