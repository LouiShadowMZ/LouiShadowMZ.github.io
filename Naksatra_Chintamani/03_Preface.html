<h1 id="heading_03_Preface_0"><span lang="EN-US">Preface</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There is ample literature published on
Hindu Astrology depicting various systems of prediction by learned Astrologers.
But every student of Astrology has his own likes and dislikes, he therefore
follows the predictive system of his choice. Each system of prediction has its
own peculiarity and merits too. So far as I am concerned, I liked the sub
disposition theory of prediction in the Nakshatra dispositor system of
Astrology. Accordingly I have selected some typical birth horoscopes and
example horary maps on different important topics of life as experienced and
observed by me and I have in this book made an humble attempt to discuss these
horoscopes on the practical application of this sub disposition theory of
prediction, for the knowledge of the reader who desires to know about it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. This book is meant for the reader who is
conversant with the basic principles of Hindu Astrology. It is expected that
the reader should know how to make use of Raphael's Tables of Houses and
Ephemerides. He should possess the knowledge of Casting the Horoscope. He
should know about the Characteristics of Signs, Planets, Houses, Planets in
Signs, Planets in Houses, General Principles of Judgment, Judgment of the 12
Houses, Calculation of Vinshottari Dasha (period) rulers Sub period rulers,
Inter period rulers and Sookshma period rulers and their judgment (Hindu
Predictive Astrology by Pandit GopeshKumar Ojha, 93, Daryaganj, Delhi 6. and A
Students' Text Book of Astrology by Vivian E. Robson are worth reading for the
basic knowledge of Astrology).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3 (a) The original Hindu method is what is
known as the equal house division. The sign ascending is the first house and
any planet therein is said to be in the first house. The sign next to the
ascending sign will constitute the second house and any planet therein will be
said to be in the 2nd house and so on. This is the principle followed by the
old Hindu Astrologers. Thus the sign and the house were deemed synonymous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) In Western Astrology the cusp of a
house is the commencing point and the first house is constituted by space
covering about 30</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> beyond the cusp; but in Hindu
Astrology the cusp is the mid point or the centre of the house and extends to
15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> on either side.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) In this book first of all you have to
erect a horoscope according to the Western (Sayana) system with the aid of
Raphael's Tables of Houses and Ephemeris. Then you have to deduct ayanamsa for
the required year from Sayana positions of the cusps and planets; and you will
get Nirayana positions of the cusps and planets. You should write the cusps and
planets in the manner of a Western Horoscope. For the purposes of this book the
cusp of a house is to be considered as the commencing point.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further it may be remembered that the
question of ayanamsa is a controversial subject, but for the subject matter of
this book ayanamsa adopted for each A. D. year is given on page 168.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) In the Western system it is usual to
write down signs and degrees on the cusps of the houses in a circular blank map
and to place the planets in the map in their correct positions. For the
purposes of this book and for the sake of convenience I have made a device to
write the horoscope in the form of a ladder by drawing one verticle line in the
middle and five horizontal lines intersecting the verticle line. The ends of
the verticle line and the ends of the horizontal lines will serve as the cusps
of houses and the signs have been written thereon and the planets have been
writen either below or above the cuspal sign as the case may be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. The Zodiac of 360</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> is divided into 27 Nakshatras or Constellations or Stars for the
purpose of Astrology. Each Nakshatra contains 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>′<span lang="EN-US">. It begins from 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> Aries. It is subdivided
into 9 parts totalling 243 and each sub division is known as Sub Nakshatra or
Sub Constellation or Sub Star or Sub. So each degree and minute of the Zodiac
is jointly ruled by three planets out of which one becomes the sign lord, the
other is the star lord and the third is the sub lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sum and substance of the sub
disposition theory of prediction is that the cuspal sub lord of a house
indicates whether the matter signified by the house is promised or denied. If
the cuspal sub lord promises, then only during the joint period of the significators
of that matter the results of that matter are experienced; otherwise not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The significator planet always gives the
results of the house occupied and owned by its star lord during the
significator planet's period, sub period and inter period. If the sub lord of
the significator planet is harmonious to the matters indicated by the star
lord, the significator planet gives favourable results. This system equally
applies both to the birth horoscopes and horary maps. The details are
illustratively explained in the book.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Whatever is essential to know prior to
the practical application of the principles has been explained by way of
illustrations. Each topic has been methodically presented in nut shell,
according to my view point and observation in several cases. It is in the
manner I wish the reader to understand the subject matter. So it needs little
mention that the presentation, expression and interpretation may vary with
personal equation. Conclusions drawn are logical and natural. They are neither
abrupt nor twisted. There is no sham show of predicting an event correct to the
date.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. In my humble opinion, the science of
Astrology is best learnt by experience and observation. The more you observe
the more is the scope for modification. The main object of this book is to make
this system of prediction easily accessible to every student of Astrology who
only possesses workable knowledge of the English language. So the language used
is simple and lucid. This book is only illustrative and not exhaustive. Lovers
of Astrology in different regions of the country may publish this book in their
own regional language for the benefit of the student world of Astrology if they
so desire; and they would be rendering services in the cause of the wide spread
of this Nakshatra system of Astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. My friend Shri S. M. Patel made me
switch over to this Nakshatra system of Astrology. He constantly inspired me to
write this book in English. He moved the board of Trustees of Shri Vivek
Education Trust to bring out this publication and to give me patronage. I
therefore owe a deep debt of gratitude to them all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I hope all my readers will enjoy this text
book.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">28-3-1975</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">64, Jayanagar Society</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ahmedabad-22.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Chandrakant Ratteshwar Bhatt</span></p>
