sub lord of the 2nd be the significator of 2, 6, 10 or 11, the native will have
an independent earning during the joint period of the significators of 2, 6, 10
and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2 (a) In this map the sub lord of the 2nd
cusp is Sun. As seen from the above table it is the significator of 5 (betting,
gambling, risky enterprise), 10 (ambitions, business activities) and connected
with 2 (self-earning), 4 (land, factory, possessions), 6 (loans, debts, gain
from others), 9 (changes in business activities i.e. more than one business),
11 (friends, supporters, gain, success) and 3 (self-abilities). Hence the
native will earn in so many ways as mentioned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) As the cuspal sub lord of 2 (Sun) is
the significator of 2, 6, 10 and 11, he will earn money during the period of
Sun from 17-3-1960 to 17-3-1966.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The 2nd cusp is jointly ruled by Sun,
Venus and Sun. As seen from the above table Venus is also the significator of 2
and 11. So during the joint period of Sun and Venus from 17-3-1965 to
17-3-1966, he will earn much.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7th Cusp (business). 1. If the cuspal sub
lord of the 7th be the significator of 2, 10 or 11, the native will gain in
business during the joint period of the significators of 2, 10 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2 (a) In this map the sub lord of the 7th
cusp is Venus. As seen from the above table it is the significator of 2
(self-earning), 4 (land, factory, possessions), 11 (gain) and connected with 1
(self) and 9 (changes in business activities i.e. more than one business). So
the native will do many types of business</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The cuspal sub lord of 7 Venus is the
significator of 2 and 11; it is also the star lord of the 2nd cusp. So he will
gain in business during the joint period of Sun and Venus (17-3-1965 to
17-3-1966).</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.10_Partnership Business_2"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In view of this the native started an
independent business during the period of Sun the significator of 2, 6, 10 and
11 (17-3-1960 to 17-3-1966) and he earned much during this time. In the sub
period of Venus the significator of 2 and 11 (17-3-1965 to 17-3-1966) his
earning was substantial and to his satisfaction.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.10_Partnership Business_3"><span lang="EN-US">2. Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7th Cusp (partnership business). 1. If the
cuspal sub lord of the 7th be the significator of 8 or 12, the native will lose
in business during the joint period of the significators of 8 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. In this map the cuspal sub lord of 7
(Venus) is no doubt the significator of 2 and 11. But its star lord (Venus) and
sub lord (Moon) are aspected by the owner of 8 (misfortune) and the natural
malefic Saturn which owns and occupies 7 (partnership business). Moreover, the
sub lord Moon is also aspected by the owner of 12 (loss) Mercury. Thus the
cuspal sub lord of 7 Venus is connected with 7, 8 and 12 and it denotes loss in
the partnership business. So the native will lose in the partnership business during
the joint period of the significators of 8 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th cusp (out come). The sub lord of the
11th cusp is Ketu. As seen from the above table it is the significator of 6
(debts, separation of the partner) and connected with 12 (loss, native
separating from the partnership, liabilities). So the cuspal sub lord of 11
denotes loss and separation of the partners. This will happen during the joint
period of the significators of 6, 8 and 12.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.10_Partnership Business_4"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 7th cusp is jointly ruled by Saturn,
Moon and Venus; while the 11th cusp is jointly governed by Venus, Moon and
Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As seen from the above table and as already
discussed in the previous paras Moon, Venus, Saturn and Ketu are connected with
6, 7, 8 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Saturn is the significator of 6 and
connected with 7 and 8. Moon is the significator of 12; its sub lord Mars is
aspected by Saturn, so Mars is connected with 7 and 8; consequently Moon is
said to be connected with 7 and 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The next after Sun the period of Moon
starts from 17-3-1966 and the sub period of Saturn commences (earlier than
Venus) from 17-6-1970. In the sub period of Saturn the inter period of Ketu
begins (earlier than Venus) from 8-12-1970. All these three planets are the
significators of and connected with 6, 7, 8 and 12. So during the joint period
of Moon, Saturn and Ketu (8-12-1970 to 11-1-1971) both the partnership and the
partnership business will come to an end due to loss, heavy debts and increased
liabilities when the transit agrees.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.10_Partnership Business_5"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The native closed the partnership business
