I. S. T. (New); 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N43</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 74</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> E 39</span>′<span lang="EN-US">; Ayanamsa 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US">

(a) The Asc. is jointly ruled by Moon,
Saturn and Sun. Moon is the significator of 6 (sickness or disease</span>–<span lang="EN-US">being in the Star Ketu in 6 which also represents Jupiter owing 6).
The starlord of the Asc. is Saturn which owns 8. It denotes long life. The
sublord of the Asc. is Sun which owns 2. Hence life is long.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The mental trend of the native is shown
by the cuspal sublord of the Asc. which is Sun. Sun occupies 8 (suicide), it is
in conj. with Mercury the chief governor of reason and the owner of 12 (self</span>–<span lang="EN-US">undoing) and aspected by Moon the owner of the Asc. (self) and the
chief governor of mind. This denotes self undoing nature and suicidal
mentality.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Sun the sub lord of the Asc. is in the
star Rahu in 12 (representing Saturn owning 8 on the cusp of 12) and in the sub
Ketu (representing the aspecting Saturn). Thus the sub lord of the Asc. is the
significator of 8 and 12. So it denotes an accident.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8th Cusp. The sub lord of the 8th cusp is
Moon. It owns the Asc. (self), it is in Leo (fiery sign), it is aspected by
Mars (accident by burning or fire). Its star lord Ketu is in Sagittarius (fiery
sign), it represents Saturn owning 8 on the 12th Cusp, Ketu denotes an accident
by burning. Thus the sub lord of the 8th cusp is connected with 8 and 12; fiery
sign and an accident by burning.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.4_Attempt to Commit Suicide_2"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of Accident</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. In this case the cuspal sub lord of the
Asc. denotes suicidal mentality and an accident; while the cuspal sub lord of
the 8th shows an accident by burning.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. An accident generally happens during the
joint period of the significators of 8 and 12. If the cuspal sub lord of the
Asc, 8 or 12; or if the cuspal joint rulers of any of these houses be the
significators of 8 and 12, the accident occurs during their joint period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In cases of sickness, disease, serious
injuries or accident the joint period ruler or rulers form an evil aspect by
Square or opposition to the Asc; or forms sextile or trine to the 6th, 8th or
12th cusp; or to the owner of 6, 8 or 12; or to the planet in 6, 8 or 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. In this case Sun and Mercury are in the
star Rahu in 12 (representing Saturn owning 8). They are the significators of 8
and 12. Mars is in the sub Saturn owning 8 and on the cusp of the 12th, so it
is also the significator of 8 and 12. (Mars is in the star Moon which is
aspected by the significators of 8 and 12 i.e. Sun, Mercury and Saturn, hence
Mars is the strongest significator of 8 and 12).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun and Mercury are in trine both to the
12th cusp and Saturn owning 8. Mars is in opposition to the Asc.. Sun, Mercury
and Mars are aspecting the owner of the Asc. and the cuspal sub lord of 8
(Moon).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Hence an accident will occur during the
joint period of Sun, Mercury and Mars.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.4_Attempt to Commit Suicide_3"><span lang="EN-US">Joint period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This native was born during the period of
Ketu with balance of 2Y 8M 17D. The joint period of Sun and Mercury will start
from 1-9-1971.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this case the native attempted to commit
suicide. So the accident occurred during the joint period of Sun, Mercury and
Sun (Sun is the sub lord of the Asc. and it denotes the native herself and her
own initiation) which commenced from 23-12-1971. As she burnt herself the
accident happened in the Sookshma period of Mars (the star lord of the 8th
cusp) which commenced on 25-12-1971. Hence she attempted to commit suicide by
pouring kerosene over her body and she suffered severe burns during the joint
period of Sun, Mercury, Sun and Mars on 25-12-1971 Saturday at 9-15 p.m. I.S.T.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.4_Attempt to Commit Suicide_4"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At that time Sun was transitting in
Sagittarius 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 51</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> the fiery
sign through the 6th house; Moon in Pisces 17</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 42</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the star Mercury (the sub period ruler); Mercury in Scorpio 19</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 12</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in its own star. Thus the transit
agreed with the joint period ruler at the time of the event.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.4_Attempt to Commit Suicide_5"><span lang="EN-US">Recovery</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this case Ketu is the sub lord of the
period</span>–<span lang="EN-US">inter period ruler Sun, it represents Jupiter
(being in Sagittarius) which aspects the 11th cusp (recovery), it also
represents Venus (its star lord) the owner of 11. The sookshma period ruler
Mars owns 5 (recovery), it is in trine to the 11th cusp and sextile to the 5th
cusp. So the native could recover from serious injuries and her life was saved,
because the Asc. promises long life as already discussed,</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.3_Eye Sight.html">← Eye Sight</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.4_Attempt to Commit Suicide">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.5_Education.html">Education →</a></div></body>
