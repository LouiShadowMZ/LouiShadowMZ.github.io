<body><h2 id="heading_05.14_14. Joint Period Rulers_0"><span lang="EN-US">14. Joint Period Rulers</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. The period or sub period ruler gives the
results according to its natural rulership over certain affairs of life e.g.
Venus is the chief governor of peace or harmony, marriage, vehicle or happiness
etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. It gives favourable or unfavourable
results of its star lord according as its sub lord is favourable or
unfavourable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. The period ruler, the sub period ruler
or the inter period ruler each may signify matters of different houses i.e.
different subject matters both desirable and undesirable. So during their joint
period they will give the results of the common subject matter either desirable
or undesirable as the case may be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose the period ruler is the
significator of 2, 5 or 11 and 1, 4 or 10 (child birth and also its denial),
then during the sub period of the significator of 1, 4 or 10 there will be no
child birth and if there be any child already, separation from the child is
likely; and during the sub period of the significator of 2, 5 or 11 the birth
of a child will take place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. If the star lord (of the period ruler
etc) occupies 6, 8 or 12 as counted from its own sign (house), then the period
or sub period ruler will not give favourable results of this house (owned by
its star lord).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. If the planet and its star lord are in
6, 8 or 12 sign from each other, the native will not get results to a desired
extent during their joint period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1. the
planets (Sun and Venus) and their star lord (Jupiter) are in the 8th and 6th
sign from each other. So during the joint period of Venus and Jupiter
(13-2-1940 to 13-10-1942) and during the joint period of Sun and Jupiter
(1-1-1952 to 19-10-1952) the native got only an ordinary temporary rise in
service and not a good rise to a desired extent.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. If the star lord of the period or sub
period ruler be retrograde, the native will experience ups and downs in
general.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1, Sun
and Venus are in the star Jupiter in the 10th, so the native was gradually
promoted to higher posts carrying position and powers. But the star lord
Jupiter is retrograde, so reversions and promotions continued till he retired
from service.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. The joint period rulers generally give
the results of the house or houses owned by their star lords, so their strength
will depend on the strength of their star lords.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. If the joint period rulers are in
reception (in each other's sign), in conj. or aspect with each other, they
influence the affairs of each other. This is based on the principle that a
planet in conj. with or aspected by a significator gives the results of the
house or houses denoted by that significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1, the
period ruler Mars is the significator of printing and publication of books on
astrology (Mars is in the star Ketu on the cusp of 9 and in the sub Venus
owning 10. Ketu in 9 denotes astrology, it being in Virgo represents Mercury
which shows writings, it also represents its star lord Mars which indicates
printing. Venus being in the star Jupiter owning 3 in 10 is the significator of
publications). The sub period ruler Rahu is aspected by Mars. So Rahu will give
the results indicated by Mars. In view of this, during the joint period of Mars
and Rahu the native's book on astrology was printed and published in the year
1966</span>–<span lang="EN-US">67.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The activity of writing books on astrology
and their publications was continued throughout the period of Mars and it was
also being continued during the period of Rahu which commenced on 13-12-1972.
During the joint period of Rahu, Rahu and Ketu, the printing of this book was
started from 3-9-1974. Ketu being in the star Mars and in the sub Rahu is also
the significator of printing and publication.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is in the star Mercury owning 9 and in
its own sub. The star lord Mercury is aspected by Jupiter owning 3 and the sub
lord Rahu is aspected both by Mars and Jupiter.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.13_13. Cuspal sublord and its Subject matter.html">← 13.
