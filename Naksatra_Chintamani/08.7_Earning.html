<body><h2 id="heading_08.7_Earning_0"><span lang="EN-US">Earning</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Female. Birth 17-5-1952 Saturday; 7-39 p.m.
I.S.T; 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N2', 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35';

The sub lord of the
6th and the 10th cusps is Venus. It is in its own star Venus in 6 and in the
sub Saturn in 10. So Venus is the significator of 6 (service or money from
others) and connected with 10 (occupation). Hence the sub lord of the 6th and
the 10th cusps promises earning to the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2nd cusp. The sub lord of the 2nd cusp is
Jupiter. It is in the star Ketu (being in Leo represents Sun in 6 owning 10)
and in the sub Saturn in 10. So Jupiter is the significator of 6, 10 and
connected with 10. Hence the sub lord of the 2nd cusp promises earning to the
native.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.7_Earning_2"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of 2_ 6 10 and 11.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="163" src="img/image049.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter, Sun, Venus, Saturn and Rahu are
the significators of money or service. Among them Sun and Venus are in the sub
Saturn in 10; Rahu is in the sub Venus in 6. So Sun, Venus and Rahu are strong
significators; among them Rahu is stronger than Venus.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.7_Earning_3"><span lang="EN-US">Joint period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This native was born during the period of
Rahu with balance of 5Y 0M 23D. The period of Jupiter will start from 10-6-1957
and will continue upto 10-6-1973.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter is the cuspal sub lord of 2 and it
is the significator of 2, 6 and 10 as discussed above, So the native will be
able to earn during its period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is among the significators of money,
so it should be given preference over other significators. Hence Rahu should be
selected as the sub period ruler.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is among the strong significators and
it is the cuspal sub lord of 6 and 10. So it should be selected as the inter
period ruler.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus during the joint period of Jupiter,
Rahu and Venus (30-7-1972 to 24-12-1972) the native will get service and will
begin to earn.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.7_Earning_4"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The native got her first employment on
12-10-1972, when Sun was transitting in Virgo 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 24'
in the sub Rahu (the sub period ruler); Moon in Scorpio 19</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20' in the sub Venus (the inter period ruler); Jupiter in
Sagittarius 8</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 29' in its own sub Jupiter (the period
ruler); Rahu in Sagittarius the sign owned by Jupiter; Venus in Leo 14</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 18' in the star and sub of Venus itself. Thus the transit agrees
with the joint period rulers.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.6_Scholarship.html">← Scholarship</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.7_Earning">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.8_Transfer in Service.html">Transfer in Service →</a></div></body>
