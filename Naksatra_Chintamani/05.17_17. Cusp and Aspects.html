1, the Asc is in opposition (180</span>°<span lang="EN-US">) aspect to Mercury
the owner of 6. So the planet in the star of Mercury will cause sickness to the
native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Both Moon and Rahu are in the star of
Mercury. So during the sub periods of Moon and Rahu the health of the native
was much disturbed every now and then.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The Asc is in trine (120</span>°<span lang="EN-US">) aspect to Saturn and in sextile (60</span>°<span lang="EN-US">)
aspect to Jupiter. So the planets in the star of Saturn and Jupiter will
protect the health of the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Both Mercury and Jupiter are in the star of
Saturn: while both Sun and Venus are in the star of Jupiter. So during the sub
periods of Jupiter, Mercury, Venus and Sun the native could maintain his
health.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mc. The Mc (10th cusp) is in trine aspect
to both Venus and Sun. So the planet in the star of Venus and Sun will be
favourable to the native in maintaining his position in service. There is no
planet in the star of Venus, but Saturn is in the star of Sun. Hence during the
sub periods of Saturn and Venus the native could maintain his position in
service.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.16_16. Cuspal Matter and Joint Period Rulers.html">← 16.
