Significator and its sub lord_1"><span lang="EN-US">Significance of the significator and the sub</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. The significator shows the source of an
event. The matters especially of the house or houses owned by it serve as the
source</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. The significator gives the results of
its star lord. So the star lord becomes the indicator of the matters of the
house occupied and owned by it and also of the house aspected by it</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. (a) The sub lord of the significator is
the deciding factor regarding the matters of the star lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) If the sub lord is harmonious to the
matters indicated by the star lord, the significator gives favourable results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) If the sub lord is detrimental to the
matters indicated by the star lord, the significator gives unfavourable
results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. The significator gives during its
period, sub period or inter period the results of its star lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Or, the results of the star lord are
experienced during the joint period (i.e. during the period, sub period and
inter period) of the significator, its star lord and its sub lord,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. In short, the significator denotes the
time when it will give the results of its star lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub lord of the significator shows
whether these results will be favourable or unfavourable.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.10_10. Significator and its sub lord_2"><span lang="EN-US">Example birth horoscope no. 1</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Education. The houses 4, 9 and 11 are for
education or studies; while 3 and 8 for completion or negation or denial of
studies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Moon is the significator of 9 (in the
Star Mercury owning 9). Its Sub lord Sun is the owner of 8 (12th from 9), so it
is detrimental to the matters of 4, 9 and 11. Hence the significator Moon
cannot give favourable results regarding studies. Thus the native after passing
his B.A. examination in the year 1934</span>–<span lang="EN-US">35 during the
joint period of Venus and Moon, gave up his studies</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Rahu is the significator of 9 (in the
Star Mercury owning 9). Its sub lord is also Rahu which is harmonious to the
matters of 4, 9 and 11, Hence the significator Rahu will give favourable
results regarding studies. Thus the native prosecuted his further studies in
Law in the year 1939 during the period of Venus in the sub period of Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) In short if the sub lord is the owner
or occupant of 3 or 8; or is in the star of the occupant or owner of 3 or 8; or
is in conj. or in aspect with the significator of 3 or 8, it is said to be
detrimental to the matters of 4, 9 or 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord is the occupant or owner of
4, 9 or 11; or is in the star of the occupant or owner of 4, 9 and 11; or is in
conj. or in aspect with the significator of 4, 9 or 11, it is said to be
harmonious to the matters of 4, 9 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In other words, if the sub lord is the
significator of 4, 9 or 11 it is said to be harmonious to and connected with
the matters of 4, 9 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord is the significator of 3 or
8 it is detrimental to the matters of 4, 9 and 11 and it is said to be
connected with 3 and 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Marriage. The houses 2, 7 and 11 are for
marriage; while 1, 6 and 10 for denial of marriage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Moon is the significator of 7 (in the
Star Mercury in 7). Its sub lord Sun occupies 6 (12th from 7), so it is
detrimental to the matters of 2, 7 and 11. Hence the significator Moon cannot
give favourable results regarding marriage. Thus the native could not marry
during the joint period of Venus and Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Rahu is the significator of 7 (in the
Star Mercury in 7). Its sub lord is also Rahu which is harmonious to the
matters of 2, 7 and 11. Hence the significator Rahu will give favourable
results regarding marriage. Thus the native could marry in the year 1937 during
the period of Venus in the sub period of Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) In short if the sub lord is the
significator of 1, 6 or 10 it is detrimental to the matters of 2, 7 and 11 and
it is said to be connected with 1, 6 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord is the significator of 2, 7
or 11 it is said to be harmonious to and connected with the matters of 2, 7 and
11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Government loan. The houses 2, 6 and 11 are
for gain of money in any manner; while 8 and 12 for repayment of money or loss
of money in any manner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon owns 7 (Govt. or Co-operative
Society). It is the significator of 6 (receipt of loan) and 7 (money lender),
because it is in the star Mercury owning 6 and occupying 7. The star lord
Mercury is aspected by Saturn owning 2 (money) and Jupiter owning 12
(investment or repayment of money). So Mercury is connected with 2 and 12.
Hence Moon signifies the matters of 2, 6, 7 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Its sub lord Sun owns 8 (repayment of loan)
and occupies 6 (receipt of loan). So Sun is harmonious to the matters of 2, 6,
7 and 12 as indicated by the star lord Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the significator Moon shows Govt. or
Co-operative Society as the source of an event and it will give during its
period favourable results of the star lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus during the period of Moon in the year
1958</span>–<span lang="EN-US">59 the native could receive loan from Govt.
through the Co-operative Society for constructing a building on the plot of the
Society subject to its repayment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Retirement from Service : The houses 1, 5,
9 and 12 are for retirement from service. The native retired from service on 8</span>–<span lang="EN-US">6</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1970 during the joint period of Mars,
Mercury and Saturn the significators of 1, 5, 9 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="101" src="img/image013.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus the joint period rulers Mars, Mercury
and Saturn are respectively the owners of 11, 6 and 2. So they denote service
as the source of retirement.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The period ruler Mars is the significator
of 9, the sub period ruler Mercury is the significator of 1 and the inter
period ruler Saturn is the significator of 5.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Their Sub lords are also the significators
of 5, 12 and 9 respectively. So they are harmonious to the matters indicated by
the star lords</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the significators Mars, Mercury and
Saturn could during their joint period effect the event of retirement.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.9_9.
