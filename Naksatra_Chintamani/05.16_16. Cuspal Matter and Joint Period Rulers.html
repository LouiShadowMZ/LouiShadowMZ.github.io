1, the sub lord of the 2nd cusp is Mars. It is in the star Ketu and in the sub
Venus. After retirement from service the native received a good amount towards
gratuity on 27-6-1970 during the joint period of Mars, Ketu and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The houses 2, 6 and 11 are for monetary
gain. Now the cuspal sublord of the 2nd (Mars) is the owner of the 11th house
which is vacant. Its star lord Ketu represents Moon in 2, Mercury owning 6 and
Mars (Ketu's star lord) owning 11; so Mars is connected with 2, 6 and 11 and it
promises finance to the native. Its sublord Venus owns 10 and occupies 6; so it
is harmonious to the matters indicated by the star lord (Ketu). Hence Mars will
in its period give monetary gain to the native; and it may be realised during
the joint period of the planet Mars, the star lord Ketu and the sublord Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) It may therefore be said that if the
cuspal sub lord of a house is the significator of the matter signified by that
house, this matter will be materialised during the period etc of this cuspal
sublord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) On 27-6-1970 Moon was transitting in

1, the Asc is jointly ruled by Saturn, Moon and Rahu. They all are the
significators of 1 and 6 (Saturn owning 1 in star Sun in 6; Moon and Rahu both
are in star Mercury which owns 6 and aspects the Asc).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the native suffered from asthamatic
condition and kept bad health during the joint period of Moon, Rahu and Saturn
(16-10-1957 to 12-1-1968), also during the joint period of Moon, Saturn and
Rahu (1-5-1961 to 28-7-1961),</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) It may therefore be said that if the
joint rulers of the cusp of any house are the significators of the matter
signified by that house, the combined period of these joint rulers inter se
gives the results of the same matter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The native may suffer from sickness or
disease during the sub periods of the significators of 1 and 6 or 1 and 8 or 1
and 12 in the period of the significator of 6. He recovers during the sub
periods of the significators of 1, 5 or 11. He becomes a victim to the disease
in the sub periods of the significators of the badhaka and maraka houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sign and house occupied by the star
lord of the sub period ruler show the sensitive part of the body and the nature
of the disease.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1, the
period ruler is Moon and the sub period ruler Rahu is in the star Mercury in
Cancer; while the sub period ruler Saturn is in the star Sun in Gemini.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Gemini governs lungs, it shows bronchitis
and asthama etc. Cancer denotes stomach, it is a watery sign, so it indicates
weak digestive power, cold, cough and asthama etc.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.15_15. Transit and Joint Period Rulers.html">← 15.
