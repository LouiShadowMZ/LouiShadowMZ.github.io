writing and publication of books.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) If the cuspal sub lord of 3 and 11 be
Mercury (writings) or Jupiter (publications) or if it be the significator of 3
and 11 and if the star lord of this cuspal sub lord be connected with Mercury
and Jupiter the querent can write a book and publish it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) During the joint period of the
significators of 3 and 11 the book will be written and published. These
significators are generally connected with Mercury, Jupiter and Mars
(printing).</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.7_Publication of a Book_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map the sub lord of Moon is
Mercury (writings), it owns the 11th (sucess) and occupies the 3rd
(publications). So Moon is connected with 3 and 11. Hence it indicates that the
querent desires to have success in getting his writtings published.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.7_Publication of a Book_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3rd Cusp. The sub lord of the 3rd cusp is
Venus. It is in the star Jupiter (publications) in 3. The star lord Jupiter is
in conj. with Mercury and Venus owning 3. So Venus is the strong significator
of 3. But as the cuspal sub lord of 3 (Venus) is retrograde, the movement for
publication of a book will be made only after 3-12-1970 when Venus gets direct
in motion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th cusp. The sub lord of the 11th cusp is
Moon. It is in the sub Mercury; Mercury is direct in motion, it owns 11
(success), it is in conj. with Jupiter, the owner of 3 (Venus) and Sun (name).
Thus Moon is connected with 3 and 11; and also with Mercury and Jupiter. Hence
the querent will be successful in getting his book published.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.7_Publication of a Book_4"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="113" src="img/image080.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars is in the sub of retrograde Saturn.
Saturn is in the star of retrograde Venus. So Mars and Saturn may be omitted.
Hence the ruling planets are Moon, Venus and Ketu.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.7_Publication of a Book_5"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Moon Dasha balance
2Y 9M 27D) the querent is running the joint period of Moon and Mercury which
expires on 3-12-1970.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets viz, Moon and Venus are
the cuspal sub lords of 11 and 3 respectively; and they are also the strong
significators of 3 and 11 as previously discussed. So the book will be
published during the joint period of Moon and Venus which commences from
3-7-1971. Venus is very strong, so its inter period which continues upto
13-10-1971 will be very favourable. Hence during the joint period of Moon,
Venus and Venus the book will be published.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.7_Publication of a Book_6"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s book
was completely printed during September 1971 when Sun and Venus both were
transitting in Leo in the star Venus (the sub and inter period ruler). The book
was published during October 1971 when Sun was transitting in Virgo in the star
Moon (the period ruler).</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.6_News About The Missing Wife.html">← News About The Missing Wife</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.7_Publication of a Book">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.8_Constructing The Building.html">Constructing The Building →</a></div></body>
