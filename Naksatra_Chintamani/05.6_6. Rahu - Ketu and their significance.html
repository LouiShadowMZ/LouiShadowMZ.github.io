Rahu - Ketu and their significance_1"><span lang="EN-US">1. Rahu</span>–<span lang="EN-US">Ketu as agent</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu or Ketu is not allotted the ownership
of any sign. It only occupies the sign in a house. So Rahu or Ketu works as an
agent or representative of :</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) the planet with whom it is in conj. or
aspect.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) the owner of the sign in which it is
placed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Example birth horoscope no. 1 : (a) Rahu
occupies the house 2, it is in conj. with Moon which owns 7 and occupies 2. So
it will work as an agent of Moon and it will signify the matters of the houses
2 and 7.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is aspected by Mars which owns 4, 11
and occupies 7. So it will indicate the matters of the houses 4, 7 and 11 as an
agent of Mars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu occupies Pisces the sign owned by
Jupiter and it is also aspected by Jupiter which owns 3, 12 and occupies 10. So
as an agent of Jupiter it will denote the matters of 3, 10 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Ketu occupies the house 8, it is
aspected by Moon which owns 7 and occupies 2. So it will signify the matters of
2 and 7 as an agent of Moon and also of 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu occupies Virgo the sign owned by
Mercury which owns 6, 9 and occupies 7. So it will signify the matters of 6, 7
and 9 as an agent of Mercury.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.6_6. Rahu - Ketu and their significance_2"><span lang="EN-US">2. Rahu</span>–<span lang="EN-US">Ketu as Planet</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Keeping in view the above rule and the rule
that a planet gives the results indicated by its Star lord, we may say that
Rahu or Ketu gives firstly, the results of the planet in conj. with it;
secondly, the results of the planet aspecting it; thirdly, the results of its
own star lord and fourthly, the results of the owner of the sign occupied by
it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Example birth horoscope no. 1 : (a) As Rahu
is in conj. with Moon, it will firstly denote the results of Moon i.e. the
matters signified by the houses 2 and 7.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose Rahu is not in conj. or aspect with
any planet, then Rahu will indicate the results of its Star lord Mercury i.e.
the matters signified by the houses 6, 7 and 9.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Ketu is not in conj. with any planet,
but it is aspected by Moon. So it will give the results of Moon.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.6_6. Rahu - Ketu and their significance_3"><span lang="EN-US">3. Rahu</span>–<span lang="EN-US">Ketu as Star lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If any planet is in the Star of Rahu or
Ketu, that planet will signify the matters of the house occupied by Rahu or
Ketu; that planet will indicate the matters of the house owned and occupied by
the Star lord of Rahu or Ketu; that planet will denote the matters of the house
occupied or owned by the owner of the sign occupied by Rahu or Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Example birth horoscope no. 1 : (a) The
planet Mars is in the star of Ketu which occupies 8. So Mars will give the
results of the house 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The Star lord of Ketu is Mars which
occupies 7, owns 4 and 11. So the planet Mars will give the results of the
houses 4, 7 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Ketu occupies Virgo the sign owned by
Mercury which occupies 7, owns 6 and 9. So the planet Mars will give the
results of the houses 6, 7 and 9.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.6_6. Rahu - Ketu and their significance_4"><span lang="EN-US">4. Rahu</span>–<span lang="EN-US">Ketu as Significator</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu or Ketu is stronger than any planet.
So, if Rahu or Ketu represents any significator planet, Rahu</span>–<span lang="EN-US">Ketu should be given first preference as a significator in place of
that significator planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Example birth horoscope no. 1 : Rahu
represents Moon, Mars and Jupiter. So when we have to consider Moon, Mars or
Jupiter as a significator of the matter under consideration, Rahu should be
given first preference as a significator in place of Moon, Mars or Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, Ketu represents Moon and
Mercury. So Ketu should be preferred as a significator in place of the
significator Moon or Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Rahu and Ketu are not to be treated as
retrograded planets, because their natural movement is in the opposite
direction.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.5_5. Significators in their order.html">← 5.
