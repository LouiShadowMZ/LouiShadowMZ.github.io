lord of Moon denotes the Period ruler, its Sub lord shows the Sub period ruler
and its </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Sub sub</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> indicates the
Inter period ruler.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1, Moon
is in Pisces 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 49'. So it is ruled by the star lord
Mercury, the sub lord Sun and the </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Subsub</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> Jupiter. Hence it may be said that the native was born during the
period of Mercury, in the sub period of Sun and in the inter period of Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(2) When two planets are in the same sign
and/or have the same Starlord and the same Sublord, it happens that the period
and sub period of one proves fortunate, while that of the other planet is not
fortunate. In such cases the </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Sub sub</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> of these two planets will help us in knowing which of the two
planets will be fortunate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1, Sun
and Venus both are in the same sign Gemini 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 33' and
23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 00' respectively. They have the same star lord
Jupiter and the same sub lord Saturn. Out of them Sun proves favourable, while
Venus does not prove to be so. Because Sun is in the </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Sub
sub</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> of Venus which owns good houses 5 and 10; while
Venus is in the </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Sub sub</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> of
Sun which is the owner of an evil house 8. Hence the native prospered more
during the period of Sun than in the period of Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly, Mercury is in Cancer 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 2' and Jupiter is in Scorpio 14</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 2'. Both
have the same Star lord Saturn and the same Sub lord Rahu. Mercury is in the </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Sub sub</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> Rahu in the 2nd (being in conj.
with Moon the owner of 7 represents Moon). So Mercury gave more concrete
monetary benefits during its sub periods, than Jupiter which is in the </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Sub sub</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> Mercury the owner of 6.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(3) The Sub sub is very useful in finding
out the day or hour or minute of an event.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ascendant takes about two hours to move
from one sign to the other. It remains in one star for about 52 minutes. It
remains in one sub for about 5 to 8 minutes. So the exact minute can be noted
with the help of the Subsub.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon takes about 24 hours to move from one
star to the other. It remains in one </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Sub</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> for about three hours. So the exact hour can be noted with the help
of </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Sub sub</span>’<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p>
