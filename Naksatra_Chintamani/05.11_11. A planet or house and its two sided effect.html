A planet or house and its two sided effect_1"><span lang="EN-US">A planet favourable to one and adverse to another</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. The native of the example birth
horoscope no. 1 was gradually promoted to higher posts in service during the
period of Sun (13-12-1949 to 13-12-1955). So Sun proved a benefic planet to
him; while Sun proved a malefic planet to his father because it caused his
death during its period on 1-10-1955.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. (a) The houses 2, 6 and 10 are for
service. Sun is in the star Jupiter in the 10th. So it is the significator of
10 (promotion in service and status) the house of desirable or agreeable
matters to the native. Its sub lord Saturn owns 2 and it is harmonious to the
matters indicated by the star lord (Jupiter). Hence Sun gave favourable results
in service during its period and proved benefic to the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The badhaka and maraka houses show
death. Counted from the 9th cusp (Asc for the native's father) Sun is in the
star Jupiter which becomes the owner of the badhaka and maraka house 7 and the
occupant of the maraka house 2. So Sun becomes the significator of the badhaka
and maraka houses for the native's father; these houses signify undesirable and
adverse matters to the father. Its sub lord Saturn becomes the owner of 6
(sickness) and the occupant of 8 (death) and the significator of the maraka
house 12 (being in the star Sun owning 12) as counted from the 9th cusp, so it
is connected with the matters of the badhaka and maraka houses to the father as
indicated by the star lord (Jupiter). Hence Sun gave adverse results in respect
of longevity during its period and proved malefic to the native's father.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Thus it may be said that the
significator which is favourable to you, may prove unfavourable or malefic to
your father, mother or children etc. Similarly the house which shows desirable,
agreeable or favourable matters to you, may denote undesirable, adverse or
unfavourable matters to your father, mother or children etc.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.11_11. A planet or house and its two sided effect_2"><span lang="EN-US">A planet both favourable and adverse to the native</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. In the example birth horoscope no. 1 the
native suffered from chronic asthamatic condition every now and then during the
whole period of Moon (13-12-1955 to 13-12-1965). So it proved malefic in
respect of health; while it proved benefic in service because the native was
promoted to the highest post carrying responsibilities, status and position
with powers during his service career in this period of Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. (a) The house 6 denotes sickness and
disease. Moon is in the star Mercury which owns 6 and occupies 7 (maraka). So
it is the significator of 6 and 7 the houses of undesirable and adverse matters
in respect of health. Its sub lord Sun owns 8 (chronic ailment and troubles)
and occupies 6. So Sun is connected with the matters indicated by the star lord
(Mercury). Hence Moon gave unfavourable results in respect of health and proved
malefic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The house 6 also shows service matters.
Moon is in the star Mercury which owns 6. So it is the significator of 6 the
house of desirable, agreeable or advantageous matters to the native. Its sub
lord Sun occupies 6 and it is the significator of 10 (being in the Star Jupiter
in 10). So Sun is harmonious to the matters of the star lord (Mercury). Hence
Moon gave favourable results in respect of service and proved benefic</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Thus it may be said that neither any
planet nor any house is wholly benefic or wholly malefic. But a planet is
benefic to you if it is in the star of the occupant or owner of the house
signifying desirable matters which you expect; and if its sub lord is connected
with in the matters of that house, so that you may enjoy the results in full.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.10_10.
