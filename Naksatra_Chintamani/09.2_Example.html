<body><h2 id="heading_09.2_Example_0"><span lang="EN-US">Example</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Suppose you want to find out the position
of the cusps of the houses for the number 145 out of 249 for the year 1970.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now look to the Table C for Subs in the
chapter </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">2. Sub in Nakshatra System</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> on page 8. Note the particulars about the No. 145 as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="42" src="img/image066.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Take 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 26'
40" Libra as the Asc, according to the Nirayana System,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We have to calculate the other 11 cusps for
the latitude of the place from where we judge the query, from Raphael</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Table of Houses which is according to the Sayana system. So
proceed as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="346" src="img/image067.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="190" src="img/image068.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There are the Sayana cusps for the number.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Prepare cusps of 12 houses for every number
between 1 and 249 in this manner. These cusps will be the Sayana cusps for the
houses 10, 11, 12, 2 and 3. So far as the Asc. is concerned keep the commencing
position of the Sub according to the Nirayana System as it is e. g. for the
number 145 keep Libra 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 26' 40" as it is,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Sayana cusps (for the houses 10, 11,
12, 2 and 3) for all 249 numbers will remain constant for any year. For getting
the Nirayana cusps you have only to deduct the Ayanamsa for the required year.
So It is desirable to keep a ready reckoner for the place of your permanent
stay. This will save much of your time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="234" src="img/image069.jpg" width="553"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These are the Nirayana Cusps of 12 houses
for the number 145. Thus a horary map of the Cusps is ready.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You have only to work out the position of
the planets for the time of judging the query and to insert them in the map.
Then the horary map is ready for judgment.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.1_Erecting the Horary Map.html">← V Example Horary Maps</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.2_Example">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.3_Judging the Horary Map.html">Judging the Horary Map →</a></div></body>
