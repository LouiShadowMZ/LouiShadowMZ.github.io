ruling planets show the time of fulfilment of a question asked. The question
may relate to a minor or major event, it matters little.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When there is a strong desire, keenness,
anxiousness, eagerness or urge from within to know the result about any matter,
then and then only you may predict with the help of ruling planets alone; and
you may prove correct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ruling planets which are in the star or
sub of retrograde planets should be avoided.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A retrograde ruling planet shall give the
results only when it becomes direct in motion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sensitive degree of any Zodiacal sign
in which all the ruling planets jointly operate is important for fulfilment of
any question.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The question is fulfilled at the time when
all the ruling planets operate jointly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In joint operation one of the ruling
planets becomes the Sign lord, the other one becomes the Star lord, the third
one the Sub lord and the fourth one becomes the Sub sub lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) If an event is likely to happen within
24 hours take the transit of the Asc. and count from the ascending degree of
the moment of the query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is to happen within a month consider
the transit of Moon and count from the Sign transitted by Moon at the moment of
the query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is to happen after a month but within
a year look to the transit of Sun and count from the sign transitted by Sun at
the moment of the query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally ruling planets are five in
number. The three ruling planets which you come across earlier in joint
operation should be considered first. From the rest of the two that which is
earlier in joint operation should be considered as the Sub sub lord. Of course,
no hard and fast rule can be given. The reader may form his own rules according
to his experience.</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.4_4. Ruling Planets and Fulfilment of a Question_1"><span lang="EN-US">Examples </span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(1) Question </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> When

So it
represents Saturn. Thus the ruling planets are Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the question is a minor one, it is a
matter to be fulfilled within a few minutes or an hour. So take the transit of
the Asc. and count from the ascending degree of the moment i.e. Sagittarius 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> and get the degree on which all the
ruling planets operate jointly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sagittarius 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> 40</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> to 20</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> 40</span>″<span lang="EN-US"> is the area on which Jupiter, Venus and

the Asc. the discussion will be stopped.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This degree was on the Asc. at about 3</span>–<span lang="EN-US">50 P.M. I.S.T. and immediately a female relative entered the house

Venus, Mars, Rahu and Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the matter is to happen within a week or
so, take the transit of Moon and count from the sign transitted by Moon at the
