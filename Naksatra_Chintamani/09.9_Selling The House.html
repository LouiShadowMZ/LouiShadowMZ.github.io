<body><h2 id="heading_09.9_Selling The House_0"><span lang="EN-US">Selling The House</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Question. When shall I be able to sell my
house?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 25 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 41</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 55</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment. 24-1-1972, Monday: 4-35
p.m. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="618" src="img/image084.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="96" src="img/image085.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.9_Selling The House_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of 10 be the
significator (i. e. in the star of the occupant or owner) of 3 or 10 the house
can be sold off during the joint period of the significators of 3, 5 and 10.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.9_Selling The House_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map Moon owns 4 and occupies
12. It is in the star Venus owning 1, 2 and occupying 10; and in the sub
Mercury owning 3 and 6. So Moon is the significator of 1 (self), 2 (money), 10
(house to the buyer) and connected with 3 (parting with the house), 6 (gain
from others), 4 (house) and 12 (losing the house). Hence it clearly indicates
that the querent intends to sell his house and to gain money therefrom by
parting with the house.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.9_Selling The House_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10th Cusp. The sub lord of the 10th cusp is
Ketu. Ketu occupies 3. It is in the star Saturn owning 10. So Ketu is the
significator of 10 and connected with 3; and it promises the sale of the house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As the star lord Saturn is retrograde, Ketu
(if it be among the joint period rulers of the significators of 3; 5 and 10)
cannot give the results of its star lord regarding the sale of the house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So let us make sure by examining the Asc.
(efforts by the querent), the 11th cusp (success or fulfilment of desire) and
the 4th cusp (building of the querent), if they promise the sale of the house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Asc. The sub lord of the Asc. is Saturn. It
is in the star Sun owning 5 and in the sub Mercury owning 3. So Saturn is the
significator of 5 and connected with 3. Hence the querent is sure to sell his
house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But Saturn the sub lord of the Asc. is
retrograde. So the querent has to wait till Saturn gets direct in motion and
crosses the original point of retrogradation from where it turned retrograde.
Saturn turned retrograde on 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">11</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Taurus and it crosses this point on 5-5-1972 by direct motion.
Hence the event of sale will happen only after 5-5-1972 during the joint period
of the significators of 3, 5 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th Cusp. The sub lord of the 11th cusp is
Mars. It is in the star Mercury owning 3 and in the sub Rahu (representing
Saturn owning 10 and Sun owning 5 because Rahu is in conj. with Sun in
Capricorn). So Mars is the significator of 3 and connected with 5 and 10. Hence
the querent will be able to fulfil his desire by selling the house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4th Cusp. The 4th cusp is jointly ruled by
Moon (sign lord), Mercury (star lord) and Venus (sub lord). Moon is the
significator of 3 and 10 as previously discussed. Mercury is in the star Venus
in 10 and in its own sub (Mercury owning 3). So it is also the significator of
10 and connected with 3. Venus is in the star Rahu (representing Saturn owning
10 and Sun owning 5) and in its own sub (Venus in 10). So it is also the
significator of 5, 10 and connected with 10. All these three planets indicate
the disposal of the house.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.9_Selling The House_4"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="84" src="img/image086.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu is in Cancer, so it represents Moon.
Thus the ruling planets are Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Rahu and Ketu.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.9_Selling The House_5"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of 3_ 5 and 10.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus and Ketu are the
significators of 3, 5 and 10 as discussed above. Ketu being in the star of
retrograde Saturn may be omitted. Mars being in the sub Rahu which is not a
significator of 3, 5 or 10 may be omitted. Thus Moon, Mercury and Venus remain
as the final significators of 3, 5 and 10.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.9_Selling The House_6"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (balance dasha of
Venus 3Y 8M 3D) the querent is running the joint period of Venus, Mercury and
Mercury the significators of 3, 5 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As seen from the earlier paragraphs the
event of sale is to occur only after 5-5-1972. So by this time the joint period
of Venus, Mercury and Venus will be current from 21-4-1972 upto 1-10-1972 and
during this interval the sookshma period of Moon the significator commences on
27-5-1972 and lasts upto 12-6-1972. Hence the querent will be able to sell his
house during these days when the transit agrees with the joint period ruler or
rulers.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.9_Selling The House_7"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was learnt from the querent that he
received a cheque of full amount from the buyer on 28-5-1972 during the joint
period of Venus, Mercury, Venus and Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On that day Sun was transitting in Taurus
14</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in the star Moon (the sookshma period ruler); Moon
in Scorpio 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in the star Mercury (the sub period
ruler) and Mercury in Taurus 5</span>°<span lang="EN-US">15</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in its own sub.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.8_Constructing The Building.html">← Constructing The Building</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.9_Selling The House">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.10_Lease Licence for Mines.html">Lease Licence for Mines →</a></div></body>
