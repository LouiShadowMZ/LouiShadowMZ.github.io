house are judged from the significators of that house. So the occupant, the
owner, a planet in the star of the occupant and a planet in the star of the
owner of that house become the significators of that house. Hence note the
significators.  </span></p><h3 id="heading_05.4_4. Significators_1"><span lang="EN-US">Example birth horoscope no. 1</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The significators of each house are shown
