<body><h2 id="heading_05.12_12. Elimination of Significators_0"><span lang="EN-US">12. Elimination of Significators</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. An event happens during the joint period
(i.e. during the period, sub period, inter period and sookshma period) of the
significators of the houses under consideration.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. In cases where the significators of the
houses under consideration exceed more than four, the unimportant significators
should be eliminated as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Preference should be given to Rahu or
Ketu if it represents any significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The planet whose sublord is the
significator of the house detrimental to the house or houses under
consideration should be eliminated first.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. The order of the period rulers becomes
fixed according to the sign position of Moon at the time of birth in each case.
So one cannot avoid this. Hence if the period ruler is in any manner connected
with the matter of the house under consideration or if it be the chief governor
of the matter under consideration, it is to be considered as an important
significator of the matter under consideration.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.12_12.

retain Ketu. As Sun's sublord Saturn occupies the 1st house of the mother omit
it. So Ketu, Venus and Rahu become the final significators of the badhaka and
maraka houses as counted from the 4th for the native's mother.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The native's mother died on 1-11-1923
during the joint period of Ketu, Venus and Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="163" src="img/image015.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is in the sub Sun which occupies the
6th, so omit it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury, Ketu, Rahu and Jupiter are in the
sub Rahu which occupies the 2nd and which is the significator of the 7th. So
retain them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It may be noted that the native passed the
periods of Mercury and Ketu in his child hood. The period of Rahu will start in
his old age and there is no scope for the period of Jupiter. So these
significator planets will work as sub period, inter period or sookshma period
rulers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The native was running the period of Venus
since 13-1-1929 and it continued up to 13-1-1949. Venus is the chief governor
of marriage. It is in the star of Jupiter and in the sub Saturn owning 2. The
star lord Jupiter aspects the 7th cusp, Moon owning 7, Mercury in 7 and Rahu in
2. So Venus is a strong significator of marriage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The native got married on 13-12-1937 during
the joint period of Venus, Rahu, Jupiter and Rahu.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.11_11. A planet or house and its two sided effect.html">← 11.
