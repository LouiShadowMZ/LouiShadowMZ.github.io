<body><h2 id="heading_09.16_Marriage_0"><span lang="EN-US">Marriage</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Question. When will my daughter get
married?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 145 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2', 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35'</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment 27-6-1970, Saturday; 5-30
P.M. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="555" src="img/image104.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="132" src="img/image105.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.16_Marriage_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of the 7th be the
significator of 2, 7 or 11 marriage takes place during the joint period of the
significators of 2, 7 and 11.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.16_Marriage_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map the father put the query
about the marriage of his daughter. So consider the 5th house as the Asc. for
the daughter and proceed. For convenience the roman letter is given to each
house counted from the 5th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon occupies the Asc. of the daughter. It
is in the star Mercury owning VII and in the sub Saturn owning XI and occupying
II. So it is the significator of VII (marriage of the daughter) and connected
with II (family life) and XI (permanent relationship). Thus Moon clearly
indicates that the query refers to the marriage of the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s daughter.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.16_Marriage_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp VII. The sub lord of VII cusp is
Saturn. It owns XI and occupies II. It is in the star Venus (the natural
significator of marriage) and in the sub Mercury owning VII. So Saturn is
connected with II, VII and XI. The cuspal sub lord Saturn and its star lord
Venus both are direct in motion. Hence the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s
daughter will get married</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.16_Marriage_4"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="104" src="img/image106.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu in Aquarius represents Saturn. So the
ruling planets are Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and Rahu. None of them is in
the star or sub of a retrograde planet.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.16_Marriage_5"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of Marriage</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="150" src="img/image107.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu represents Saturn. So take it as the
significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The common planets between the ruling
planets and the significators are Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and Rahu.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.16_Marriage_6"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Mercury Dasha
balance 1Y 2M 16D) the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s daughter is running
the joint period of Mercury and Saturn. They are among the significators. Now
we have to select the inter period ruler out of the remaining significators
Mars, Jupiter and Rahu. Rahu being stronger than any significator should be considered
as the inter period ruler.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus we have to consider the joint period
of Mercury, Saturn and Rahu which starts from 8-12-1970 and lasts upto
3-5-1971.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury owns VII, Saturn is the cuspal sub
lord of VII and Rahu is the cuspal sub lord of XI. So the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s daughter will get married during their joint period when the
transit agrees.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.16_Marriage_7"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During the time from 8-12-1970 to 3-5-1971
Sun will first transit in the star of Rahu from 19-2-1971. So the marriage will
take place in the month of February 1971.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Actually the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s daughter got married on 19-2-1971, when Sun was transitting in
Aquarius 6</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 50' in the star Rahu (the inter period
ruler); Moon in Scorpio 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 0' in the star Mercury (the
period ruler); Mercury in Capricorn 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 58' in the sub
Rahu; Saturn in Aries 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 19' in its own sub Saturn
(the sub period ruler); and Rahu in Capricorn 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 59'
in the sub Saturn.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.15_Independent Business.html">← Independent Business</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.16_Marriage">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.17_Overseas For Studies.html">Overseas For Studies →</a></div></body>
