The native of this horoscope is a double
graduate, a very intelligent and a widely read man. But he is penniless and not
steady in life. Because the planets are peculiarly connected with the houses 6,
8 and 12 in general. We will discuss some planets dealing with the houses 2 and
10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. The planet Moon is in the star Jupiter
which owns the 2nd, occupies the 8th and is retrograde. It is in the sub
Mercury which owns 8 and is retrograde. Thus Moon is the significator of 2 and
8 and connected with 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The star lord Jupiter occupies the 8th from
its own sign Sagittarius which is on the 2nd cusp. So Jupiter becomes weak to
give the results of the 2nd house. Hence the planet Moon automatically becomes
weak to give the results of the 2nd house. Moreover its sub lord Mercury owns
8, consequently the planet Moon cannot give desirable results regarding money
matters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. The planet Mercury is in the star and
sub of Jupiter. So it is the significator of 2 and 8; and as discussed above
Mercury is also unable to improve the monetary condition of the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. The planet Venus is in the star Mercury
which owns 10 and 8 and is retrograde. It is in the sub Ketu (which being in
the star Venus owning 12 represents Venus) in 1. Thus the planet Venus is the
significator of 8, 10 and connected with 1 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The star lord Mercury occupies the 6th from
its own sign Virgo which is on the 10th cusp. So Mercury becomes weak to give
the results of the 10th house. Hence the planet Venus automatically becomes
weak to give the results of the 10th house. Moreover its sub lord Ketu being
connected with 12, the planet Venus cannot give desirable results regarding
advancement in service or profession, status or honourable living etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. In this horoscope Rahu in Gemini
represents Mercury the owner of 8; and Ketu represents Venus the owner of 12.
Except Saturn all the planets have to give the results of 8 and 12, because
they are either in the star or sub of Rahu, Ketu, Mercury or Venus. So they
bring poverty.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. The native was born during the period of
Jupiter with balance of 9Y 3M 4D. At present he is running the period of Venus
since 28-5-1960.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In fact in the periods of Saturn, Mercury,
Ketu and Venus during the sub periods of Moon and Mercury the native suffered
hardships in finance and during the sub periods of Venus he could not build his
career, but he experienced difficulties and he is a pauper throughout his life.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.12_Mystery of 6_ 8 and 12_1"><span lang="EN-US">Parental building sold off</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1 (a) The 4th house is occupied by the
owner of 12 (Venus). The owner of 4 (Jupiter) occupies the 8th and it is
aspected by the owner of 1 and 6 (Mars). So the house 4 is connected with the
house 12 (loss) and the owner of 4 is connected with the house 1 (self), 6
(debt) and 8 (gain to others). This denotes that the native will have to lose
the building on account of debt.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The sub lord of the 10th cusp (building
to the buyer) is Jupiter. Jupiter owns 4, it is in the star Saturn owning 3 and
in the sub Rahu (representing Mercury which owns 10 and occupies 3). So Jupiter
is the significator of 3 (absence of building, it being 12 to 4) and connected
with 3 &amp; 10 (building to the buyer); and it indicates selling away of the
building. The star lord Saturn is in conj. with the owner of 12 (Venus-losing
the building).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. The building was sold off during the
period of Venus in 1960 or so. Venus owns the 12th and occupies the 4th, it is
in the star Mercury owning 10 and occupying 3; and in the sub Ketu
(representing Venus owning 12). So Venus is the significator of 3, 10 and
connected with 12. Hence the native lost his building.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.12_Mystery of 6_ 8 and 12_2"><span lang="EN-US">Characteristics</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ascending sign Scorpio (which
corresponds to the 8th house), its owner Mars (in the star Ketu representing
JupiterR in 8), its star lord MercuryR (owns 8, in the star and the sub
JupiterR in 8) and its sub lord Moon (in the star JupiterR in 8 and in the sub
MercuryR owning 8) are closely connected with the house 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">His out look on life, his mentality, his
way of life and his personal attributes centre round the 8th house. So he leads
a shabby and uncleanly life and he is the architect of his own misfortune.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.11_Purchasing the Building.html">← Purchasing the Building</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.12_Mystery of 6_ 8 and 12">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.13_Marriage and Divorce.html">Marriage and Divorce →</a></div></body>
