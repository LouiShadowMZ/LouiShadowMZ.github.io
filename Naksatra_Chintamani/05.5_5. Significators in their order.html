<body><h2 id="heading_05.5_5. Significators in their order_0"><span lang="EN-US">5. Significators in their order</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the horoscope the sign is on the cusp of
each house. A planet always occupies the sign and its strength is determined
according as it occupies its own sign, exalted sign or debilitated sign. So the
occupant in a sign is stronger than the owner of the sign.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sign is the 1/12th part of the Zodiac,
while the Constellation or Star is the 1/27th part of the Zodiac. So the
Constellation or Star is stronger than the sign.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the planet in the star is stronger
than its Star lord (which may be either the occupant or the owner of the
sign).  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The occupant (planet) in a sign mostly
gives the results of the house occupied by it. So the planet in the star better
gives the results of the house occupied by its star lord.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Keeping these principles in mind the order
or strength of the significators of each house should be determined as
under:  </span></p><h3 id="heading_05.5_5. Significators in their order_1"><span lang="EN-US">Planet in the occupant</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A planet in the star of the occupant of a
house is stronger than the occupant. So it should be given first preference as
a significator of that house, because it is strongest to give the results of
the house occupied by its Star lord. The occupant remains as a weak
significator of that house.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1,
Saturn is the occupant of the 4th house. Mercury and Jupiter are in the star of
Saturn the occupant. So they are stronger than their star lord Saturn, because
they are the strongest to give the results of the 4th house. Hence Mercury and
Jupiter are the strong significators of the 4th and Saturn is a weak
significator.  </span></p><h3 id="heading_05.5_5. Significators in their order_2"><span lang="EN-US">Occupant</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If there is no planet in the occupant</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Star, the occupant becomes the strong significator of that house
and it is strong to give the results of that house. So the second preference
should be given to the occupant of that house.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1, Moon
and Rahu are the occupants of the 2nd house. There is no planet in their stars.
So they are the strong significators of the 2nd house and they are strong to
give the results of the 2nd house.  </span></p><h3 id="heading_05.5_5. Significators in their order_3"><span lang="EN-US">Planet in the owner</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the house is vacant, the planet in the
star of the owner of a house is stronger than the owner. So it becomes a strong
significator of that house and it is strong to give the results of that house.
Hence the third preference should be given to the planet in the owner</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star and the owner remains a weak significator of that
house.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1, the
3rd and the 12th houses are vacant. Jupiter is the owner of these houses. Sun
and Venus are in the star of Jupiter the owner. So they are stronger than their
Star lord Jupiter to give the results of the 3rd and the 12th. Hence Sun and
Venus are the strong significators of the houses 3 and 12, while Jupiter is a
weak significator.  </span></p><h3 id="heading_05.5_5. Significators in their order_4"><span lang="EN-US">Owner</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the house is vacant and if there is no
planet in the owner</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star, the owner itself becomes
the strong significator of that house and it is strong to give the results of
that house. So the 4th preference should be given to the owner of that
house.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1, the
5th house is vacant. Venus is the owner of the 5th. There is no planet in the
star of Venus the owner. So Venus becomes the strong significator of the 5th
house and it is strong to give the results of the 5th house.  </span></p><h3 id="heading_05.5_5. Significators in their order_5"><span lang="EN-US">Planet in Conj. or Aspect</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) A planet in conj. or association with,
or aspected by a significator gives the results of the house or houses denoted
by that significator. So the last preference should be given to the planet in
conj. or aspect with that significator.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1, Sun
is in conj. with Venus the significator of the 5th house (as discussed above).
So Sun will give the results of the 5th house as denoted by Venus the
significator.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon and Rahu are aspected by Jupiter the
significator of the 4th house (as already discussed). So both Moon and Rahu
will give the results of the 4th house as denoted by the significator
Jupiter.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) A planet aspecting the house may be
considered as the significator of that house.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1,
Saturn aspects the 7th, 11th and 2nd cusps. So it becomes the significator of
these houses. Similarly Jupiter aspects the 3rd, 5th and 7th cusps. So it
becomes the significator of these houses and so on with other planets.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence it may be said that planets e.g.
Mercury and Jupiter in the Star of Saturn will indicate the matters of 2, 7 and
11 and so on with other planets.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.5_5. Significators in their order_6"><span lang="EN-US">Example Birth Horoscope No. 1.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Table-House wise Significators in their
order</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This table is prepared according to the
rules discussed above. It is self explanatory as under 1:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Explanation : The planets in (Italics) are
the strong significators of the house shown against them in the column (a),
while the other planets remain as weak significators of that house; e.g. (S, V)
are the strong significators of the houses 3, 10 and 12. So they are strong to
give the results of these houses and so on.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.4_4. Significators.html">← 4.
