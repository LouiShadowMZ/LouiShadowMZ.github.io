Cuspal sublord and its Subject matter_1"><span lang="EN-US">Significance of the cuspal sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The cuspal sublord of a house indicates
whether the matter signified by that house is promised or denied.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of that house is the
significator of that house or any one of the houses under consideration, the
matter signified by that house will be promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As each house denotes several particular
matters, the chief governor of the matter to be judged, may be taken into
consideration. If it be connected with the house or any one of the houses under
consideration, especially with the star lord of the cuspal sublord, it is
desirable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The principle regarding the significators
as explained in the chapter, 'Significators in their order' should always be
kept in mind.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.13_13. Cuspal sublord and its Subject matter_2"><span lang="EN-US">Time of event</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of a house promises
the matter of that house, then only during the joint period of the
significators of the matter signified by the house or houses under
consideration, the results of that matter are experienced; otherwise not.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="338" src="img/image016.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu being aspected by Moon denotes the
houses 2 and 7.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.13_13. Cuspal sublord and its Subject matter_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp and subject matters</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Longevity: 1. If the sublord of the Asc
(ascending degree) is the owner of:</span>–</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) the house 6, 8 or 12 a short life (up
to 33 years) is indicated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) the house 1, 5, 9 or 10 a long life
(beyond 66 years);</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) the house 6, 8 or 12 and 1, 5, 9 or 10
a middle life (up to 66 years) is denoted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Besides, if this sublord is the
significator (i.e. in the star of the occupant or owner) of the badhaka and the
maraka houses, it is not a good sign for long life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Likewise, consider the sublords of the 3rd
and the 8th cusps also.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. (a) In the example birth horoscope no.
1, the longevity of the native's mother may be examined. Consider the sublord
of the 4th cusp (the Asc for the mother). Its sublord Mercury is the owner of
the 6th counted from the 4th cusp. It is in the star of Saturn which is the
owner of the badhaka house 11 counted from the 4th cusp. So the sublord of the
mother's Asc (Mercury) is the significator of the badhaka house. Hence the
longevity of the native's mother is short.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Venus is the sublord both of the 8th
and the 3rd cusps counted from the 4th cusp. It is in the star of Jupiter which
is the owner of the maraka house 12 and which is the occupant of the maraka
house 7 counted from the 4th cusp. So Venus is the significator of the maraka
houses for the mother. Hence the life of the native's mother is short.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The native's mother died on 1-11-1923
during the joint period of Ketu, Venus and Rahu the significators of the
badhaka and maraka houses as the counted from the 4th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Health: If the sublord of the Asc
(ascending degree) is in the star of the occupant of the house 1 or 11, health
is normal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is in the star of the occupant or
owner of 6 (sickness or disease), 8(danger to life) or 12(bed ridden sickness),
it is not good for health.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1 the
sub lord of the Asc is Rahu. It is in the star of Mercury owning 6 and
occupying 7. So it becomes the significator of 6 and 7 (maraka). Hence the
native will suffer from disease or sickness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Disease: If the sublord of the 6th cusp is
in the star of the occupant or owner of 6 or 1 the native may suffer from
disease.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) In the example birth horoscope no. 1
the sublord of the 6th cusp is Venus. It occupies the 6th (there is no planet
in its star, so it is the strong significator of 6). It is in the star Saturn
owning the Asc. Hence it is the significator of 1 and 6. So the native will
suffer from disease.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The native became susceptible to
asthamatic condition since 1951 in the joint period of Sun and Rahu. The sub
periods of Moon, Rahu and Saturn indicate ill-health, because they are the
significators of 6 and connected with 1, 8 and 12. In fact they proved evil to
the native for health.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Accident: If the sublord of the Asc or of
the 8th cusp is in the star of the occupant or owner of the 8th or 12th the
native will meet with an accident.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the sub lord is in the star of the
occupant or owner of 8, 7 or 2 the accident will prove fatal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is in the star of the occupant or
owner of 2 or 7 and 11 the native will survive.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1 the
sub lord of the Asc and of the 8th cusp is Rahu. It is not in the star of the
occupant or owner of 8 or 12. So the native will not meet with any accident in
life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Education: If the sub lord of the 4th cusp
is Mercury or Jupiter; or if it is in the star of the occupant or owner of 4, 9
or 11 and if its star lord is connected with Mercury and/or Jupiter the native
will get academic qualifications.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) In the example birth horoscope no. 1
the sub lord of the 4th cusp is Mercury owning 9. Moreover this sub lord is in
the star Saturn which occupies the 4th, so it is the significator of the 4th
and its star lord (Saturn) aspects both Mercury and Jupiter, hence the star
lord (Saturn) is connected with them. The native will therefore get academic
qualifications.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The native could receive education
during the periods of Mercury, Ketu and Venus the significators of 4 and 11 up
to 1941. He got degrees in the sub periods of Moon and Jupiter the
significators of 4 and 9 during the period of Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Building: 1. If the sub lord of the 4th
cusp is in the star of the occupant or owner of 4, 11 or 12 and Mars or Saturn
is connected with this house, the native will have his own building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) In the example birth horoscope no, 1
the sub lord of the 4th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Saturn which is in
the 4th. So it is the significator of the 4th. Hence a residential house of his
own is promised to the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Mercury owns 6 (loan) and occupies 7
(Government or Co-operative Society). Its star lord Saturn occupies 4 (land or
building), owns 2 (money) and 1 (self). Its sub lord Rahu occupies 2; Rahu is
in conj. with Moon owning 7, is aspected by Mars owning 4 and 11, is aspected
by Jupiter owning 12 (investment).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury is the source of an event i.e. loan
from Government or Co-operative Society will be the source.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Its star lord Saturn indicates the results
regarding money and land or building for self.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Its sub lord Rahu being connected with 2,
4, 7, 11 and 12 (the same matters of the star lord) shows that the results will
be favourable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In short, Mercury indicates that the native
will get money as loan from Govt. or Co-operative Society, and will invest it
in constructing a building for him,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The native could occupy his newly
constructed building during the joint period of Moon, Jupiter and Mercury the
significators of 4, 11 or 12 in 1959.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. If the sub lord of the 10th cusp is the
significator of 3 or 10 the native will be required to sell his building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1 the
sub lord of the 10th cusp is Mercury. It is not in the star of the occupant or
owner of 3 or 10. So it is not the significator of 3 or 10. Hence the native
will not be required to sell his building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Marriage: If the sub lord of the 7th cusp
is the significator of 2, 7 or 11 the native will marry.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is the significator of 1, 6 or 10 the
native will not marry.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) In the example birth horoscope no. 1
the sub lord of the 7th cusp is Mars. It occupies the 7th. It is in the star
Ketu; Ketu represents Moon owning 7, Mercury in 7 and its star lord Mars owning
11 and in 7; thus Ketu has to give the results of 7 and 11. Hence Mars is the
significator of 7 and 11. So marriage is promised to the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The native got married on 13-12-1937
during the joint period of Venus, Rahu and Jupiter the significators of 2, 7
and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Children: If the sub lord of the 5th cusp
is the significator of 2, 5 or 11 child birth is promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If it is the significator of 1, 4 or 10
child birth is not promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In case of females the 5th house and in
case of males the 11th house should be examined first.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) In the example birth horoscope no. 1
the native is male. The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Venus. It is the owner of
the 5th. There is no planet in its star and the 5th house is vacant. So it is
the strong significator of the 5th.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further Venus is in the star Jupiter the
chief governor of child birth and Jupiter aspects the 5th cusp. Hence Venus
promises child birth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The sub lord of the 5th cusp is also
Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The birth of children took place during
the joint period of the significators of 2, 5 or 11 Venus, Mercury and Mercury
in 1946; Venus, Ketu and Mars in 1949; Sun, Jupiter and Ketu in 1952; and Moon,
Moon and Jupiter in 1956.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Profession/Service: If the sub lord of the
10th cusp or the 6th cusp is the significator of 2, 6 or 10 the native will
earn money either in profession or service.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) In the example birth horoscope no. 1
the sublord of the 10th cusp is Mercury. It is in the star Saturn owning 2. So
it is the significator of 2. Hence the native will earn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The sublord of the 6th cusp is Venus.
It occupies the 6th and owns the 10th. There is no planet in its star. So it is
the strong significator of 6 and it being in the star Jupiter in 10, is the
strong significator of 10 also. Hence service is promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The native got his first employment
during the joint period of Venus, Mars and Rahu the significators of 2, 6, 10
or 11 in 1936.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lottery: If the sub lord of the 11th cusp
is in the star of the occupant or owner of 2, 6 or 11 and not in the star of
the occupant or owner of 8, 12 or 5 (i.e. 2, 6 and 11 from the 7th </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> gain to the opposite party) and if it is connected with the house 3
the native will gain through lottery.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no, 1 the
sub lord of the 11th cusp is Venus. It is not in the star of the occupant or
owner of 2, 6 or 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the contrary it is the owner of 5, the
house 5 is vacant, there is no planet in the star of Venus, so Venus is the
strong significator of 5.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is in the star of Jupiter owning 12
which is vacant. So it is the strong significator of 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence there is no likelihood of winning
lottery.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">‘<span lang="EN-US">Significator</span>’<span lang="EN-US">. The
phrase </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">a particular planet is the significator of a
particular house is commonly used throughout the book. In stellar astrology a
planet has to give the results of its star lord. So the term </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">significator</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> in its strict sense is to be
understood as a planet in the star of the occupant or owner of a house under
consideration.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.13_13. Cuspal sublord and its Subject matter_4"><span lang="EN-US">General Instructions</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. For judging any matter in the horoscope
pertaining to any particular house, bear in mind the general principle that a
planet gives the results of its star lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Give importance to the cuspal sublord of
the house to be judged; treat it as an ordinary planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Note its star lord, note the sign and
the house occupied by the star lord.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Remember the general rule that each sign
corresponds to a particular house e.g. Aries to the 1st house, Cancer to the
4th and so on. Also bear in mind that each house corresponds to a particular
sign e.g. the 1st house represents Aries, the 6th house to Virgo and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Remember the characteristics e.g.
personal appearance, disposition, disease, occupation and matters governed or
dominated by each sign and planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Combine the influence of the star lord,
that of the sign occupied by it and also of the house occupied by it suitably
as the case may be; and follow the suit in respect of the cuspal sublord also.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. The strength of the cuspal sub lord of a
house should also be examined for affairs or matters of that house,</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.12_12. Elimination of Significators.html">← 12.
