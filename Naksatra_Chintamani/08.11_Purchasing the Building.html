significator of 4, 11 or 12 and if Mars or Saturn is connected with the house
4, then the native will have his own building during the joint period of the
significators of 4, 11 and 12.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.11_Purchasing the Building_2"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sublord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4th cusp (a) The sub lord of the 4th cusp
is Moon. It owns 12. Its star lord Saturn aspects the 4th and 11th and is
aspected by Mars owning 4. Its sub lord Jupiter aspects the 11th and Mars both.
So Moon is the significator of 4, 11 and connected with 4, 11, 12 and Mars.
Hence the cuspal sub lord of 4 promises the native a building of his own to
dwell in.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The cuspal sub lord of 4 Moon owns 12.
It is in the star Saturn owning 6, 7 and occupying 2. It is in the sub Jupiter
owning 8 and occupying 3. So Moon is the significator of 2 (money), 6 (money by
loan or in any manner), 7 (money lender or bank or the transacting person) and
connected with 3 (bargain), 8 (sudden gain) and 12 (investment). Hence the sub
lord of the 4th cusp promises that the native will have a sudden gain of money.
He will bargain with the transacting person in connection with the building
(because the star lord Saturn and the sub lord Jupiter both are in aspect with
Mars owning 4) and will get money. He will also borrow money from the money
lender i.e. Bank and he will spend money for purchasing a building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2nd cusp. As the cuspal sub lord of 4 shows
sudden gain of money, the 2nd cusp which is the principal house for money
should be examined. It is jointly ruled by Mercury (sign lord), Sun (star lord)
and Venus (sub lord).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mercury is in its own star owning 2 and 11
in 4. So it is the significator of 2, 4 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun is in the star Mercury owning 2 and 11
in 4 and in the sub Moon owning and occupying 12. So it is the significator of
2, 4 and 11; and connected with 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus is in the star Jupiter owning 8 and
sub Rahu (Rahu in Virgo represents Mercury owning 2, 11 and occupying 4; it is
in association with Saturn owning 6, 7 and occupying 2; it is aspected by Mars
owning 4 and occupying 6). So Venus is the strong significator of 3, 8, 11 and
connected with 2, 4, 6, 7, 11 and Mars. Hence the cuspal sub lord of 2 promises
an unexpected gain of money by way of bargain in connection with the building.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.11_Purchasing the Building_3"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) In this map the native was born during
the period of Saturn with balance of 0Y 7M 12D. The sign lord, star lord and
sub lord of the 2nd cusp (i.e. Mercury, Sun and Venus respectively) all these
three are the significators of 2, 4 and 11. Among them Sun is the strongest
significator of 2, 4, 11 and connected with 12; and its period starts from
21-7-1967 and continues upto 21-7-1973.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) So during the period of Sun he will
gain money in connection with the building, he will take a loan from the Bank
and he will have his own building. This will happen during the joint period of
Sun and Mercury: and Sun and Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) In fact, during the joint period of
Sun, Mercury and Moon in October 1971; and during the period of Sun and Venus
in 1972 he got more than one lac of rupees in all from his land lord for
vacating the building in which he resided as a tenant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) He could purchase a new building with
this money during the same joint period of Sun and Venus in 1972. He occupied
the building in October 1972 during the joint period of Sun, Venus and Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) He also received a loan from the Bank
in connection with this building during the joint period of Sun, Venus and
Mercury in June 1973.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Occupation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this map the sub lord of the 10th cusp
is Mars (printing). Its star lord (Mars) is aspected by Jupiter (publications):
and Mars occupies the 6th and aspects the 2nd &amp; the 10th cusps (the houses
of occupation). Its sub lord Sun (the chief governor of occupation) is in conj.
with Mercury (paper) the owner of 2 in Scorpio (owned by Mars). So the sub lord
of the 10th cusp is closely connected with Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and also the
houses of occupation. Hence this native is a printer and he runs his own printing
press.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.10_Partnership Business.html">← Partnership Business</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.11_Purchasing the Building">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.12_Mystery of 6_ 8 and 12.html">Mystery of 6_ 8 and 12 →</a></div></body>
