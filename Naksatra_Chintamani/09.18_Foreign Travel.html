2-42 P.M. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="602" src="img/image110.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="98" src="img/image111.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.18_Foreign Travel_1"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map Moon is in the star
Venus owning 12 and occupying 6. It is in the sub Jupiter owning 10. So it is
the significator of 6 (employment), 12 (stay in foreign land) and connected
with 10 (prospects). Thus Moon indicates that the querent desires to go abroad
for better prospects in employment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th Cusp. The sub lord of the 12th cusp is
Rahu. It is in the star Ketu in 12 (being in conj. represents Saturn owning 9)
and in its own sub (Rahu) in 6. So it is the significator of 9, 12 and
connected with 6. Hence Rahu promises going abroad and staying there for a job.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th Cusp. The sub lord of the 11th cusp is
Jupiter. It is in the star Moon owning 2 and occupying 11. (Moon being aspected
by Sun owning 3 is connected with 3). It is in the sub Mars owning 6, 11 and
occupying 10. So it is the significator of 2, 11 and connected with 3, 6, 10
and 11. Hence Jupiter promises the fulfilment of the querent's desire for
financial prospects in foreign land.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.18_Foreign Travel_2"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Venus Dasha
balance 7Y 9M 0D) the querent is running the joint period of Venus and Jupiter
which continues upto 10-6-1974.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Venus (the period ruler) is the sub
lord of the 9th cusp (foreign travel). It is in the star Ketu in 12
(representing Saturn owning 9). It is in the sub Mercury; the sub lord Mercury
is in conj. with Sun owning 3, and aspected by Moon owning 2 and by Mars owning
6 and 11. so Mercury is connected with 2, 3, 6 and 11. Thus Venus is the
significator of 9, 12 and connected with 2, 3, 6 and 11. So the period of Venus
is favourable for foreign travel and financial prospects.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But Venus is in the sub of retrograde
Mercury, Mercury gets direct in motion on 17</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 15</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Libra from 20-11-1973 and it crosses the original point of
retrogradation (i. e. Scorpio 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 13</span>′<span lang="EN-US">) on 6-12-1973. So after this date Venus will begin to manifest its
favourable influence.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The sub period ruler Jupiter as
discussed above is favourable for fulfilling the querent's desire before
10-6-1974.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now Jupiter is in the sub of retrograde
Mars; Mars gets direct in motion on 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 55</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Aries from 26-11-1973 and it crosses the original point of
retrogradation (i. e. Aries 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 53</span>′<span lang="EN-US">) on 18-1-1974. So the querent will be able to go abroad between
18-1-1974 and 10-6-1974.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) During this time the inter period of
Rahu will be in progress (16-1-1974 to 10-6-1974). Rahu as already discussed
will be most congenial for foreign travel and stay at abroad when the transit
agrees.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) In this case Venus (the cuspal sub lord
of 9), Jupiter (the cuspal sub lord of 11) and Rahu (the cuspal sub lord of 12)
are the significators of and connected with foreign travel and financial
prospects. So their joint period is fruitful for foreign travel. Moreover, the
querent is running the joint period of the same planets viz. Venus and Jupiter
at the time of judgment.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.18_Foreign Travel_3"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu in transit will move from 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Sagittarius to 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 3</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> Scorpio between 16-1-1974 and 10-6-1974,
and it will pass through the sub of Jupiter between 7-5-1974 and 9-6-1974.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter in transit will move from 18</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 55</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> to 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 16</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in Aquarius between 7-5-1974 and 9-6-1974, and it will pass through
the stars of Rahu and Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the querent will go to Chicago during
this time, in the joint period of Venus, Jupiter and Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Actually he started for Chicago on 8-6-1974
at 1-30 A. M. I. S. T. by aeroplane. At that time Sun was transitting in Taurus
