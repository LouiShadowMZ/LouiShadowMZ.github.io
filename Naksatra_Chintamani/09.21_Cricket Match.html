Cricket Test Match against West Indies which is being played at Bangalore in
India? (Query on behalf of India).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 65 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment. 22-11-1974, Friday; 12-35

two rival parties in any walk of life viz. cricket match etc., if the cuspal
sub lord of the 11th (success) and that of the 6th (defeat to the rival) occupy
the house 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 or 11 and be in the star of the occupant of the house
1, 2, 3, 6, 10 or 11 the team under query will win the cricket match.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.21_Cricket Match_2"><span lang="EN-US">West Indies Cricket Team</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp XI. The sub lord of XI cusp is Sun. It
occupies XI. It is in the star Saturn the occupant of VI; and it is in the sub
Mercury the occupant of X. So it is the significator of VI and connected with X
and XI. Hence it is favourable to the West Indies Team.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp VI. The sub lord of VI cusp is Mercury
the occupant of X. It is in the star and sub Jupiter the occupant of II. So it
is the significator of II and connected with X. Hence it is advantageous to the
West Indies Team.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.21_Cricket Match_3"><span lang="EN-US">Indian Cricket Team</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th Cusp. The sub lord of the 11th cusp is
Mars. It occupies the 4th. It is in the star Jupiter the occupant of the 8th
and it is in the sub Saturn the occupant of the 12th. So it is the significator
of 8 and connected with 4 and 12. Thus it is unfavourable to the Indian Team.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6th Cusp. The sub lord of the 6th cusp is
Venus the occupant of the 5th. It is in the star Saturn the occupant of the
12th and it is in its own sub. So it is the significator of 12 and connected
with 5. Thus it is disadvantageous to the Indian Team.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In view of the above position the West
Indies Cricket Team will win the 1st Cricket Test Match against the Indian
Cricket Team. In fact the West Indies Cricket Team won the match which was
being played at Bangalore in India. from 22-11-1974 to 27-11-1974.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.21_Cricket Match_4"><span lang="EN-US">Note</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this case Sun (the cuspal sub lord of
XI) is in the star of retrograde Saturn. But Sun is the significator of VI the
house under consideration. So the point of retrogradation does not come in the
way of promising the matter signified by VI.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.20_Lost Documents.html">← Lost Documents</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.21_Cricket Match">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.22_Pregnancy.html">Pregnancy →</a></div></body>
