be the significator of 2, 6 or 10 service or earning is promised during the
joint period of the significators of 2, 6 and 10.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.13_Employment_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map Moon is aspected by the
occupants of the 2nd (Sun and Mars) and the owner of the 6th (Sun). Thus Moon
clearly indicates that the query refers to service or job for money.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.13_Employment_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cusps 2, 6 &amp; 10th. The sub lord of the
2nd, 6th and 10th cusps is Mercury. It is direct in motion. Its star lord Venus
owning 2 is also direct in motion. So Mercury is the significator of 2. Hence
service will be promised soon to the querent because Mercury is a fast moving
planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp 11th The sub lord of the 11th cusp is
Venus. It is direct in motion. Its star lord Mars the occupant of the 2nd is
also direct. So Venus is the significator of 2. Hence the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s desire will be fulfilled soon because Venus is a fast moving
planet.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.13_Employment_4"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="111" src="img/image097.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">None of them is in the star or sub of a
retrograde planet. Mars aspects Ketu, so Ketu represents Mars. Thus the ruling
planets are Mercury, Venus and Ketu.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.13_Employment_5"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of 2_ 6 and 10</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="163" src="img/image098.jpg" width="553"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu in Leo represents Sun, so take Ketu in
stead of Sun.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The common planets between the ruling
planets and the significators are Mercury, Venus and Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this case Ketu is a significator and is
only considered as a ruling planet (representing Mars); while Mercury and Venus
are the significators, the ruling planets and also the cuspal sub lords of the
houses 2, 6, 10 and 11. So Mercury and Venus may be considered as the final
significators.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.13_Employment_6"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Mercury Dasha
balance 13Y 8M 7D) the querent is running the joint period of Mercury and Ketu.
The sub period of Venus will commence from 23-6-1970.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the querent will get service during the
joint period of Mercury, Venus, Venus and Venus at the earliest i.e. between
23-6-1970 and 21-7-1970. The reason is that both are connected with the 2nd,
6th, 10th and 11th cusps; both are the ruling planets and both are fast moving
planets.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.13_Employment_7"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent got his first service on
