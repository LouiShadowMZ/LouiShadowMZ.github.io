3-11-1974. She is missing since then. Is she alive or dead. When shall I get
the news about her?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 185 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2', 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35'</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment. 8-11-1974, Friday; 4-0

significator (i. e. in the star of the occupant or owner) of 3 and 11 the
querent will hear the news.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent will hear the news when the
transitting Moon passes over the same degrees as that of the significators of 3
and 11; also when Moon transits the same degrees as that of the significator of
the 3rd house of the missing person.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.6_News About The Missing Wife_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map the husband put the
query about his wife. So consider the 7th cusp as the Asc. for the wife and
proceed. For convenience the roman letter is given to each house counted from
the 7th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is aspected by Jupiter from VIII. Its
sub lord Saturn which owns VIII (life) is in XII (missing) and on the cusp of
the wife</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Asc. Thus it clearly shows that the query is
about the wife who is missing and it is about her life.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.6_News About The Missing Wife_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sublord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Wife</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Asc. The
cuspal sub lord of the wife</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Asc. is Venus. It is in
the star Jupiter owning VII. So it is the significator both of the badhaka and
maraka house. This means that the wife of the querent is dead.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s 3rd cusp.
The cuspal sub lord of the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s 3rd house is
Venus. It is in the star Jupiter owning 3. So it is the significator of 3.
Further, this star lord Jupiter aspects the owner of 11 (Mars) and the cuspal
sub lord Venus is in conj. with the owner of 11 (Mars). Thus the cuspal sub
lord of the 3rd house Venus is connected also with the house 11. Hence the
querent will hear the news about his wife.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.6_News About The Missing Wife_4"><span lang="EN-US">Querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Significators of 3 and
11</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun, Venus and Saturn (being in the star
Jupiter owning 3) are the significators of 3.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars and Jupiter (being in the star Rahu in
11) are the significators of 11.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.6_News About The Missing Wife_5"><span lang="EN-US">Wife</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Significator of III</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu (being in the star Mercury owning and
occupying III) is the significator of III.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.6_News About The Missing Wife_6"><span lang="EN-US">Transit of Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent will hear the news that his
wife is dead when the transitting Moon passes over the same degress as that of
Mars, Sun and Venus on 13-11-1974 or on 15-11-1974 when Moon passes over the
same degrees as that of Rahu which is in the 11th house of the querent. On
15-11-1974 the querent got the news that his wife was dead.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.5_Disease.html">← Disease</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.6_News About The Missing Wife">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.7_Publication of a Book.html">Publication of a Book →</a></div></body>
