have lost them at any place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 210 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35</span>′</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment. 4-6-1973, Monday; 10-35
A.M. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="580" src="img/image114.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="85" src="img/image115.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.20_Lost Documents_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of 2 or 11 be the
significator of 2 (movable article which is lost or stolen), 6 (loss to the
thief, being 12 to the 7th-thief) or 11 (regaining), movable property will be
regained during the joint period of the significators of 2, 6 and 11.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.20_Lost Documents_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map Moon is in the star
Jupiter in 12 owning 2 and 11. So Moon is the significator of 12 (loss), 2
(lost thing) and 11 (regain). Thus it clearly indicates that the query refers
to the loss of documents and their regaining.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.20_Lost Documents_3"><span lang="EN-US">11th cusp</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 11th cusp is jointly ruled by Jupiter
(sign lord), Ketu (star lord) and Rahu (sub lord). Jupiter is in the 12th, the
12th house denotes losing or passing away of a thing. But as Jupiter in the
12th is retrograde, it indicates that the thing cannot be lost.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter is in the star Moon owning and
occupying 6; it is in the sub Mercury the significator of 11 (being in the star
Rahu in 11). So Jupiter is the significator of 6 and connected with 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu is in the star Rahu in 11; it is in
the sub Venus which aspects the 11th cusp. So Ketu is the significator of 11
and connected with 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu is in 11, it is in the star Venus
which aspects the 11th cusp; it is in the sub Sun the significator of 6 (being
in the star Moon in 6). So Rahu is the significator of 11 and connected with 6
and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus the cuspal joint rulers of the 11th
are the significators of 6 and 11. So the lost documents will be regained.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.20_Lost Documents_4"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="95" src="img/image116.jpg" width="553"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is in the star of retrograde Jupiter.
So it may be omitted. Ketu in Gemini represents Mercury; and Rahu in
Sagittarius represents Jupiter. Hence the ruling planets are Mercury, Jupiter,
Rahu and Ketu.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.20_Lost Documents_5"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Jupiter Dasha
balance 0Y 11M 16D) the querent is running the joint period of Jupiter, Rahu
and Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All these three planets are among the
ruling planets. They are the cuspal joint rulers of the 11th house. They are
the significators of 6 and 11. So the querent will receive back his lost
documents during their joint period which lasts upto 1-7-1973.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.20_Lost Documents_6"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The inter period ruler Ketu will be
transitting in Gemini from 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US">13</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> to 14</span>°<span lang="EN-US">27</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in its
own sub Ketu from 13-6-1973 upto 27-6-1973. So the querent will regain his
documents by this time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was learnt from the querent that he
received back his documents on 20-6-1973 at 2-20 P. M. I. S. T. from the host
of the place where he forgot them. At that time Moon was transitting in
Capricorn 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US">1</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the sub Rahu
(the sub period ruler).</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.19_Return of Absconding Son.html">← Return of Absconding Son</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.20_Lost Documents">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.21_Cricket Match.html">Cricket Match →</a></div></body>
