Mercury governs the nervous system.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Consider the houses 2 (vision, right
eye), 12 (left eye: defect), 6 (disease) and 8 (danger).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. 12th cusp. If the sub lord of the 12th
cusp be the significator of 6, 8 or 12, then only during the joint period of
the significators of 2 and 12 the eye sight becomes defective.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. If Sun, Moon or Venus be:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) the sub lord of the 12th cusp and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) the significator of 2 or 12</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">there is a greater possibility of defective
vision.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Eye sight may be lost during the periods
of Sun, Moon or Venus if:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Sun, Moon or Venus be the significator
of 2 or 12, and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) its sub lord is the occupant or owner
of 12, and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) its sub lord is connected with Sun,
Moon or Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Eye sight may be lost during the periods
of a planet A if:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) its star lord be Sun, Moon or Venus,
and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) its sub lord is the occupant or owner
of 12, and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) its sub lord is connected with Sun,
Moon or Venus.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.3_Eye Sight_2"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th Cusp. The sub lord of the 12th cusp is
Rahu. Its star lord Ketu is in 6, it being aspected represents Sun, Moon and
Mercury which are in 12. So Rahu is the significator of 6 and 12.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.3_Eye Sight_3"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of 2 and 12</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All planets except Venus are the
significators of 2 or 12. So select the significators which are in the sub of
the occupant or owner of 2 or 12. Thus Moon (in its own sub in 12), Mercury (in
the sub Saturn owning 2), Rahu (in the sub Jupiter owning 12) and Ketu (in the
sub Rahu in 12) may be considered as the final significators of 2 and 12.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.3_Eye Sight_4"><span lang="EN-US">Joint period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. As the cuspal sub lord of 12 (Rahu) is
the significator of 6 and 12, the joint period of the significators of 2 and 12
(Moon, Rahu, Mercury and Ketu) will cause defect in eye sight or vision.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. The native was born during the period of
Venus with 14Y 2M 12D in balance.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During the period of Moon (24-3-1938 to
24-3-1948), in the sub periods of Rahu (24-8-1939 to 24-2-1941), Mercury
(24-1-1944 to 24-6-1945) and Ketu (24-6-1945 to 24-1-1946) his eye sight was
gradually getting weaker.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The period ruler Moon is the cuspal sub
lord of 11 (cure) and it is also the significator of 1 and 5 (being in the star
Venus in 1 and owning 5). This denotes remedial measures and hence his eye
sight did not become worse during the period of Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3 (a) During the period of Rahu (24-3-1955
to 24-3-1973), in the sub periods of Rahu (24-3-1955 to 6-12-1957), Mercury
(6-3-1963 to 27-9-1965), Ketu (24-9-1965 to 12-10-1966) and Moon (6-9-1970 to
6-3-1972) he was gradually losing his vision.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The period ruler Rahu is the cuspal sub
lord of 12 and it is the significator of 6 and 12. This denotes disease and
defect in vision and hence this is a very bad period for eyesight.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) Moon is the significator of 12, its
star lord is Venus, its sublord is the occupant of 12 and connected with Moon.
So the sub period of Moon will prove dangerous for vision.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence during the joint period of Rahu and
Moon he lost vision in the year 1971, due to detachment of Retina.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) 11th Cusp (cure). Moon is the cuspal
sublord of 11 and it is the significator of 1 and 5. So it denotes remedial
measures for improving the Retinal detachment. Hence in this very sub period of
Moon he will get treatment for regaining vision. Moon is in its own Sub and it
is aspected by Mars (operation) owning 11 (remedy) and occupying 8 (surgery).
So his eyes will be operated and he will get vision.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) The period ruler Rahu is in the sub
Jupiter which owns 12 and aspects Mars. Hence Rahu indicates hospitalisation
and surgical operation for curing eyesight. His eyes were operated thrice during
the joint period of Rahu and Moon on 28-1-1971, 4-8-1971 and 2-2-1972. He
regained a slight vision in one eye, the other eye is without vision because of
the Cataract.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4 (a) 8th Cusp (danger). The sublord of the
8th cusp is Jupiter. It owns 12, it is in the Star Sun owing 8 and occupying
12, it is in the Sub Venus owing 5 and occupying 1. So it is the significator
of 8, 12 and connected with 1 and 5. Hence Jupiter shows danger, defect and
cure. Further its starlord Sun is aspected by Mars owning 11 and occupying 8;
while its sublord Venus is in the Star Mars. So Jupiter also denotes operation
and cure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) In view of this he will lose eyesight
during the joint period of Rahu, Moon and Jupiter (13-2-1971 to 25-4-1971). He
lost vision on 10-4-1971 when Sun was transitting in Pisces 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 8</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the Sub Jupiter (the inter period
ruler); Moon in Virgo 17</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 0</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in
its own Star (the sub period ruler); Rahu in Capricorn 27</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 22</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the Sub Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. His eye was operated during the joint
period of Rahu, Moon and Saturn on 28-4-1971. Saturn owns 2 (vision), it is in
the Star Mercury (nerves i.e. Retina) owning 6 (disease) and occupying 12
(hospitalisation), it is in the Sub Venus owning 5 and occupying 1 (cure), So
Saturn is the significator of 6, 12 and connected with 2; 1 and 5. Further its
starlord Mercury is aspected by Mars and its sublord Venus is in the Star Mars.
Hence Saturn shows Retinal operation for cure.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.3_Eye Sight_5"><span lang="EN-US">Transit.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On 28-4-1971 Sun was transitting in Aries
(eyes), the sign of Mars (operation), in the Star of Venus (vision); Moon in
Taurus 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in the Star of Moon (the sub period ruler);
Saturn in Taurus 0</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 5</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the
Sub Rahu (the period ruler).</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.2_Longevity.html">← Longevity</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.3_Eye Sight">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.4_Attempt to Commit Suicide.html">Attempt to Commit Suicide →</a></div></body>
