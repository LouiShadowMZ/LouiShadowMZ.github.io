Scorpio or Pisces and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) is the significator of 2, 5 or 11 the

Leo or Virgo and</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) is in the star of the planet in the
barren sign, then the woman concerned is not pregnant.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.22_Pregnancy_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent put the query for his uncle's
(his father's younger brother's) daughter. The 9th house denotes the querent's
father, the 11th his uncle; so the 3rd house becomes the Asc. of the cousin
sister. For convenience the roman letter is given to each house counted from
the 3rd cusp, so proceed accordingly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map Moon is in conj. with
Saturn owning V (pregnancy to the sister). Thus it clearly shows that the query
refers to the pregnancy of the sister.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.22_Pregnancy_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp V. The sub lord of V cusp is Ketu. It
is in its own star (Ketu) which is in the barren sign Leo in X. So Ketu is the
Significator of X. Ketu as the sub lord of V cusp and as its own star lord is
in the barren sign. Moreover Ketu itself is not favourable for conception.
Hence the querent's cousin sister is not pregnant at the time of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In females Moon denotes fertility. In this
case Moon is in conj. with Saturn the obstructor in the barren sign Aries. So
the querent's cousin sister is not pregnant at the time of judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Later on, in the medical examination it was
revealed that she was not pregnant.</span></p>
