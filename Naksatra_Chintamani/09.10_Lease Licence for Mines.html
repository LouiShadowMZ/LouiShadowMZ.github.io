<body><h2 id="heading_09.10_Lease Licence for Mines_0"><span lang="EN-US">Lease Licence for Mines</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Question. When shall I get the lease
licence for mines from the State Govt. ?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 86 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment. 13-8-1973, Monday; 8-10
p.m. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="638" src="img/image087.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="129" src="img/image088.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.10_Lease Licence for Mines_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The house 6 denotes a tenant or lessee; the
12th shows parting with the possession of land or building or mines and the
11th indicates success or fulfilment of desire or gain. So for getting the
lease of mines from the other person, consider the house 11 from the Asc.; and
6 and 12 as counted from the 7th (the other person's Asc).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of the Asc. and/or
the 11th is the significator of 6, 11 or 12, you can become a lessee during the
joint period of the significators of 6, 11 and 12.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.10_Lease Licence for Mines_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map Moon is in its own star
owning 12 (6th from 7 i.e. lessee) and occupying 6 (12th from 7 i.e. parting
with the possession of mines by Govt.), it is aspected by the owner of 11
(Mercury). So Moon is the significator of 12, 6 and 11. Thus it indicates that
the querent desires to become the lessee to Govt.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.10_Lease Licence for Mines_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Asc. The sub lord of the Asc. is Sun, it
occupies 12. It is in the star Mercury owning 11 and occupying 12; it is in the
sub Jupiter in 6. So Sun is the significator of 11, 12 and connected with 6 and
12. Its sub lord Jupiter in 6 denotes parting with the possession of mines by
Govt. But it is retrograde, so the lease licence from Govt. will be promised
only when Jupiter becomes direct in motion i.e. after 29-9-1973.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th cusp. The cuspal sub lord of the 11th
is Venus. It is in the star Sun which is in conj. with the owner of 11
(Mercury) in the 12th. It is in the sub Rahu (being aspected represents Saturn
in 11 and owning 6). So Venus is the significator of 11, 12 and connected with
11 and 6. Hence the querent will surely get the lease licence of mines from
Govt.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.10_Lease Licence for Mines_4"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="87" src="img/image089.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">None of them is in the star or sub of a
retrograde planet. So the ruling planets are Moon, Saturn and Rahu. Saturn is
in the star and sub of the ruling planet (Rahu), so Saturn gets stronger than
Rahu. Moon and Saturn are the significators of 6 and 11.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.10_Lease Licence for Mines_5"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Moon Dasha balance
1Y 1M 19D) the querent is running the joint period of Moon, Venus and Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The period ruler Moon is among the ruling
planets and it is the significator of 6, 11 and 12 as previously discussed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub period ruler Venus is the cuspal
sub lord of 11 and it is also the significator of 6, 11 and 12. as discussed
earlier.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the joint period of Moon and Venus is to
be considered as favourable for getting the lease licence.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The inter period ruler Jupiter is
retrograde and as discussed earlier we have to omit Jupiter. The next after
Jupiter the inter period of Saturn will start from 27-8-1973 and will continue
upto 2-12-1973. Saturn is among the ruling planets and it is also the
significator of 6 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence during the joint period of Moon,
Venus and Saturn the querent will get the lease licence after 29-9-1973 when
the transit agrees.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.10_Lease Licence for Mines_6"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun will transit in Virgo from 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in the star Moon (the period ruler)
from 29-9-1973 to 11-10-1973; Venus will be in Scorpio 4</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to 9</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in the star Saturn (the inter period
ruler); and Saturn in Gemini 11</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> to 11</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in its own sub Saturn. So the querent
will get the lease licence before 11-10-1973.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was learnt from the querent that he
could secure the lease licence of mines from Govt. before 11-10-1973. No exact
date was mentioned in the letter by the querent.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.9_Selling The House.html">← Selling The House</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.10_Lease Licence for Mines">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.11_Success in Examination.html">Success in Examination →</a></div></body>
