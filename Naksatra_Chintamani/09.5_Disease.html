<body><h2 id="heading_09.5_Disease_0"><span lang="EN-US">Disease</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Question. I am bed ridden since long, when
will there be an end to my disease?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 90 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2', 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35'</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment.17-5-1971, Monday, 8-30-0
P.M. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="475" src="img/image072.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="118" src="img/image073.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.5_Disease_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of the 6th be the
significator of 5 or 11 the disease is cured during the joint period of the
significators of 5 and 11.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.5_Disease_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map Moon occupies the 6th.
It is in the star Mars owning the badhaka house 9 and occupying 6; it is in the
sub Saturn owning 6 and 7. So Moon is the significator of 6 (sickness,
disease), 9 (danger to life) and connected with 6 and 7 (maraka). Thus Moon
indicates that the query refers to the serious sickness or disease.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.5_Disease_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6th cusp. The sub lord of the 6th cusp is
Venus. It occupies the badhaka house 9. It is in the star Ketu in 12 and in the
sub Mars owning 9 and occupying 6. So Venus is the significator of 12 and
connected with 6 and 9. It is not the significator of 5 or 11. Hence the cure
of the disease is not promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th cusp. The sub lord of the 11th cusp is
Rahu. It occupies 6. It is in the star Mars owning 9 and occupying 6. It is in
its own sub in 6. So Rahu is the significator of 6, 9 and connected with 6. It
is not the significator of 5 or 11. Hence the disease will not be cured.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.5_Disease_4"><span lang="EN-US">Disease</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6th cusp. The cuspal sub lord of 6 is
Venus. Venus occupies the movable sign Aries. Its star lord Ketu also occupies
the movable sign Cancer. The movable sign governs head; stomach; kidney, skin
and the functional system of the body. So these parts of the body will be
affected by the disease.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The cuspal sub lord of 6 (Venus) is in
conj. with Mercury; so the disease will be of the complicated nature. It is
aspected by Mars; so the disease will be acute, inflammatory and painful.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Venus's star lord Ketu is aspected by
Saturn; so the disease will be chronic in its nature. It is also aspected by
Mars; so there will be painful, acute, sudden and inflammatory diseases.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this case the querent girl was suffering
from many diseases viz. kidney was not functioning, the whole body was getting
swelled and so on. Even the expert Doctors could not diagnose the disease.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.5_Disease_5"><span lang="EN-US">Longevity</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Asc. The sub lord of the Asc. is Jupiter.
It is retrograde and owns the 8th. It is in the star Saturn owning the maraka
house 7 and occupying the badhaka house 9. It is in the sub Venus in 9. So
Jupiter is the significator of the badhaka and maraka house and connected with
the 8th and the badhaka house 9. Hence the cuspal sub lord of the Asc. denotes
short life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now we may examine the strength of the star
lord and the sub lord of Jupiter. The star lord Saturn is aspected by the owner
of the 8th (Jupiter); it is the significator of the badhaka house 9; so it
becomes evil for longevity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub lord Venus is aspected by the owner
of the badhaka house 9 (Mars); it is the significator of the maraka house 12;
so it also becomes evil for longevity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Both the star lord and the sub lord of
Jupiter are evil, so it is natural that the cuspal sub lord of the Asc.
(Jupiter) becomes evil for longevity. Thus the life of the querent is too
short.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.5_Disease_6"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="138" src="img/image074.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu in Capricorn and in conj. with Moon
and Mars represents Saturn, Moon and Mars respectively. Ketu being aspected by
Moon and Mars represents them both. Saturn being in the sub of retrograde
Jupiter may be omitted. Thus the ruling planets are Moon, Mars, Mercury, Rahu
and Ketu.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.5_Disease_7"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of Death</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="242" src="img/image075.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The common planets between the ruling
planets and the significators are Moon, Mars, Mercury, Rahu and Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Out of them Mars is in the sub of the
ruling planet Rahu; and Mercury is in the star and sub of the ruling planets
viz. Ketu and Rahu respectively. So Mars and Mercury are to be given preference
over other significators and they should be considered as the final
significators for death.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.5_Disease_8"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Mars Dasha balance
3Y 6M 22D) the querent is running the joint period of Mars and Saturn which
expires on 9-6-1971.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As discussed above the joint period of
Mars, Mercury and Mercury (9-6-1971 to 29-7-1971) will prove fatal to the life
of the querent when the transit agrees.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.5_Disease_9"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun will be transitting in Taurus 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">11</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> to Gemini 6</span>°<span lang="EN-US">39</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the star Mars (the period ruler) from 9-6-1971 to 22-6-1971 and
Mars will transit in Capricorn 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> and forward in its own star (Mars) from 11-6-1971, so the querent
will not survive this period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent girl died on 14-6-1971 Monday
at 1-0 A.M. I.S.T. At that time Sun was in Taurus 28</span>°<span lang="EN-US">47</span>′<span lang="EN-US">; Moon in Capricorn 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US">23</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> and Mars in Capricorn 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">11</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, all these three were in the star Mars (the period ruler). Mercury
was in Taurus 19</span>°<span lang="EN-US">36</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in its own
sub Mercury (the sub and inter period ruler).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It may be noted that in this horary map
Pisces is on the cusp of the 8th; while at the time of death the Asc. was also
in Pisces 2</span>°<span lang="EN-US">28</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment Moon was in
Capricorn 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US">53</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> and at the
time of death also Moon was in Capricorn 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US">23</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.4_Longevity.html">← Longevity</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.5_Disease">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.6_News About The Missing Wife.html">News About The Missing Wife →</a></div></body>
