<body><h2 id="heading_08.9_From Bar to Judiciary_0"><span lang="EN-US">From Bar to Judiciary</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Male. Birth 6-12-1931 Sunday; 10.55 A.M.
I.S.T.; 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2', 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35;

cusp is the significator of 2, 7 or 10, an independent profession is promised
during the joint period of the significators of 2, 7 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this map the cuspal sub lord of 10 is
Venus. It is in the star Ketu which represents Sun in 10 (Ketu being in the
star Sun). It is in the sub Mercury in 11. So Venus is the significator of 10
and connected with 11. Hence it promises an independant profession during the
joint period of the significators of 2, 7 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The 10th cusp is jointly operated by
Venus (sign lord), Jupiter (star lord) and Venus (sub lord). The profession in
this case will be shown by the combination of Jupiter and Venus. Jupiter
denotes legal profession; while Venus deals with the function of a Judge who
harmonises law. Hence the native may practise as a Lawyer or serve as a Judge.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.9_From Bar to Judiciary_2"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) This native was born during the period
of Rahu with balance of 17Y 6M 10P. The period of Jupiter was current from
16-6-1949 upto 16-6-1965.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) He completed his studies in Law in the
month of February 1953 during the joint period of Jupiter, Saturn and Moon the
significators of 3 and 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) He started his career as a Lawyer in
the month of June 1953 during the joint period of Jupiter, Saturn and Rahu the
significators of 2, 10 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The period ruler Jupiter governs law and
dignity. It does not like subordination. So it denotes an independent practice
as a Lawyer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter owns 3, so the intellectual
abilities of the native will serve as the source. Its star lord Mercury in 11
is in association with Mars owning 11, Venus owning 10 and Saturn owning 2. Its
sub lord Saturn owns 2. So Jupiter is the significator of 2, 10 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) The influence of the sub periods is to
be interpreted in concurrence with the influence of the period ruler. In this
case the sub period ruler Saturn and the inter period ruler Rahu both are in
harmony with Jupiter the period ruler. Further, the next following sub period
rulers current during the period of Jupiter concur with Jupiter, because they
all are connected with 2, 10 or 11. Hence he successfully practised as a Lawyer
throughout the period of Jupiter upto 16-6-1965.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(e) The period of Saturn started from
16-6-1965. The houses 1, 5 and 9 denote any sort of change in the professional
activities. Saturn owns 1 (change) and 2 (income); so the change in income will
be the source. It is in the star Sun (Govt.) in 10 (professional activities).
It is in the sub Moon owning 7 (contract or dealings with Govt.) and occupying
9 (change in the existing set up of activities). So Saturn is the significator
of 10 and connected with 7, 9; 1 and 2. Thus Saturn indicates that the professional
activities of the native will be connected with Govt. by way of contractual
dealings and he will derive income thereby. This amounts to entering into a new
sphere.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(f) Further, Saturn denotes permanency,
steadiness, responsibilities and inclination for service.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So during the joint period of Saturn,
Saturn and Saturn in the month of October 1965, the native was appointed as a
Special Govt. Pleader in addition to his private practice. Thus Saturn effected
a change in the professional activities of the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(g) Now in the period of Saturn the sub
period of Mercury will be in progress from 19-6-1968 upto 28-2-1971. Mercury
owns 6 (service) and 9 (change). So another change in the professional
activities and the form of service will become the cause of an event in the
life of the native. It is in the star Ketu (being in the star Sun) representing
Sun in 10 (Govt). It is in the sub Saturn owning 1 and 2. So Mercury is the
significator of 10 (position &amp; power) and connected with 1 (change), 2
(income), 6 (service) and 9 (change).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The influence of the sub period ruler
Mercury is to be construed in concurrence with the influence of the period
ruler Saturn as discussed above. So Saturn and Mercury both indicate service,
position, power, relations with Govt. and income thereby. Hence it may be
inferred that the native might accept a post in Govt service carrying position
and power during the sub period of Mercury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(h) Mercury is controlled by its sub lord
Saturn which is both the period ruler and also the cuspal sub lord of 2
(income), 3 and 9 (change). So the joint period of Saturn, Mercury and Saturn
(25-9-1970 to 28-2-1971) indicates that the native will give up the independent
practice as a Lawyer and he will join Govt. service.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(i) In fact he was offered the post of a
Judge in the Small Causes Court during this time. He accepted it and he took
charge of the post on 19-12-1970 during the joint period of Saturn, Mercury,
Saturn and Sun. Sun is in 10 (Govt., position, power); it is in the star
Mercury owning 6, 9 and occupying 11; it is in the sub Venus owning 5, 10 and
occupying 11. The star lord Mercury is in association with Saturn owning 1, 2;
Mars owning 11 and Venus. So Sun is the significator of 6 (service), 9 (change
from a Lawyer to a Judge), 11 (success, prospects) and connected with 5 (change
in activities), 10 (position, power); 1 (change of profession) and 2 (income
from Govt.). Thus the native ceased to be a Lawyer and became a Judge in Govt.
judicial service.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.9_From Bar to Judiciary_3"><span lang="EN-US">Transit.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On 19-12-1970 Sun was transitting in
