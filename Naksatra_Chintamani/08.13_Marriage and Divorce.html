The sub lord of the
7th cusp is Saturn. It is in the star Sun owning 11 and occupying 6. It is in
the sub Saturn owning 5 and occupying 11. So Saturn is the significator of 11
(permanent friendship), 6 (separation) and connected with 5 (love affair) and
11. Hence the cuspal sub lord of the 7th (Saturn) promises marriage but denotes
separation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th cusp (Permanent relationship). The sub
lord of the 11th cusp is Sun. It is in the star Venus owning 1 and 8 and
occupying 8. It is in the sub Moon owning 10. So Sun is the significator of 1
(separation), 8 (disappointment) and connected with 10 (separation). Hence the
cuspal sub lord of the 11th (Sun) denotes disappointment and separation in
married life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5th cusp (Love affair). The sub lord of the
5th cusp is Venus. It is in the star Mars owning 2, 7 and occupying 6. It is in
the sub Rahu representing Moon (being in conj.) owning 10 and occupying 4. So
Venus is the significator of 2, 7 (marriage), 6 (separation) and connected with
4 (disappointment in love-it being 12 to 5) and 10 (separation). Hence the
cuspal sub lord of the 5th (Venus) denotes choice marriage but indicates
disappointment and separation in married life.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.13_Marriage and Divorce_2"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of Marriage</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="119" src="img/image060.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are the
strong significators of marriage. Hence marriage will take place during their
joint period.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.13_Marriage and Divorce_3"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The native was born during the period of
Rahu with balance of 10Y 4M 6D. The period of Jupiter starts from 6-9-1961.
Jupiter is aspected by Saturn a natural malefic which causes delay. So there is
no possibility of marriage during the joint period of Jupiter and Saturn. Hence
marriage will take place during the joint period of Jupiter, Venus and Saturn
which will commence from 4-4-1971 and will continue upto 6-9-1971. The native
will get married when the transit agrees with the joint period ruler or rulers within
this time.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.13_Marriage and Divorce_4"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun will transit in the star Venus in Aries
from 28-4-1971 upto 12-5-1971. This is a favourable period for marriage.
Actually marriage took place on 3-5-1971 when Sun was in Aries 19</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 0' in the star Venus (the sub period ruler); Jupiter in Scorpio 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 42'R in the star Saturn (the inter period ruler).</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.13_Marriage and Divorce_5"><span lang="EN-US">Separation</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are both the
significators of marriage (2, 7 and 11) and separation or divorce (1, 6 and
10). Venus and Saturn have been discussed earlier; while Jupiter owns 6, it is
in the sub Venus owning 1 and so it is the significator of 1 and 6.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The cuspal sub lords of the 7th and
11th denote separation in married life. So during the joint period of the
significators of 1, 6 and 10 (Jupiter, Venus and Saturn the same planets and
during the same time from 4-4-1971 to 6-9-1971 as previously discussed), the
husband suspected the character of the native; and she was asked to leave the
house of the husband on 15-7-1971 and to have her own way. Hence separation in
married life.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.13_Marriage and Divorce_6"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On that day Sun was transitting in Gemini

(the significator of 6 and 10; its star lord Rahu in conj. with Moon owning 10
and its sub lord Saturn the significator of 6) in the year 1973, separation
resulted into divorce.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="08.12_Mystery of 6_ 8 and 12.html">← Mystery of 6_ 8 and 12</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_08.13_Marriage and Divorce">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="08.14_Foreign Travel.html">Foreign Travel →</a></div></body>
