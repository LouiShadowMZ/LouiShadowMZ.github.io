<h1 id="heading_07_Transit in Nakshatra or Star_0"><span lang="EN-US">III Planets in Transit</span></h1><h2 id="heading_07_Transit in Nakshatra or Star_1"><span lang="EN-US">Transit in Nakshatra or Star</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The slow moving planets in transit denote
the period in general e.g. Saturn takes about 13 months in one Nakshatra or
Constellation or Star; Rahu or Ketu 8 months; while Jupiter takes about 5
months and 10 days. Mars signifies a few days viz. 20 days or so. Mercury and
Venus are not uniform in their motion. Sun is very regular in motion and stays
in one Nakshatra or Constellation or Star for about 13 days. Moon takes about
24 hours in one Star. Hence the effects of Sun and Moon in transit should be
observed in the first instance for future guidance, because they show day to
day results.</span></p><h3 id="heading_07_Transit in Nakshatra or Star_2"><span lang="EN-US">Transit in Sub Nakshatra or Sub</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Amongst the slow moving planets Saturn
while transitting through one Nakshatra or Star remains in one Sub Nakshatra or
Sub for many weeks. Jupiter, Rahu and Ketu remain in one Sub for many days. So
their effects will be felt in general during these times.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun remains in one Sub for a period from
one to three days; while Moon for about three hours. Sun and Moon show specific
effects for a particular day and hour. So they are most important.</span></p><h3 id="heading_07_Transit in Nakshatra or Star_3"><span lang="EN-US">Example Birth Horoscope no. 1</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. We may now observe the effects of the
transitting planets in this birth map. The table showing the significator
planets for each house and that showing the houses signified by each planet are
given on the page 15.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. In this birth map Sun is the
significator of 6, 8, 10, 3 and 12. So whenever any planet transits in the star
area of Sun (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius 26</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 40</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> to Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn 10</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 0</span>′<span lang="EN-US">), it will influence the matters signified by the houses 6, 8, 10, 3
and 12; and so on with other significators as shown in the following table.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="298" src="img/image037.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Explanation. When any planet transists in
the star area of Ketu as shown in column 1, it will influence the houses shown
in column 2 against Ketu. When any planet transists in the star area of Saturn
as shown in column 1, it will influence the houses shown in column 2 against
Saturn and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3 (a) In this birth horoscope general bad
health is indicated; and Moon, Rahu and Saturn are the Significators of ill
health (i.e. of the house 6).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the planets transitting in the star area
of Moon, Rahu or/and Saturn will affect the health of the native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) In this birth horoscope Moon, Saturn
and Rahu are the significators of ill health and their Sub lords are also
malefic in effect (being connected with the houses 6 or 8). So Moon, Saturn and
Rahu are strongly evil for health.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence the planets transitting in the star
area of Moon, Saturn or/and Rahu will have worse effects on the health of the
native.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) In this birth horoscope the native is
running the joint period of Rahu, Rahu and Saturn from 18</span>–<span lang="EN-US">9</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1973 and it continues upto 22</span>–<span lang="EN-US">2</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1974.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the planets transitting in the star area
of Rahu or/and Saturn will give the same results as indicated by the joint
period of Rahu, Rahu and Saturn, if the Sub lords of these transitting planets
are not detrimental to the matters indicated by the joint period rulers; e.g.
the joint period of Rahu. Rahu and Saturn is not favourable for the health of
the native. Hence between 20-11-1973 and 2-12-1973 when Sun was transiting in
Scorpio 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US">20</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> to 16</span>°<span lang="EN-US">40</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the Star of Saturn and in the Subs of
Saturn (the significator of 6 and 8), Mercury (the significator of 1 and 6) and
Ketu (the significator of the maraka house 7 and the badhaka house 11), the
native suffered much from asthamatic condition.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On 23-11-1973 at the time when Moon was
transiting in Libra 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US">41</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in
the Sub of Saturn and onward the native suffered from acute asthamatic
condition. It continued till Moon in Scorpio crossed the star area of Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further as soon as Sun in Scorpio crossed
the star area of Saturn and entered the star area of Mercury on 2-12-1973 the
native was getting better.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(d) In this birth horoscope the native is
running the joint period of Rahu, Rahu and Ketu from 10-7-1974 upto 7-9-1974.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the planets transiting in the star area
of Rahu or/and Ketu will give the same results as indicated by the joint period
of Rahu Rahu and Ketu, if the Sub lords of these transiting planets are not
detrimental to the matters indicated by the joint period rulers; e.g. these
joint period rulers indicate the printing and publication work. Hence the
printing work of this book was started on 3-9-1974 during the joint period of
Rahu, Rahu, Ketu and Mercury. On that day the position of some planets in
transit was as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="147" src="img/image038.jpg" width="553"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The above transiting planets are either in
the Star or Sub of the period, sub period, inter period or sookshma period
ruler.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">None of the above planets is in the Sub of
a planet which is detrimental to the matter (printing and publication)
indicated by the joint period rulers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. It may be remembered that the sub lord
of the transiting planet should be connected with or it should not be
detrimental to the matters indicated by the star lord of the transiting planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) In this birth horoscope it was observed
that whenever the native received money from others Sun or/and Moon were
transiting in the star area of Mercury or/and Jupiter (the significators of 2),
and also Ketu (the significator of 11). These luminaries were at that time in
the sub area of Mercury or Jupiter or Ketu or any planet connected with the
matter of the houses 2, 6, 10 or 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) In this birth horoscope it was observed
in the past that whenever the work of writing books was going on, the planets
were transiting in the star area of Moon or/and Rahu (the significators of 9).
It was also continued during the time when the planets were transiting in the
star area of Venus or/and Sun (the significators of 3, 10 and 12).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The work of writing was active during the
days when Sun or/and Moon were transiting in the star area of Moon or/and Rahu</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many communications and contacts with
different persons were made during the days when Sun or/and Moon were
transiting in the star area of Venus or/and Sun (the significators of 3 and
10).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was also observed that when the printing
work of books was going on, the planets were transiting in the star area of
Ketu or/and Mars (the significators of 9 and 11).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun or/and Moon were transiting in the star
area of Ketu or/and Mars during the days when the printing work was in full
swing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) In this birth horoscope it was observed
that whenever the health was bad the planets were transiting in the star area
of Moon or/and Rahu and in the sub area of Saturn. It was especially so when
Sun or/and Moon were transiting in the star area of Moon/Rahu and in the sub
area of Saturn. Sun or/and Moon generally transited in the star and sub area of
Saturn when the health was worse.</span></p>
