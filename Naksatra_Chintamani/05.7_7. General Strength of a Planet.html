General Strength of a Planet_1"><span lang="EN-US">Strength by house</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. A planet mostly gives the results of the
house occupied by it and its owner comes next in order.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Of the houses the angles stand first in
strength, next the succedents and then the cadents.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. The owner of the house 6, 8 or 12 (as
counted from any particular house to be judged) becomes weak, evil or malefic
in effects.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.7_7. General Strength of a Planet_2"><span lang="EN-US">Strength by sign</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. A planet is strong when it is in its own
or exalted sign. It is weak or afflicted in its detriment or fall (debilitated)
sign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. The nature of the sign (e.g. cardinal or
movable, fixed, or common or mutable; fiery, earthy, airy or watery; fruitful
or barren; human or bestial; mute or voice; masculine or feminine etc) on the
cusp and that occupied by a planet influences the affairs of the house and the
planet.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.7_7. General Strength of a Planet_3"><span lang="EN-US">Strength by aspect</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. A planet in conj. or association with,
or aspected by a malefic (i.e. the owner of 6, 8 or 12) becomes weak or
afflicted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. An aspecting planet modifies the results
of the house matters according as it is a natural benefic or malefic, friendly
or inimical.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.7_7. General Strength of a Planet_4"><span lang="EN-US">Example birth horoscope no. 1.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. In the horoscope where the results of a
house are to be offered by an occupant or owner itself, the strength of the
occupant or owner may be examined, and where the results of a house are to be
offered by the planet in the occupant</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s or owner</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star, the strength of the star lord may be examined.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Sun and Venus are in the star Jupiter
which is in the 10th angle. So Sun and Venus become strong by house and they
are powerful to give the results of their star lord Jupiter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The results of the 2nd house are to be
offered by the occupant Moon (because there is no planet in Moon</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s star). Moon is in conj. with the natural malefic Rahu and it is
aspected by the owner of 12 (Jupiter). So Moon becomes weak in offering good
results of the 2nd house to the extent desired.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.6_6. Rahu - Ketu and their significance.html">← 6.
