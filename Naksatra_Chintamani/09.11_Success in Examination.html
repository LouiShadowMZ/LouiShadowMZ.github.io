significator of 4, 9 or 11, the success in examination is promised, when at the
time of examination (i. e. during the days of examination) the joint period of
the significators of 4, 9 and 11 is current.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.11_Success in Examination_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map the father put the query
about his son. So consider the 5th cusp as the son's Asc. and proceed. For
convenience the roman letter is given to each house counted from the 5th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is in the star Jupiter in IV. So it is
the significator of IV (examinations). Moon is aspected by Mercury owning XI
(success) and occupying IX (higher studies). Thus Moon clearly indicates that
the query refers to the examination results of the querent's son.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.11_Success in Examination_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp IV. The sub lord of IV cusp is
Mercury. It is in IX and retrograde. It is in the star Ketu in I and in the sub
Saturn in IX. So Mercury is the significator of I and connected with IX.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The examination of the querent's son
commenced on 12-4-1971 and it is to continue upto 23-4-1971. The cuspal sub
lord of IV (Mercury) remains in retrograde motion during these days. So the
querent's son will not get success in the examination for the time being.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp XI. The sub lord of XI cusp is Ketu.
It is in the star Mercury owning XI and occupying IX. It is in the sub Jupiter
in IV. So it is the significator of IX, XI and connected with IV.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But both the star lord and the sub lord of
this cuspal sub lord remain in retrograde motion during the days of the
examination. So the querent's son will not get success in the examination for
the time being.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.11_Success in Examination_4"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment and during the days
of the examination (Jupiter Dasha balance 4Y 3M 25D) the querent's son is
running the joint period of Jupiter, Moon and Rahu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All these three planets are the
significators of IV, IX and XI. But Jupiter the period ruler, Jupiter the star
lord of the sub period ruler (Moon) and Jupiter the sub lord of the interperiod
ruler (Rahu) remains in retrograde motion during the days of the examination.
So the querent's son will not get success in the examination for the time
being.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, in this case the point of
retrogradation comes in the way of success in the examination at every stage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The results of the examination were
declared on 27-5-1971 and unluckily the querent's son failed in the M.B.B.S.
examination.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.10_Lease Licence for Mines.html">← Lease Licence for Mines</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.11_Success in Examination">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.12_Scholarship.html">Scholarship →</a></div></body>
