independent business?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 125 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2', 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35'.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment. 26-7-1970, Sunday; 10-50
A.M. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="664" src="img/image102.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="130" src="img/image103.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.15_Independent Business_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of the 10th be the
significator of 2, 7 or 10 an independent business or profession is promised
during the joint period of the significators of 2, 7 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of the 7th be the
significator of 2, 10 or 11 gain in business is promised during the joint
period of the significators of 2, 10 and 11.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.15_Independent Business_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map Moon occupies the 7th
(business) and owns the 10th (profession). It is in the star Venus which owns
the Asc, 2 and occupies 11. So it is the significator of the Asc (self), 2
(self-earning) and 11 (gain and fulfilment of desire). Thus Moon clearly shows
that the query refers to self earning, profession or business dealings with
others and gain there from to fulfil the desire of the querent.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.15_Independent Business_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10th Cusp. The sub lord of the 10th cusp is
Moon. Its star lord Venus is direct. It is the significator of 2 and 11 as
discussed above. Hence an independent business is promised.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7th Cusp. The sub lord of the 7th cusp is
Ketu. It is in its own star Ketu which is in conj. with Venus owning 2 and
occupying 11. So Ketu represents Venus and it has to give the results of Venus.
Hence the cuspal sub lord of 7 (Ketu) is the significator of 2 and 11 and it
shows gain in business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th Cusp. The sub lord of the 11th cusp is
Venus. It is the significator of 2 and 11 being in its own star. Hence the
querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s desire will be fulfilled.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.15_Independent Business_4"><span lang="EN-US">7th House</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon the owner of 10 (profession) is in
conj. with Saturn the delaying planet in 7 (business). It is in applying conj..
So this position denotes that the querent has to keep patience for long.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But Moon is the significator of 2 and 11;
and Saturn is the significator of 10 and 11. So the querent will be successful
in the long run.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.15_Independent Business_5"><span lang="EN-US">Dasha Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment the querent is
running the period of Venus with 11Y 5M 21D in balance.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All the planets are the significators of 2,
7, 10 or 11; and the joint period of Venus, Rahu and Mercury is current from
14-7-1970 and continues upto 17-12-1970. So the querent will begin his business
activities during this very period. Actually he started his business in the
month of November 1970.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The period ruler Venus is the cuspal sub
lord of 11 and this period continues upto 17-1-1982. So the querent will
continue his business activities throughout this period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He has to pass the sub periods of Rahu,
Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and Ketu in the period of Venus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu, Mercury, Ketu and Venus are in the
sub Saturn. So the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s progress will be slow and
steady.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter is in the sub Venus and Saturn is
in the sub Moon. So their sub periods (17-3-1972 to 17-1-1978) will be
favourable for making progress in business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu is the sub lord of the 7th cusp and
its sub period starts from 17-1-1980 and continues upto 17-1-1982. As Ketu has
to give the results of Venus owning 2 and occupying 11, it will be better than
other sub period rulers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was learnt from the querent in the month
of December 1974 that he was conducting his business on a small scale with a
slow progress.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.14_Leaving the Job.html">← Leaving the Job</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.15_Independent Business">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.16_Marriage.html">Marriage →</a></div></body>
