Mercury. It is retrograde, but it gets direct in motion from 22-5-1970 and
crosses Aries 29</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 9' the point from where it turned
retrograde, on 7-6-1970. Its star lord Venus is direct in motion, it owns and
occupies the 12th. So Mercury is the significator of 12. Hence the foreign
travel is promised and the querent will go abroad after 7-6-1970 as the cuspal
sub lord Mercury is a fast moving planet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th Cusp. The sub lord of the 11th cusp is
Venus. It is direct in motion. It occupies the 12th. Its star lord Mars is

11 and 12. Hence the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s desire to go abroad will
be fulfilled soon because Venus is also a fast moving planet.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.17_Overseas For Studies_4"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Moon Dasha balance

This period continues upto 20-6-1970.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent desires to go to America for
higher studies. So the joint period rulers at the time of judgment should be
the significators of 3, 9, 12 and they should be connected with 4, 9 and 11. If
so, the querent will be able to go abroad for studies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The period ruler Moon is in its own
star(Moon) in 4 and in the sub Rahu in 9 (Rahu in Aquarius represents Saturn
owning 9 and occupying 11; it being aspected represents Jupiter in 4). So Moon
is the significator of 4 and connected with 4, 9 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub period ruler Rahu is in its own
star (Rahu) in 9 and in the sub Ketu in 3. So Rahu is the significator of 9 and
connected with 3 and also with 4 and 11 as discussed above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The inter period ruler Venus is in the star
Mars owning 11 and occupying 12 and in the sub Mercury owning 4 and occupying
11. So Venus is the significator of 11, 12 and connected with 4 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus the joint period rulers at the time of
judgment are the significators of foreign travel and also of higher studies. So
the querent will go abroad after 7-6-1970 and before 20-6-1970 during this very
joint period of Moon, Rahu and Venus, when the transit agrees.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.17_Overseas For Studies_5"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Actually he started for America by
