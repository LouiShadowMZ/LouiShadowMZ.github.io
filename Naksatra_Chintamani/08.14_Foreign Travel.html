significator of 3, 9 or 12 and especially of 9 foreign travel will be promised
during the joint period of the significators of 3, 9 and 12.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_Foreign Travel_2"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th cusp. In this birth map the sub lord
of the 12th cusp is Saturn. It owns 12 and occupies 3. It is in the star of
Venus which owns 9. So Saturn is the significator of 9 and connected with 3 and
12. Hence it promises foreign travel to the native.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_Foreign Travel_3"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of 3_ 9 and 12</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="143" src="img/image063.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the significators are Sun, Mars,
Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and Ketu. Out of them Jupiter is in its own sub in 3:
Venus is in the sub Saturn in 3 and Ketu is in the sub Venus owning 9. Hence
select Jupiter, Venus and Ketu as the strong significators of foreign travel.
The native will go abroad during the joint period of these three planets.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_Foreign Travel_4"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The native was born during the period of
Rahu with balance of 17Y 6M 2D. The joint period of Jupiter, Venus and Ketu
will start from 4-2-1969 and will continue upto 30-3-1969. So she will go
abroad during this period when the transit agrees with the joint period ruler
or rulers.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.14_Foreign Travel_5"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sun will transit in Aquarius in the star
Jupiter from 4-3-1969 upto 16-3-1969 and Venus will transit in Aries in the
star Ketu from 5-3-1969. So she will be able to go abroad before 16-3-1969.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Actually she started for London by
