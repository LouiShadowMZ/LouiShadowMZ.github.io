significator of 4, 11 or 12 one will have his own building during the joint
period of the significators of 4, 11 and 12.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.8_Constructing The Building_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent was trying to have a plot in a
Co-operative society but he was hesitating to invest money in the society.
Hence he made a query.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map Moon owns 4; its star
lord Mars aspects the 4th; its sub lord Ketu is in 4. So Moon is the
significator of 4 (building) and connected with Mars (land or building) and 4.
Hence it clearly shows that the query is regarding the building or house.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.8_Constructing The Building_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cuspal Sub lord</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">11th cusp The house 11 denotes society. So
if its sub lord is connected with the 4th house, the querent will be successful
in constructing a building in the Co-operative society.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Moon. It
is the significator of 4 as mentioned above. Its star lord Mars is direct in
motion. Moon is the fastest moving planet. So the querent will be succesful in
constructing his building in the Co-operative society very soon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4th cusp. The sub lord of the 4th cusp is
Venus. It is in its own star Venus in 12 and aspected by Mars. It is in the sub
Sun the significator of 4 (being in the star Moon owning 4) which is aspected
by the owner of 12 (Jupiter). So Venus is the significator of 12 (investment)
and connected with Mars (land or building), 4 (house or building) and 12.
Neither the cuspal sub lord Venus nor its star lord is retrograde. So it
promises a building to the querent.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.8_Constructing The Building_4"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="107" src="img/image083.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu being aspected represents Mars. None
of them is in the star or sub of a retrograde planet. So the ruling planets are
Mars, Mercury, Rahu, and Ketu.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.8_Constructing The Building_5"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of 4_ 11 and 12.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All these ruling planets are the
significators of 4, 11 and 12. Mars is in the star Moon owning 4. Mercury is in
the star Venus in 12. Rahu is in the star Mars (land). Ketu is in the star
Mercury in 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All these planets are in cardinal or
movable signs. So they will hasten the matter of construction during their
joint period.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.8_Constructing The Building_6"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Mars Dasha balance
2Y 5M 21D) the querent is running the joint period of Mars, Ketu and Venus. All
these planets are the significators for investment of money in constructing the
house as discussed above. Mars and Ketu are among the ruling planets. Ketu is
the sub period ruler and its sub period has started from 14-5-1971 and
continues upto 11-10-1971. In between this time the inter periods of Mars, Rahu
and Mercury will pass through. Rahu being stronger than any planet should be considered
as the inter period ruler.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars, Ketu and Rahu will jointly operate
from 15-7-1971 to 7-8-1971. So the querent will be successful in constructing
the house in the Cooperative Society during this time.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.8_Constructing The Building_7"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By this time Sun will be transitting in

1971 that the construction work of the house had reached upto the plinth level.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.7_Publication of a Book.html">← Publication of a Book</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.8_Constructing The Building">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.9_Selling The House.html">Selling The House →</a></div></body>
