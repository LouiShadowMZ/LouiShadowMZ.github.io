<body><h2 id="heading_09.4_Longevity_0"><span lang="EN-US">Longevity</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Question. When will my son recover from bad
health?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 119 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2', 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35'.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment. 23-3-1970, Monday; 10-25
p.m. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="501" src="img/image070.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="99" src="img/image071.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.4_Longevity_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sub lord of the Asc. be the
significator of the badhaka and maraka houses, the life is short.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal joint rulers (the sign lord,
star lord and sub lord) of the Asc. or the 8th cusp be the significators of the
badhaka and maraka houses, their joint period is very critical for life.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.4_Longevity_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map the mother asked the
question about her son. Moon occupies the 12th (worries to the querent). So
consider the 5th cusp as the Asc. for the son and proceed. For convenience the
roman letter is given to each house counted from the 5th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon is aspected by the owner of VIII (Sun)
and the owner of VI (Mercury). It is in its own star owning VII and occupying
VIII. It is in the sub Saturn owning I the Asc. of the son and II, and
occupying III. So Moon is the significator of VII (maraka), VIII (longevity)
and connected with I (health), II (maraka), III (longevity) and VI (sickness).
Thus Moon clearly indicates that the querent is worried about the health,
sickness and longevity of her son.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.4_Longevity_3"><span lang="EN-US">Son_s Asc.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is jointly ruled by Saturn (sign lord),
Moon (star lord) and Venus (sub lord). The sub lord of the Asc. is Venus. It is
in the star Mercury owning VI and occupying II. It is in the sub Moon owning
VII and occupying VIII. So it is the significator of the maraka house II and
connected with the maraka house VII.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We may now examine the strength of the star
lord and the sub lord of Venus. Venus's star lord Mercury is in conj. with the
owner of VIII (Sun) and aspected by the owner of the maraka house VII (Moon).
Venus's sub lord Moon is the significator of the maraka houses as discussed
above. Thus both the star lord and the sub lord of Venus are evil.
Consequently, the cuspal sub lord of the son's Asc. (Venus) becomes evil for
the son's longevity and it denotes short life.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.4_Longevity_4"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp VIII</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is jointly operated by Sun (sign lord),
Venus (star lord) and Saturn (sub lord).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) The cuspal sign lord of VIII Sun is in
the star Saturn owning the son's Asc. and II; it is in the sub Venus which is
the maraka significator. So Sun is the significator of the maraka houses II and
VII. Sun's star lord Saturn is in conj. with Mars the owner of the badhaka
house XI and aspected by the owner of XII (Jupiter); so Saturn becomes evil.
Sun's sub lord Venus is in association with the owner of VI (Mercury) and the
owner of VIII (Sun); so Venus becomes evil.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Consequently, the cuspal sign lord of VIII
Sun becomes connected with the badhaka and maraka houses; and it becomes evil
for the son's longevity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The cuspal star lord of VIII Venus is
the significator of the maraka houses II and VII as previously discussed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(c) The cuspal sub lord of VIII Saturn is
in the star and sub of Venus which is the maraka significator of II and VII; so
Saturn is the maraka significator.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, the sign lord, star lord, and sub
lord of VIII cusp all the three are the significators of the badhaka and maraka
houses.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.4_Longevity_5"><span lang="EN-US">Joint period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the time of judgment (Moon Dasha balance
5Y 1M 19D) the querent's son is running the joint period of Moon (the star lord
of the son's Asc.), Saturn (the sign lord of the son's Asc. and the sub lord of
VIII cusp) and Venus (the sub lord of the son's Asc. and the star lord of VIII
cusp). This period expires on 11-6-1970. They all are the significators of the
maraka houses as discussed above. So they denote danger to the son's life.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now the joint period of Moon, Saturn and
Sun (the sign lord of VIII cusp) starts from 11-6-1970 and lasts upto 9-7-1970.
Moon and Saturn are the maraka significators; while Sun is both the badhaka and
maraka significator as previously discussed. So this period will prove fatal to
the life of the querent's son.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.4_Longevity_6"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The querent's son expired on 18-6-1970
during this very joint period of Moon, Saturn and Sun. Moon was transitting in
Scorpio 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US">54</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in the star
Saturn (the period ruler).</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.3_Judging the Horary Map.html">← Judging the Horary Map</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.4_Longevity">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.5_Disease.html">Disease →</a></div></body>
