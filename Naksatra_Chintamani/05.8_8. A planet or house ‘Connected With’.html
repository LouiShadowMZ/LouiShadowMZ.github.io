with in any manner</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> is very wide in its meaning.</span></p><h3 id="heading_05.8_8. A planet or house ‘Connected With’_4"><span lang="EN-US">4. Example birth horoscope no. 1.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally speaking the occupant or owner of
the house, the planet in the star of the occupant or owner of the house and the
planet in conj. or in aspect with the significator of that house come under the
category of the significators of that house and these significators are termed
as connected with that house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this birth map Jupiter is the occupant
of 10 and the owner of 3 and 12; the planet Sun is in the star of Jupiter the
occupant of 10 and the owner of 3 and 12; and the planet Venus is in conj. with
the significator of 10, 3 and 12 (Sun). Thus Jupiter, the planet Sun and the
planet Venus come under the category of the significators of 10, 3 and 12. So
they are term as </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">connected with</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> the houses 10, 3 and 12. The term </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">connected
with</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> has been used in this sense throughout the book.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Broadly speaking Jupiter, the planet Sun
and the planet Venus are the significators of 10, 3 and 12, but strictly
speaking the planet Sun (which has to give the results of its star lord
Jupiter) is the significator of 10, 3 and 12. However, the term </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">significator</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> has been used in both the
sense according as the case may be throughout the book.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Lastly, Sun is in the star Jupiter owning
3, 12 and occupying 10; it is in the sub Saturn owning 1, 2 and occupying 4.
Now to facilitate distinction between the matters of the star lord and that of
the sub lord, it may be said that Sun is the significator of 10, 3 and 12; and
connected with 1, 2 and 4. This procedure may be adopted for all planets.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="05.7_7. General Strength of a Planet.html">← 7.
