horoscope or a horary map indicates more than three or four significators
regarding the matter to be judged, unimportant significators may be eliminated
with the aid of the ruling planets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note the ruling planets of the moment when
you begin to analyse and judge the horoscope.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The common planets between the
significators (of the matter to be judged) and the ruling planets may be
considered as the final significators and the rest may be eliminated </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Father</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s death : In
this birth horoscope we may judge the death of the native</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s father. Consider the 9th house cusp Aries 28</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 6</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> as the Asc. for the father. For
convenience the roman letters are given to each house counted from the 9th
cusp. Now find out the significators of the badhaka and maraka houses for the
father.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Significators of death</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="162" src="img/image030.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So the significators are Mercury, Rahu,
Mars, Ketu, Venus and Saturn. Rahu in Capricorn represents Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling planets at the time of judgment</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This birth horoscope was taken up for
analysis on 13</span>–<span lang="EN-US">3</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1972 Monday at
3</span>–<span lang="EN-US">50 p.m. I.S.T., 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> E 35</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="80" src="img/image031.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu in Capricorn represents Saturn. Ketu
in Cancer represents Moon and as Ketu is aspected by Mars, it represents Mars.
So take Rahu and Ketu in place of Moon, Mars and Saturn. Thus the ruling
planets will be Mercury, Rahu and Ketu.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The common planets between the
significators of death and the ruling planets are Mercury, Ketu and Rahu. So
they may be considered as the final significators of death and the rest may be
eliminated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period. The native was born with
balance of Saturn dasha 17Y 5M 23P. His father died during the joint period of
Mercury (the period ruler), Ketu (the sub period ruler) and Rahu (the inter
period ruler) on 1</span>–<span lang="EN-US">11</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1936.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Transit. On that day Sun was transitting in
Libra 16</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> in the star of Rahu (the inter period ruler);
Rahu in Sagittarius 3</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 52</span>′<span lang="EN-US"> in
the star of Ketu(the sub period ruler) and Ketu in Gemini the sign owned by
Mercury (the period ruler).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Conclusion. From the above it will be clear
that the ruling planets at the moment of judgment agree or tally with the
significators of the matter under judgment or consideration.</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.3_3. Ruling Planets and Significators_2"><span lang="EN-US">_2_ Significators and Ruling Planets at the time of event</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this case the father of the native died
at about 9.30 p.m. I.S.T. on Sunday 1</span>–<span lang="EN-US">11</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1936; 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling planets at the time of death</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="83" src="img/image032.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At this moment Ketu was in Gemini. So it
represents Mercury. Hence the ruling planets are Mercury, Rahu, Ketu, Venus,
Sun and Moon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Out of them Mercury, Ketu and Rahu are the
significators of death during whose joint period the event of death occurred.
Thus it may be said that the ruling planets at the time of event will tally or
agree with the significators of that event.</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.3_3. Ruling Planets and Significators_3"><span lang="EN-US">_3_ Ruling Planets at the time of judgment and event</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From the above it may also be concluded
that the ruling planets at the time of event will be the same as at the time of
judgment.</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.3_3. Ruling Planets and Significators_4"><span lang="EN-US">_4_ Joint period rulers of one and the Ruling planets of
another</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) Example birth horoscope No. 1: The
native of this horoscope came in contact with one genius friend for the first
time on 17</span>–<span lang="EN-US">10</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1973 during the
joint period of Rahu, Rahu (the period and sub period ruler) and Saturn (the
inter period ruler).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) Ruling planets at the birth of the
friend</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This friend was born on 26</span>–<span lang="EN-US">7</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1925 at about 5H 2M A.M. I.S.T. before Sun
rise on Sunday (i.e. Saturday); 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 41</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 55</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="86" src="img/image033.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the moment of birth Rahu in Cancer was
in conj. with Sun and aspected by Saturn in Libra. So Rahu represents both Sun
and Saturn. Ketu is in Capricorn and aspected by Sun. So Ketu also represents
both Sun and Saturn. Hence the ruling planets are Sun, Mercury, Jupiter,
Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. Out of them Rahu and Saturn agree or tally with the
joint period rulers in the native</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s horoscope.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hence it may be said that the ruling
planets at the moment of birth of your married partner or your child or your
friend or your business partner etc., will agree with your joint period rulers
(i.e. the period, sub period and inter period rulers) during which you got
married or you got a child or you met a friend for the first time or you joined
in the partnership business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These ruling planets may either be in the
star or sub of, or be in conj. or aspect with the joint period rulers in your
horoscope.</span></p><h3 id="heading_06.3_3. Ruling Planets and Significators_5"><span lang="EN-US">_5_ Ruling Planets and Affinity</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the ruling planets of one be the
significators of 6, 8 or 12 and not of 1, 5 or 11 in the horoscope of the
other, then during the period of the significators of 6, 8 or 12, the latter
will not feel happy with the former. But during the period of the significators
of 1, 5 or 11, the latter will feel amicable with the former.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this case the friend</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s ruling planets e.g. Rahu and Saturn become the significators of 6
and 8 in the native</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s horoscope; while the remaining
ruling planets are not so.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The native was running the joint period of
Rahu, Rahu and Saturn from 18</span>–<span lang="EN-US">9</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1973 to 22</span>–<span lang="EN-US">2</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1974.
So in February 1974 an atmosphere of ill feeling between the two was created.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But the joint period of Rahu, Rahu and
Mercury (the significator of 1) commenced on 22</span>–<span lang="EN-US">2</span>–<span lang="EN-US">1974 and subsequently amicability was restored.</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="06.2_2.
