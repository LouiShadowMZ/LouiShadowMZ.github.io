<h1 id="heading_02_Forward_0"><span lang="EN-US">Forward</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Shri Chandrakant R. Bhatt B.A.LL.B. is a
zealous research student of Astrology. He has written several books on
Astrology. Originally he was an advocate of Sayana system of Astrology
popularly known as Western system. Some seven years back during his frequent
visits to me, we had a good deal of discussion about the beauties and accuracy
of Nirayana system of Astrology or Indian Astrology. He gradually turned his
attention to the study of Nirayana system of Astrology and to-day he has become
an ardent advocate of Hindu Astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">'Nakshatra Chintamani' is his further
contribution in the field of Astrology. Nakshatras (Constellations) play
important role in the field of, not only predictive side of Astrology but also
in all the religious ceremonies of the Hindus.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Vimshottary Dasha system in timing
events advocated by the great Parashar is based on constellation and its sub
divisions. For perfectly judging the strength or weakness of a house and its
lord the Astrologer has to take into consideration the sign and the
constellation and its sub division, for then only he can evaluate the physical
(Sthula), the astral (Sukshma) and Casual (Karan) strength and weakness of the
sign and its lord. Thus the 12 signs of the Zodiac are divided into 249
divisions of the 27 constellations. The effect of any planet can be judged well
if we know the placement in the horoscope, of the lord of the house, the lord
of the constellation and the lord of the sub division of the constellation it
is placed in. Thus a planet is controlled by the lord of the sign, the lord of
the constellation and the lord of the sub division of the constellation. For
the last thousand years or more the Northern part of India was constantly
invaded by the invaders from Central Asia. Great centres of learning in the
North were plundered and valuable literatures were reduced to ashes.
Fortunately the remote Southern part of India was saved from the plunders of
these invaders and the families of the great scholars of the South preserved
the rich heritage of knowledge including knowledge of Astrology propounded by
great Rishes of India.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">With the passage of time constellational
Astrology became a family secret of the Astrologers in the South and there was
little literature in the form of books available for the general mass of the
students of Astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Shri Gopal Krishna Rao of Madras has
written three parts of Nadi Astrology. Shri Seetaram Sharma of Bangalore has
also written a book entitled 'A Gateway to Astrology'. The family members of
the great Shri B. Suryanarayana Rao of Bangalore the founder of 'Astrological
Magazine' and particularly Shri B. V. Raman the prince among Astrologers and
the present editor of 'Astrological Magazine' who has established the
genuineness of Hindu Astrology as a perfect science not only in India but also
in the world have brought Astrology to the reach of the students of Astrology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The late Jyotish Martand Shri K. S.
Krishnamurti of Madras has also contributed greatly to the spread of the
knowledge of constellational Astrology not only by publishing books and the
magazine 'Astrology and Athrishta' but also by moving in every important corner
of India and lecturing on constellational Astrology. He has termed this
constellational Astrology as Krishnamurti Paddhati and which according to him
is the only perfect Paddhati (system). This claim of the late Jyotish Martand
Shri K. S. Krishnamurti has created a good deal of controversy regarding its
efficacy and perfectness. But in my humble opinion the Paddhati (method) is the
accumulation of the essential preachings of the great Parashar, Gaimini,
Mantreshwar, Gancsh Divagna, Ramdayalu Varahimihir, Kalidas and host of other
astrologers of the past and it deserves considerations and further research to
eradicate its short comings.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Much hidden knowledge of Astrology yet
remains to be dug out. Shri B. V. Raman, the learned and the world renowned
editor of 'Astrological Magazine' has been doing great service to the world of
Astrology by procuring manuscripts of this science and making them public.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Shri Chandrakant R. Bhatt inspite of his
failing health has been ceaselessly researching on the constellational
Astrology and this book 'Nakshatra Chintamani' is the fruit of his sincere
labour and research. He has evolved and discussed only those principles of
predicting which he has found workable in giving correct predictions. It is for
the readers to judge the merit or otherwise of this book.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Shri Vivek Education Trust, Maninagar,
Ahmedabad has undertaken to publish this book with an humble view to contribute
to the spread of knowledge of Astrology which has its roots in Vedas.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We only request the readers neither to
accept nor reject the principles of predicting discussed by Shri Bhatt in this
book but examine them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">28-3-1975</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">C/o Shri Sardar Patel &amp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Swami Vivekanand High School,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Maninagar, Ahmedabad 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Shambhuprasad M.
