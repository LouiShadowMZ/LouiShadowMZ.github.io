birth should be erected according to the Western (Sayana) system with the aid
of Raphael</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s Ephemeris and Table of Houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Deduct ayanamsa for the required year of
birth from the Sayana positions of the cusps of the houses and from those of
the planets. So that the birth horoscope according to the Indian (Nirayana)
system will be prepared. This horoscope should be written in the manner of a
Western Horoscope.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ayanamsa adopted for the A. D. year 1901 is
22</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 23'. Then go on adding 50 seconds every year and

Horoscope explained_4"><span lang="EN-US">Inserting the Signs and the Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. The beginning point of each house is
called the Cusp. The signs and degrees should be written down on the cusps of
the houses in the blank map. In the example birth horoscope no. 1 Capricorn 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 25' is placed on the cusp of the 1st house i.e. Asc. Aquarius 19</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 44' on the cusp of the 2nd house and so on. In this way the signs
and degrees on all the 12 cusps of the houses have been written down.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. (a) The cusp of the 3rd house begins
with Pisces 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 44'. But the longitudes of Moon and
Rahu in Pisces are 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 49' and 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 36' respectively. They are less than the cuspal degree of the 3rd
house. So they are placed behind the cuspal degree of the 3rd house and they
may be considered as posited in the 2nd house. If a planet is within 5</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> of the cuspal degree of a house, it exerts its influence on both
the houses. In this case Moon and Rahu are within 5</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> of
the cuspal degree of the 3rd house. So they can be said to be on the cusp of
the 3rd house and they will exert some influence both on the 2nd and the 3rd
house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly Saturn in Taurus 7</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 30' is placed behind Taurus 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 28' the
cusp of the 5th house and it is said to be in the 4th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mars in Leo 1</span>°<span lang="EN-US">40'
is placed behind Leo 19</span>°<span lang="EN-US">44' the cusp of the 8th house
and it is said to be in the 7th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ketu in Virgo 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US">36'
is placed behind Virgo 25</span>°<span lang="EN-US">44' the cusp of the 9th house
and it is on the cusp of the 9th house. So Ketu will exert some influence on
the 8th house and some on the 9th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter in Scorpio 14</span>°<span lang="EN-US">2' R is placed behind Scorpio 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 28' the
cusp of the 11th house and it is said to be in the 10th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The cusp of the 6th house begins with
Gemini 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US">44'. But the longitudes of Sun and Venus in
Gemini are 22</span>°<span lang="EN-US">33' and 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">00'
respectively. They are greater than the cuspal degree of the 6th house. So they
are placed in front of Gemini 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US">44' and they are said
to be in the 6th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Similarly Mercury in Cancer 13</span>°<span lang="EN-US">2' is placed in front of Cancer 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US">25' the
cusp of the 7th house and it is said to be in the 7th house.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. All the houses in the horoscope are not
of equal dimensions. The house may be less or greater than 30 degrees.
Sometimes one house may contain more than one sign. Such a sign is termed as
'Intercepted'.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the example birth horoscope no. 1 the
5th house commences from Taurus 21</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 28' and extends
upto Gemini 15</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 44'. So the 5th house is of 24</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 16' dimension.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 7th house begins with Cancer 12</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 25' and ends at Leo 19</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 44'. So the 7th
house consists of 37</span>°<span lang="EN-US"> 19' and so on with other houses.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="288" src="img/image004.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rahu in Pisces represents Jupiter and Ketu
