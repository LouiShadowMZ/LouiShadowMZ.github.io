Venus. It owns 12; its star lord Moon is in 10 and aspected by the owner of 12
(Venus); its sub lord Saturn (being in the star Sun owning 3) is the
significator of 3. So the cuspal sub lord of 3 (Venus) is the significator of
10, 12 and connected with 3 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">12th cusp. The sub lord of the 12th cusp is
Moon. It is in 10; its star lord Mercury is in 6 and aspects the 12th and
aspected by the occupant of 3 (Mars); its sub lord Jupiter owns 10 and occupies
3. So the cuspal sub lord of 12 (Moon) is the significator of 6, 12, 3 and
connected with 3 and 10.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">10th cusp. The sub lord of the 10th cusp is
Rahu. It is in the star and sub Jupiter owning 10 and occupying 3. So the

Mercury with balance of 4Y 9M 19D. So he has to pass the periods of Ketu,
Venus, Sun, Moon and so on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The periods of Mercury, Ketu and Venus were
passed in early years of life. He started his career during the period of Sun
(29-8-1964 to 29-8-1970). Sun is not among the cuspal sub lords of 3, 10 and
12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Then starts the period of Moon (29-8-1970
to 29-8-1980). Moon, Rahu and Venus are the cuspal sub lords of 12, 10 and 3
respectively. They are the significators of and connected with 3, 10 and 12.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The native is an officer in the Bank at
Ahmedabed. Now in the period of Moon, the sub period of Rahu will start earlier
than Venus (29-1-1972 to 29-7-1973). So during the period of Moon, in the sub
period of Rahu and in the inter period of Venus (16-1-1973 to 16-4-1973), he
will be transferred to some other city. Actually he was transferred to the
Bombay office in the month of March 1973.</span></p><h3 id="heading_08.8_Transfer in Service_4"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">He took charge in the Bombay office on
