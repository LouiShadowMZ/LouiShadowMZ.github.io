<body><h2 id="heading_09.12_Scholarship_0"><span lang="EN-US">Scholarship</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Question. Will my son get scholarship?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Number. 45 (out of 249)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Place of Judgment. 23</span>°<span lang="EN-US">N 2</span>′<span lang="EN-US">, 72</span>°<span lang="EN-US">E 35</span>′<span lang="EN-US">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Time of Judgment. 19-1-1970, Monday; 10-17
A.M. I.S.T.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="472" src="img/image092.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="127" src="img/image093.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><h3 id="heading_09.12_Scholarship_1"><span lang="EN-US">Hints</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal sublord of the 11th be the
significator of 2 (money), 6 (scholarship) or 11 (gain) and connected with the
house 4 (studies), one gets scholarship for studies during the joint period of
the significators of 2, 6 and 11.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the cuspal joint rulers (the sign lord,
star lord and sub lord) of the 6th and/or 11th be the significators of 2, 6 and
11 and connected with the 4th, one gets scholarship during their joint period.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.12_Scholarship_2"><span lang="EN-US">Moon</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In this horary map the father asked the
question about his son. Moon is in 12 (worries to the querent). Consider the
5th cusp as the Asc. for the son and proceed. For convenience the roman letter
is given to each house counted from the 5th cusp.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Moon owns XI, its star lord Mars owns II
and occupies VI. So Moon is the significator of II (money to the son), VI
(scholarship to the son) and connected with XI (gain to the son). Hence Moon
clearly indicates that the querent is worried about the scholarship to his son.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.12_Scholarship_3"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp XI</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The sub lord of XI cusp is Mars. It owns II
and occupies VI; it is direct in motion. Its star lord Jupiter is direct in
motion, it owns IV and occupies the Asc. of the son. Its sub lord Rahu (being
in Aquarius) represents Saturn owning VI. So Mars is the significator of IV and
connected with II and VI. Hence the scholarship for studies is promised to the
querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s son.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.12_Scholarship_4"><span lang="EN-US">Cusp VI</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is jointly governed by Saturn (sign
lord), Jupiter (star lord) and Saturn (sub lord). Saturn owns VI; it is in the
star Ketu in XI and in the sub Jupiter owning IV; so Saturn is the significator
of XI and connected with IV and VI.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jupiter owns IV; it is in the star Rahu
which represents Saturn owning VI and in the sub Saturn; so Jupiter is the
significator of VI and connected with IV and VI.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus Mars (the sub lord of XI cusp),
Jupiter (the star lord of VI cusp) and Saturn (the sub lord of VI cusp) are the
significators of and connected with II, IV, VI and XI.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.12_Scholarship_5"><span lang="EN-US">Ruling Planets</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><img height="94" src="img/image094.jpg" width="554"/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">None of these planets is in the star or sub
of a retrograde planet. So the ruling planets are Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Venus
and Saturn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The common planets between the ruling
planets and the significators of II, IV, VI and XI (mentioned above) are Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.12_Scholarship_6"><span lang="EN-US">Joint Period</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(a) At the time of judgment (Mars Dasha
balance 4Y 1M 1D) the querent</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s son is running the
joint period of Mars and Saturn. They both are the ruling planets as well as
the significators of scholarship. So it is certain that the son will get
scholarship during their joint period.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The final significators as discussed above
are Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. So the son will get his scholarship during the
joint period of Mars, Saturn and Jupiter (27-6-1970 to 20-8-1970).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(b) The sub lord of VI cusp (scholarship)
is Saturn. It is a slow moving planet. So he will receive the full amount of
scholarship gradually.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Actually, he first received a part amount
of scholarship on 19-2-1970 when Moon was transitting in Cancer in the star of
Saturn (the sub period ruler).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There after, he received part amounts of
scholarship regularly every month and the final amount was received in the
month of July 1970 during the joint period of Mars, Saturn and Jupiter.</span></p><h3 id="heading_09.12_Scholarship_7"><span lang="EN-US">Transit</span></h3><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In July 1970 Sun was transitting in Gemini
in the star Jupiter (the inter period ruler); Mars in Cancer in the star Saturn
(the sub period ruler) and Jupiter in Libra in the star Mars (the period
ruler).</span></p><div class="nav-container"><a class="nav-btn prev-btn" href="09.11_Success in Examination.html">← Success in Examination</a><a class="nav-btn toc-btn" href="toc.html#file_09.12_Scholarship">Content</a><a class="nav-btn next-btn" href="09.13_Employment.html">Employment →</a></div></body>
