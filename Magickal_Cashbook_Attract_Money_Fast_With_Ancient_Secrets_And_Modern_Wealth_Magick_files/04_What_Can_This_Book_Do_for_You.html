you are now. How wealthy you become is your choice. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can attract a small amount of money,
just once, and leave magick behind forever. Or you can keep using magick,
adapting your life to build wealth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Whether you want to get emergency cash or
build a strong financial future, the Magical Cashbook is a powerful method for
generating reasonable amounts of money, on an ongoing basis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This small, simple book is easy to make.
Essentially, you buy a notebook, cover it in symbols and perform a basic ritual
to give it power. Despite the simple method, you can attract cash in a short
length of time. The book takes a few minutes to make and charge, but then it
works wonders.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It's well known that many famous occultists
of old died in poverty. So why have I written a book on attracting money with
magick? </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We now have more knowledge and experience,
and when certain conditions are met, magick works, and it works well.
Satisfying these conditions is easy. I need to show you that money magick can
work, and it can work easily and powerfully.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I made various pacts with my mentors over
the years, which require me to share my magickal knowledge. I am a member of
The Gallery of Magick. There are seventeen of us, and we have been working for
over three decades to develop practical magick. I am pleased to begin sharing
our work with this book, and I have made a commitment to only share magick that
works well.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Too much money magick is weak or
unworkable, and that's a shame because it makes people believe that magick
doesn't work, or that money magick is somehow unspiritual. I want to change
that by putting powerful, practical magick in your hands.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When used well, money magick is a
relatively easy way to bring more money into your life. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I'm confident that the methods in this book
are powerful enough that you’ll get what you came looking for, and more
besides. Just make sure you read the whole book, and understand everything
before you begin.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But can this really work? Isn’t it just a
money-making scam? I’ve worked as an author (under another name) for a few
decades, and I can assure you that these days writing books is not the best way
to get rich, so that’s not why I share these secrets. The magick is genuine. It
brings real results. It’s shared now so that you can see the reality of magick,
which can lead you on many wonderful journeys. With magick, you can live your
dreams the way you want to live them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Does it work for everybody? If you look at
the reviews, you’ll see that some people say, ‘It does not work.’ But there’s
always a reason. The magick <i>does</i> work. It works for <i>most</i> people.
You can see that in most of the reviews, as well as in thousands of posts on
our website. People really do find success.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So why doesn’t it work for everybody? Some
people expect instant cash and lottery wins. Some don’t read the instructions.
Some don’t settle into the work, and many are impatient. You need to read the
book carefully, you need to be patient, you need to let the results come when
they come, and you need to avoid desperation. If you are able to do that, the
magick <i>will</i> work. And when it does, that’s a beautiful feeling. </span></p>
