First Big Break</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Decide now, what amount will be impressive,
unexpected and exciting to you. If $20 would excite you, be honest, and say you
want $20. If you’d be amazed by $1000, that’s also fine. If you’re already
wealthy, and wouldn’t be impressed unless you make $100,000 of extra income out
of the blue, then you need to be certain of that too.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The reason for this is that money <i>will</i>
turn up when you make your Magical Cashbook. When it does, I want you to know
that the magick worked.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sometimes, you might find a monthly expense
is $50 less than expected. That’s a result. Sometimes you might find $20
stuffed down the side of a chair. That’s a result. Or you might get a promotion
or a bonus. And there are hundreds, if not thousands, of creative ways that
magick can provide the money. Don’t expect the money to come in a particular
way. Let it come in any way, at any speed, and then it will come fast and
creatively.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It would be sad if you dismissed the
magick, and said, 'Oh, that's just a coincidence.' In reality, it is usually a
series of chance events and encounters that lead to magickal success. So when
you see coincidence, welcome it and know that the magick helped. The more
grateful you feel for your results, the more likely you are to get them in the
future.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Decide now what amount would convince you
that magick is real, and then write it down somewhere secret. If this amount
turns up, you know you can trust this book to help you, and you can keep using
magick.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Magick usually makes you a little bit more
money than you think is possible. You need to consider that statement
carefully.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you’d be excited by $100, then you’ll
probably make slightly more than that on your first attempt at making money
with magick. And if you need $50,000, then that’s what you’ll get, and perhaps
a little bit more. If $50 would be a true thrill, you should make more than
$50.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if you’re the sort of person who’s in
true poverty, and if $100 is a big deal to you, I will not lie and say you can
win the lottery or make $50,000 out of nowhere. You can get there eventually.
You can get there faster than you thought possible. But expect your <i>own
personal surprise</i> and an amount of money that is meaningful to <i>you</i>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One problem with most money magick is that
it takes time to work. The Magickal Cashbook works fast. You can get some money
quickly, almost instantly. Then you can use the rituals to attract steady
income and bursts of money. But it’s really important that you don’t <i>insist</i>
that it works fast. You need to let the results come when they come, in
whatever way they come. I’ve often said if you can wait a year for something,
magick makes it happen instantly, but if you insist it happens instantly, you
might have to wait a year. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can work on this, by learning patience.
The more patient you are, the faster you get what you want. If you don’t get
what you want the first time, keep going, knowing that magick <i>is</i> real.
That sort of trust and involvement with magick is so much more powerful than
doing one ritual and hoping for a big result. Magick is not about hope, but
about shaping your reality.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you want to win the lottery, that's
quite normal, most people do. But if you're serious about making more money,
I'd advise you to give up the lottery altogether. When you give up random
gambling, you're sending a message out to the universe that you trust that
money will turn up. That is way more powerful than hoping for a win.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also, I have to be upfront and say that
most people find magick doesn't work for lotteries. Magick is only one way of
influencing the world, and when you enter a lottery, you are up against the
powers of random effects and astronomical odds. Even the strongest ritual will
struggle to change the way those numbers fall.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A more successful approach is to use magick
to guess the correct numbers in advance. That way, you're not trying to
influence the fall of numbers itself - you’re merely trying to use magick to
select the right numbers for yourself. But magick is more fun than a lottery
win. When you see money conjure its way into your life on a regular basis, you
don't need a lottery win. When you feel comfortable with that, the magick will
work even faster.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since this book was first published in
2014, there’s one story that I’ve been told over and over again. Somebody does
their first ritual and asks for $5000 or $1000 or something that is way out of
reach for them. Nothing happens. They give up. But then a few months later they
try again, and they try for something that is just out of reach, and it works –
maybe $20 maybe $200 - and then all the rituals begin to work. Consider this
carefully, and avoid desperation and demanding too much. Seek what would be exciting
for you, but not an absurd amount. If you build steadily, you get to a place of
riches much faster than if you demand riches right now.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It’s true that there are stories online and
in reviews where people have made thousands in a few days, with the Magickal
Cashbook, and others even more, but don’t let the big success stories put you
off from starting small. You may get a pleasant surprise, and more than you
hoped for, but be willing to build gradually. The big amounts come to those
with natural magickal abilities and a high level of patience. It can take time
to build those skills, so go in with an open mind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although your mind should be open, try to
avoid testing the magick. If you perform it as an experiment to see if it will
work and then stare at your watch waiting for a result, I know it will <i>not</i>
work. Perform it as though it is real, and assume it will work.</span></p>
