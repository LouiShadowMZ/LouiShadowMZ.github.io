and New</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Why is this book a mix of ancient secrets
and new technology? If you've done a lot of magick before, you'll know that
there are millions upon millions of opinions and theories about magick. People
stay up late arguing about what works, why it works and how to make it work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some say that ancient secrets are
worthless. Some say you don't need any magickal tools so long as you have
imagination. Others suggest that you need to perform every gesture and ritual
exactly the way it was written in an ancient grimoire, or you will never get
results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thankfully, whatever the exact truth about
magick may be, <i>magick works</i>. I've found that it works by using new ideas
and ancient secrets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rather than trying to decide which theory
is best, or why magick works, I'll simply provide you with the fastest and most
practical money magick that can solve a lot of your financial problems.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The magick in this book is based around the
creation of a Magickal Cashbook, which is a way of connecting several forms of
magick with your clear intention to make more money.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Cashbook is nothing more than a small,
simple notebook, painted with colors and symbols. You charge the book using a
fairly basic magick ritual and then write in the amount of money you want to
attract. The money then manifests, often in an unexpected way. It takes only
days to work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I’ve described this in a mundane way, but
the book is far from mundane. When it works for you, you will realize that you
have created an object of genuine power.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You may wonder why magick works. It doesn’t
matter why magick works, but I know that many people worry about this, even
though the time taken to perform such simple magick is minimal. This curiosity
is fine, but the best way to learn about magick is to use magick, and the more
you use it, the more you understand how it works.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When magick begins to work, you may <i>really</i>
begin to wonder why it works, and you may find, as many do, that when you
attract a large sum of money, you feel guilty. Do you have the right to take
this money from the world? This guilty feeling usually passes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But when you see that the world responds to
your magick, you will begin to wonder about your place in the universe and the
meaning of magick. This is a good thing, and a pleasant side-effect, but it
should not be your aim. Your aim should be to get magick working.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many would disagree and say that the only
purpose of magick is to contact your Holy Guardian Angel and heal others. In my
experience, there’s no substitute for <i>doing magick and getting results</i>.
The better you are at practical magick, the better you will be at <i>any</i>
spiritual work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For every magician who actually does
magick, there are countless who simply think or read about magick. If you only
think about magick, nothing magickal will ever happen. Practice the magick in
this book, and you will see things change.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There are three key requirements for
successful magick, and they are easy to achieve. I will not force you to find
rare herbs, create complex tools or meditate for hours. This book is about
taking the shortest possible route to magickal success. The key requirements
are:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">A clear intent.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">A precise magickal method.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">A certain state of mind. </span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I’ll show you exactly how to get all three
right.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I can’t tell you why magick works, whether
the spirits are real or imaginary, whether we’re using quantum physics or mere
imagination. I have theories and beliefs, but I won’t bore you with them.
Instead, I will put the magick in your hands and let you come up with your own
ideas about why it works.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The methods in this book will cost you
almost nothing, in terms of time or money, but will bring you great rewards.
You don’t even have to believe. You can act out the rituals, and so long as you
do it with the conviction that an actor would, <i>as though it is real</i>,
then your belief doesn’t matter at all. The magick will work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The magick in my books has been developed
by The Gallery of Magick to get results safely. There is plenty of evil in the
world, but there is no evil in this book. You will not be punished by karma or
chased down by demons. Magick is about taking control of your life, rather than
being controlled by circumstances, people or random chaos. Taking control of
your life with magick is your divine right.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You may also worry about payback, and
whether there are dangers. You can trust me when I say that this magick is very
safe, and there is never any backlash. Some people worry that magick gives an
unfair advantage, and so that means the universe will find a way of taking the
money back from you. None of this is true. It’s pure superstition, and it
ignores a very obvious fact: the universe is not in balance, and it is not
fair, especially when it comes to money. There is an unbelievable lack of
equality in the world. People live in luxury with billions in the bank, and the
universe never punishes them or balances it out. Other people live in poverty
and the universe never balances it out. So, put the idea of universal balance
out of your mind. It doesn’t exist, and it’s your right to attract more money
than you have now.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Others hear stories that magick will cause
a horrible accident, to bring the money to you through an insurance claim or
inheritance. Again, this is disinformation designed to scare you away from
magick. In all the decades that I have worked with magick, I have never seen
such disasters occur. It’s actually quite easy to get money flowing, and magick
won’t cause havoc, because it doesn’t need to.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Magick gives you the <i>choice</i> to
increase your level of income, and there is no universal force that will take
it away from you. You need to feel comfortable with money, and avoid feeling
guilty about money magick. Make sure you’re relaxed about having more than you
have now. If you resent other people making money, or feel that money is evil
or the cause of all the world’s ills, it will be much harder for you to welcome
money. The more you can see money as an opportunity for pleasure, sharing,
satisfaction and freedom, the easier it will come to you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I have been using magick since I was twelve
years old, and I've used just about every system and idea you can imagine. A
lot of magick worked. A lot didn't. Some magick felt amazingly real and
powerful but brought no tangible results. Other kinds of magick felt like they
couldn't possibly have worked, but brought great results. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The work presented in this book contains my
insights into the magick that worked best for me when I was still young. I know
it has worked for others. It can work for you too. It continues to work for me
today.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We’ve taken the simplest and most powerful
systems, and streamlined them into a series of steps that get money magick
working for you as fast as possible. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Magickal Cashbook works with a spirit
called Nitika, who can bring wealth. As many people have found, Nitika is an
amazing spirit, easy to contact, who brings cash fast.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Nitika is neither an angel or demon, but is
thought of as a genius spirit or ‘personified virtue.’ We think of Nitika as a
combination of angelic powers expressed through a single spirit. Nitika is a
very gentle yet powerful spirit and is listed as one of The Genii of the Twelve
Hours in the <i>Nuctemeron</i>, attributed to Apollonius of Tyana from the
First Century AD. Nitika was made known to English readers through a
translation of Éliphas Lévi’s 1897 book of <i>Transcendental Magic</i>. The
magick of Nitika has been around for a long time but remains relevant and
workable today.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many spirits can be conjured if you know
their name and sigil. Some spirits will help if you simply say their name in
the right circumstances. There is no doubt that Nitika can be conjured through
a direct call, and through the help of other magickal operations, but nothing
gives you faster contact with this spirit than the right sigil.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A sigil, or seal, as it is sometimes known,
is a drawing that gives you direct access to a spirit. This book contains the
only known copy of Nitika’s seal. This sigil cannot be found in any other
author’s book. It is like a secret key to powerful magick.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Using this sigil, and the streamlined
methods I give you, there's almost nothing to stop bursts of money coming into
your life.</span></p>
