<h1 id="heading_12_What_to_Think_and_Feel_During_the_Ritual_0"><span lang="EN-US">What to Think and Feel During the Ritual</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you're performing the ritual, and get
to Step 3, it's important to think about what you'll do with the money. Be
honest. It's absolutely vital that you don't try to be worthy or spiritual or
generous in an attempt to impress Nitika.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">当你进行仪式，到了第<span lang="EN-US">3</span>步时，重要的是要思考你将如何处理这笔钱。要诚实。绝对关键的是，不要试图为了给尼蒂卡留下好印象而表现得有价值、有灵性或慷慨。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you want $1000 to pay for a new sound
system, then that's what you want. Don't lie to yourself and Nitika by thinking
that you could give the money to charity or share it with friends. Giving is
powerful, and I'll cover it in another book, but it is not a part of what
you're doing here.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">如果你想要<span lang="EN-US">1000</span>美元买一套新的音响系统，那么这就是你想要的。不要对自己和尼蒂卡撒谎，说什么你可以把钱捐给慈善机构或与朋友分享。给予是强大的，我会在另一本书中讨论，但这并不是你在这里所做的一部分。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What you are doing is putting your emotion
into the ritual. You're not trying to appear like a good person. The spirits
don't care. Nitika doesn't care what you're going to do with the money, so long
as your desire for extra money is sincere. So if you can pass on that feeling
of sincerity during the ritual, Nitika is more likely to respond.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">你正在做的是将你的情感投入到仪式中。你不是在试图表现得像个好人。灵体们不在乎。尼蒂卡不在乎你将如何处理这笔钱，只要你对额外金钱的渴望是真诚的。所以如果你能在仪式期间传递那种真诚的感觉，尼蒂卡就更有可能回应。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Asking a spirit to help is one thing, but
showing why you are asking is quite another. So, when it gets to Step 3, think
about how good it will feel to get the money, and what you'll spend it on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">请求灵体帮助是一回事，但说明你为什么请求则是另一回事。所以，当进行到第<span lang="EN-US">3</span>步时，想想得到这笔钱并按照你想要的方式花费它会感觉有多好。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Don't worry about how the money will turn
up. This is vital. Just think about having the money and spending it in the way
you want. Enjoy the sensation as though it's happening now. It's the same
feeling you get when a relative unexpectedly hands you a wad of cash, or when
you win an unexpected prize. Get that feeling, just for a moment, and move on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">不要担心钱会如何出现。这至关重要。只想着拥有这笔钱并以你想要的方式花费它。享受那种感觉，就好像它现在正在发生一样。这就像亲戚意外地递给你一沓现金，或者你赢得意外奖品时的感觉一样。抓住那种感觉，哪怕只是一瞬间，然后继续。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Don't stress about this stage. All you're
doing is thinking about what you plan to do with the money. But be aware that
you are making a pact with Nitika. If you ask for money for a sound system </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> when unexpected money turns up, spend it on that. Nitika will then
respond more powerfully next time you ask for help. It's important to keep your
side of the bargain, unless circumstances make it impossible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">不要为这个阶段感到压力。你所做的只是思考你计划如何处理这笔钱。但要意识到你正在与尼蒂卡订立契约。如果你为音响系统要钱——当意外之财出现时，就把它花在这上面。下次你请求帮助时，尼蒂卡会更强力地回应。遵守你的承诺很重要，除非情况使之不可能。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you speak to Nitika and use words such
as 'I command thee' you should speak with authority, but not as somebody trying
to overpower the spirit. Think of the way a good manager would talk to
employees. You don't beg your workers to help, and you don't plead with them.
But nor do you order them about like an army commander.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">当你对尼蒂卡说话并使用诸如“我命令你”之类的词语时，你应该带着权威说话，但不要像试图压倒灵体的人那样。想想一个好的管理者会如何与员工交谈。你不会乞求你的员工帮助，你也不会恳求他们。但你也不会像军队指挥官那样对他们发号施令。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When it comes to magick, you are neither a
beggar or an army officer. Think of yourself as a manager. The spirits are
there to work for you. All you need to do is tell them what you want, politely,
with a tone of firm authority, and you will get what you want.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">在魔法方面，你既不是乞丐也不是军官。把自己想象成一个管理者。灵体们是来为你工作的。你所需要做的就是礼貌地、以坚定权威的口吻告诉他们你想要什么，你就会得到你想要的。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But, most importantly, a good manager is
openly grateful to employees. And the best managers show gratitude before the
job is even done. Imagine a good boss saying, 'Can you clear those back-orders
for me by lunchtime? Thanks so much.'</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">但是，最重要的是，一个好的管理者会公开感谢员工。而最好的管理者甚至在工作完成之前就表示感谢。想象一个好老板说：“你能帮我在午饭前处理完那些积压的订单吗？非常感谢。”</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you have a manager like that </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> and it's rare </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> you are far more likely to
get the job done. If the boss begs or pleads, or worse, orders you about, you
don't work as well. Spirits are like workers, and they will work for you, but
don't treat them like slaves. Just because they are there to work for you
doesn't mean you should disrespect them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">当你拥有那样的管理者时——这种情况很少见——你就更有可能完成工作。如果老板乞求或恳求，或者更糟的是，对你发号施令，你就不会那么努力工作。灵体就像工人，他们会为你工作，但不要像对待奴隶一样对待他们。仅仅因为他们是来为你工作的，并不意味着你应该不尊重他们。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Your gratitude can be genuine and heartfelt
but doesn't need to be fawning. Your gratitude is the same as a wage. It's what
a spirit expects as payment, so keep that feeling in mind when performing the
ritual.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">你的感激可以是真诚而发自内心的，但不需要阿谀奉承。你的感激就像工资一样。这是灵体期望得到的报酬，所以在进行仪式时要记住这种感觉。</p>
