Money Can You Make?</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It’s important to remember where you’re
starting from. If you’re in poverty, I will not promise that you’ll be a
millionaire. I will not promise lottery wins. I will not claim that you can
attract undreamt-of riches. To do so would be to lie, and I don’t want to trick
you. So, I will tell you the truth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I spent some time in magick forums back in
2009, reading discussions of magickal results, and I was astonished to see
people getting excited about attracting an extra $100. Some were even glad to
get just $20 through magick. This surprised me. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To me, $100 is a small amount of money. On
a good day, I could earn that in a few minutes, so why spend half an hour doing
a ritual to attract such a tiny sum?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But then I remembered that when I was poor,
in my early twenties, I would have been just as impressed by $100. The money I
make, even today, would not impress somebody much wealthier than me. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">$20,000 might be impressive to some people,
but to a multi-millionaire, that amount would not seem quite so impressive. To
a billionaire, it would seem trivial. This is why it’s important to compare
your magickal result to what you had before.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The point of this is to make sure that you
recognize the gains you make. If you are extremely poor, magick can make you
much wealthier, much faster than you expect. If you are rich, it can make money
you never dreamed possible. But each person has their own starting point. <i>Magick
builds on your starting point.</i> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If $100 is what you really need, you won't
become a millionaire this year. But if you already deal in millions, then
magick can push you to earn hundreds of millions. Please don’t fool yourself
though – if you are on a low income, you are highly unlikely to earn great
wealth quickly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The great news is that if you're starting
from a low income, you can use magick to build your wealth steadily. Each time
you use magick, you can take a financial leap. And the first steps you take
will bring a surprising amount of money. We have seen this happen to so many
people who have used this book.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Getting to a place that you now think of as
'rich' will take time, but it will take less time than you can imagine. One
thing is certain, if you <i>don't</i> use magick, you are highly unlikely to
break out of your current financial state. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We love stories about people who rise from
rags to riches, and it's true that people can use talent, skill and hard work
to make that leap. But for most people, the most likely thing is that - no
matter how hard you work - you stay in the same financial zone. Magick can push
you out of that zone</span></p>
