Think and Feel During the Ritual</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you’re performing the ritual, and get
to Step 3, it’s important to think about what you’ll <i>do</i> with the money.
Be honest. It’s absolutely vital that you don’t try to be worthy or spiritual
or generous in an attempt to impress Nitika.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you want $1000 to pay for a new sound
system, then that’s what you want. Don’t lie to yourself and Nitika by thinking
that you could give the money to charity or share it with friends. Giving is
powerful, and I’ll cover it in another book, but it is not a part of what
you’re doing here.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What you are doing is putting your emotion
into the ritual. You’re not trying to appear like a good person. The spirits
don’t care. Nitika doesn’t care what you’re going to do with the money, so long
as your desire for extra money is <i>sincere</i>. So if you can pass on that
feeling of sincerity during the ritual, Nitika is more likely to respond.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Asking a spirit to help is one thing, but
showing <i>why</i> you are asking is quite another. So, when it gets to Step 3,
think about how good it will feel to get the money, and what you’ll spend it
on. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Don’t worry about how the money will turn
up. This is vital. Just think about having the money and spending it in the way
you want. Enjoy the sensation as though it’s happening now. It’s the same
feeling you get when a relative unexpectedly hands you a wad of cash, or when
you win an unexpected prize. Get that <i>feeling</i>, just for a moment, and
move on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Don’t stress about this stage. All you’re
doing is thinking about what you plan to do with the money. But be aware that
you are making a pact with Nitika. If you ask for money for a sound system –
when unexpected money turns up, spend it on that. Nitika will then respond more
powerfully next time you ask for help. It’s important to keep your side of the
bargain, unless circumstances make it impossible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you speak to Nitika and use words such
as ‘I command thee’ you should speak with authority, but not as somebody trying
to overpower the spirit. Think of the way a good manager would talk to
employees. You don’t beg your workers to help, and you don’t plead with them.
But nor do you order them about like an army commander. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When it comes to magick, you are neither a
beggar or an army officer. Think of yourself as a manager. The spirits are
there to work for you. All you need to do is tell them what you want, politely,
with a tone of firm authority, and you will get what you want.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But, most importantly, a good manager is
openly grateful to employees. And the best managers show gratitude before the
job is even done. Imagine a good boss saying, ‘Can you clear those back-orders
for me by lunchtime? Thanks so much.’ </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you have a manager like that – and
it’s rare – you are far more likely to get the job done. If the boss begs or
pleads, or worse, orders you about, you don’t work as well. Spirits are like
workers, and they will work for you, but don’t treat them like slaves. Just
because they are there to work for you doesn’t mean you should disrespect them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Your gratitude can be genuine and heartfelt
but doesn’t need to be fawning. Your gratitude is the same as a wage. It’s what
a spirit expects as payment, so keep that feeling in mind when performing the
ritual.</span></p>
