Your Cashbook to Attract Money</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now that your Cashbook has been empowered,
you need to learn the basic ritual for using it. Here’s exactly what you do
during the Attraction Ritual.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Perform this Attraction Ritual once a
day, at any time of day. If you miss a day, it’s not the end of the world, but
aim for eleven consecutive days. This shows commitment. If <i>you</i>
demonstrate commitment, so will Nitika. If you don’t find the time, why should
Nitika bother? If the money turns up before the eleven days are over, you can
end the ritual, of course.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Sit in a quiet place where you won’t be
disturbed. Open your book and vibrate the words NAH-KAH EE-AH-OH-EH over and
over until you feel a sense of calm come over you. If you feel nothing, don’t
worry, just stay relaxed and move onto the next step.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Close the book and gaze at the sigil of
Nitika on the cover. Think of the amount of money you want to create. Most
importantly, think about what you’ll <i>do</i> with this money. (See the next
chapter for precise details on this point.) When you’ve got the feeling of the
money you want to attract, vibrate the name Nitika <i>three</i> times while
looking at the sigil.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">4. Open the book and vibrate NAH-KAH
EE-AH-OH-EH one more time, and then read out the first part of the invocation,
starting with, ‘Nitika. Nitika. Nitika. In the name…’ using the pronunciations
that you have learned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you get to the small circle that you
drew, stop.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">5. Turn to the <i>next blank page</i> in
your book and write the amount you want to attract. In this example, it is $50,
but you should choose an amount that’s right for you. Write $50 and put a
circle around it. Use this same page each day, adding another circle each time
you perform the ritual. (If you use a different currency, write down that
currency.) After three days, it would look something like this:</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img alt="Image" height="272" src="img/image006.jpg" width="368"/><br clear="ALL"/>
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">6. Now turn back to the first page and read
everything that follows the small circle, starting with, ‘I command thee…’</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">7. When you have finished reading, close
the book, put it away and do something else.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">8. Remember what was said about <i>lust for
result</i>. It’s almost impossible to stop thinking about your ritual, but it
helps if you do something involving, such as making and eating food, going out,
singing, calling somebody, or anything that involves physical exercise. If you
find yourself dwelling on the ritual, remember to feel grateful for the result.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">That’s it. Repeat each day. It might take a
day or two for results to show up. It might take eleven days. It might take
longer, but the money will turn up. It may turn up in a highly unexpected way.
The more patient and relaxed you are, the more likely it is that the money will
come.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Don’t wait for it or look for it, but be
glad when it does arrive. <i>If it doesn’t arrive when you want it to, don’t
write the ritual off as a failure.</i> Know that it may yet manifest. When the
eleven days are over, you can start a new ritual for a different amount.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you do see the money turn up, know
that the magick has worked (even if it’s not the exact amount you asked for).
Go back to your Cashbook, turn to the page where you wrote the amount of money
you were seeking, and draw a cross through each circle where you wrote the
amount. As you do so, feel gratitude. When you feel gratitude, you are paying
the spirit back with your emotions, and that makes for good future relations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If nothing seems to have happened after
eleven days, cross everything out on the money page, feeling grateful for your
result (<i>as though it really has happened</i>) and start a fresh page as soon
as you’re ready. Starting a new ritual can help you to forget about the
previous one, which opens the doorway to success.</span></p>
