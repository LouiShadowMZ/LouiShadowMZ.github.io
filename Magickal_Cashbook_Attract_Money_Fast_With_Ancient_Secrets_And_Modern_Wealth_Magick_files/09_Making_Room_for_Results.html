for Results</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Read any book on magick, and you will find
one theme that comes up over and over again<i>; lust for result</i>. It is said
that if you lust desperately for results, then you will not get them. But this
is a strange irony because if you go to the trouble of performing magick, it
must be because you <i>want</i> the results. So how do you let go of this lust?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many people perform their magick and then
try their best to forget the result they want. While it is true that this
‘letting go’ will bring results fast, it is not easy to achieve. And when the
magickal result is important to you, forgetting the result is almost impossible
to achieve.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here’s what often happens. Somebody
performs a spell or ritual. Let’s say the result they want is to sell their
novel to a particular publisher. They send off the novel, and as the weeks go
by, they can’t stop thinking about selling their novel. So, every day they
check their email, fantasize about signing books at a bookshop, or feel
startled when the phone rings, hoping it just might be the publisher. This is a
classic case of lusting after the result, and it not only short-circuits the
magick, but it can cause the magick to work in reverse. You’re pestering the
magick instead of giving it the freedom to work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sadly, many people deal with their lust for
result with a form of panic. Let’s take the above example. Our writer sends the
novel off to the publisher. A few days later, the thought occurs that it would
be great to sell that novel. In a panic, knowing that lust for result might
ruin the working, our writer tries not to think about the novel or the magick.
For the following weeks, huge amounts of mental energy are exerted on <i>pretending</i>
there is no desire.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You’re not fooling anybody when this
happens. Your desire is real. And lust can, in fact, be a powerful force for
manifestation, but that is a subject for another book. For now, you need to
deal with your desires practically to prevent a magickal short circuit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">Lust for result</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> is a challenge, but there is no need to pretend you have no desire.
Here is a way to beat your <i>lust for result</i>. Every time you remember your
magick or the result you want, feel glad that you remembered, and imagine how
good it will feel when the magickal result comes to pass. Imagine that the
result has <i>already</i> happened and that you feel <i>relief</i>. That’s all
there is to it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Read that paragraph again and again if you
need to. When your desire comes into your mind, let yourself feel relief, as
though you already have what you want. That defuses the lust. Your desire is
still there, it’s still real and strong, but this is the opposite of hoping or
wishing. It takes some mental energy, but rather than trying to suppress or
hide thoughts and feelings, you modify them slightly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you have trouble feeling good about your
desire, here’s a powerful trick. Think of a memory or image that makes you feel
good, happy or grateful. It doesn’t matter what you use but think of something
that creates a potent emotion. The moment you remember your magick or the
magickal result you are seeking, conjure up this memory, feel the positive
emotion, and then continue to think about your result.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Don’t avoid your result. Feel free to think
about it. Feel good that the result has come to pass. Even though a part of you
knows the result hasn’t occurred yet, imagine that it <i>has</i> occurred, and
imagine what it feels like to have the result and to be grateful for it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you find yourself wondering about <i>how</i>
it will work, or <i>why</i> it will work, or <i>when</i> it will work – that is
lust for result. If that happens, then you need to busy yourself to stop this
rush of thoughts. Pondering on magickal results is a form of doubt, and is best
avoided. The more patient you are, the faster results will come.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But don’t worry about <i>lust for result</i>.
Feel free to think about the result you want, but think about it with a warm
glow.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Never waste your time worrying about when
results will come, how fast they will come, or in what form they will arrive.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This last point is a very important one.
Sometimes magick requires us to be specific. If you want to stop an enemy, you
bind that specific person. That can be more powerful than if you put out a
general protection spell. So being specific can be hugely powerful. In more
general magick, though, it can be a mistake to be too specific. If you perform
a spell to make money by getting a raise, and that’s the <i>only</i> way you
want the money to come, you are cutting yourself off from other opportunities.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The universe, or the spirits, can probably
think of a thousand better ways to get money to you, so let it come in <i>whatever
form it wants</i>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Be open to new avenues of income, and the
income will flow.</span></p>
