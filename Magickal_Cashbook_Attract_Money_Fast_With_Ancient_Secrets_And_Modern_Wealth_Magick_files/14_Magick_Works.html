the way you expect. I once performed an elaborate ritual to find a low-cost
house, and as soon as it was done a relative offered to sell me a house with
$100,000 knocked off the price. Not what I expected, but a result, and a good
result at that. So be aware of money turning up in unexpected ways. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But what if it doesn’t work? You may have
asked for too much or too little, or you may just need more practice.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A good trick to get the magick working is
this: use the Cashbook to attract something really small, but incredibly
specific. So, if you need $500, just forget that for now. Instead, try
requesting an obscure amount such as 50c or $3. Something that feels so easy
it’s almost pointless to do magick for.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This works, because it’s such a small
amount, and then your disbelief falls away. You let go of all lust for result,
because who cares about 50c anyway? But when this specific amount turns up out
of the blue, within a few days, it lets you know that magick works. Even though
it’s for a tiny amount, it gives you more trust in the magick. It’s an easy and
fun way to get things started but think of it as an enjoyable way to do magick,
rather than that you are testing the magick. The moment you test magick, you’re
lacking trust, and that can short-circuit everything. (Remember also that the
Cashbook often throws in a little extra on top of what you request. So, if you
ask for a very specific $3, don’t be surprised if you get $3.30.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Cashbook works well for most people if
the instructions are followed closely, but if you’re having trouble getting
started, give this a try and it should get things flowing. Money finds a way.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you want huge changes in your financial
circumstances, where your focus is on building a career that generates extreme
wealth, look into my book <i>Magickal Riches</i>. That is a much more involved
text, but it works if you want to take wealth magick to the next level.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The magick in this book works easily for
most people, but if you find it difficult, The Gallery of Magick website and
blog contains many FAQs, along with advice and practical information that is
updated on a regular basis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">www.galleryofmagick.com</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">The Gallery of Magick</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> Facebook page will also keep you up to date.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you have an interest in developing your
magick further, there are many texts that can assist you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">Words of Power</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> and <i>The Greater Words of Power</i> present an extremely simple
ritual practice, for bringing about change in yourself and others, as well as
directing and attracting changed circumstances.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">Magickal Protection</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> contains rituals that can be directed at specific problems, as well
as a daily practice called The Sword Banishing, which is one of our most
popular and effective rituals.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For those who cannot find peace through
protection, there is <i>Magickal Attack</i>, by Gordon Winterfield. Gordon has
also written Demons of Magick, a comprehensive guide to working safely with
demonic power. Dark magick is not to everybody’s taste, but this is a highly
moral approach that puts the emphasis on using personal sincerity. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For those seeking more money, <i>Magickal
Riches</i> is comprehensive, with rituals for everything from gambling to
sales, with a master ritual to oversee magickal income. For the more ambitious,
<i>Wealth Magick</i> contains a complex set of rituals for earning money by
building a career. For those still trying to find their feet, there is <i>The
Magickal Job Seeker.</i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">The 72 Sigils of Power</span></i><span lang="EN-US">, by Zanna Blaise, covers Contemplation Magic (for insight and
wisdom) and Results Magic (for changing the world around you). Zanna is also
the author of <i>The Angels of Love</i>, which uses a tasking method with six
angels to heal relationships or to attract a soulmate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">Magickal Seduction</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> is a text that looks at attracting others by using magick to
amplify your attractive qualities, rather than through deception. <i>Adventures
in Sex Magick</i> is a more specialized text, for those open-minded enough to
explore this somewhat extreme form of magick.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">The Master Works of Chaos Magick</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> by Adam Blackthorne is an overview of self-directed and creative
magick, which also includes a section covering the Olympic Spirits. <i>Magickal
Servitors</i> takes another aspect of Chaos Magick and updates it into a
modern, workable method.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-US">The 72 Angels of Magick</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> is our most comprehensive book of angel magick and explores
hundreds of powers that can be applied by working with these angels. <i>The
Angels of Alchemy </i>works with 42 angels, to obtain personal transformation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Our most successful book is <i>Sigils of
Power and Transformation</i> by Adam Blackthorne, which has brought great
results to many people. <i>Archangels of Magick</i> by Damon Brand is the most
complete book of magick we have published, covering sigils, divination,
invocation, and evocation.</span></p>
