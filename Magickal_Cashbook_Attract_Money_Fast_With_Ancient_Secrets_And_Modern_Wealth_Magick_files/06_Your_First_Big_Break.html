<h1 id="heading_06_Your_First_Big_Break_0"><span lang="EN-US">Your First Big Break</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Decide now, what amount will be impressive,
unexpected and exciting to you. If $20 would excite you, be honest, and say you
want $20. If you'd be amazed by $1000, that's also fine. If you're already
wealthy, and wouldn't be impressed unless you make $100,000 of extra income out
of the blue, then you need to be certain of that too.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">现在决定，什么金额对你来说是令人印象深刻、出乎意料和令人兴奋的。如果<span lang="EN-US">20</span>美元会让你兴奋，那就诚实地说你想要<span lang="EN-US">20</span>美元。如果你会被<span lang="EN-US">1000</span>美元惊艳到，那也很好。如果你已经很富有，除非凭空多出<span lang="EN-US">10</span>万美元的额外收入，否则不会被打动，那么你也需要确定这一点。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The reason for this is that money will turn
up when you make your Magical Cashbook. When it does, I want you to know that
the magick worked.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">原因是当你制作你的魔法现金簿时，金钱就会出现。当它出现时，我希望你知道魔法起作用了。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sometimes, you might find a monthly expense
is $50 less than expected. That's a result. Sometimes you might find $20
stuffed down the side of a chair. That's a result. Or you might get a promotion
or a bonus. And there are hundreds, if not thousands, of creative ways that
magick can provide the money. Don't expect the money to come in a particular
way. Let it come in any way, at any speed, and then it will come fast and
creatively.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">有时候，你可能会发现每月的开销比预期少了<span lang="EN-US">50</span>美元。这是一个结果。有时候你可能会在椅子缝里找到<span lang="EN-US">20</span>美元。这也是一个结果。或者你可能会得到升职或奖金。魔法提供金钱的方式有成百上千种，甚至更多。不要期望金钱以特定的方式到来。让它以任何方式、任何速度到来，然后它就会迅速而富有创意地到来。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It would be sad if you dismissed the
magick, and said, 'Oh, that's just a coincidence.' In reality, it is usually a
series of chance events and encounters that lead to magickal success. So when
you see coincidence, welcome it and know that the magick helped. The more
grateful you feel for your results, the more likely you are to get them in the
future.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">如果你把魔法斥为“哦，那只是个巧合”，那就太可惜了。实际上，通常是一系列偶然事件和巧遇导致了魔法的成功。所以当你看到巧合时，欢迎它，并知道魔法起到了帮助作用。你对结果越感激，将来就越有可能得到它们。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Decide now what amount would convince you
that magick is real, and then write it down somewhere secret. If this amount
turns up, you know you can trust this book to help you, and you can keep using
magick.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">现在决定什么金额能让你相信魔法是真实的，然后把它秘密地写在某个地方。如果这个金额出现了，你就知道可以相信这本书能帮助你，你可以继续使用魔法。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Magick usually makes you a little bit more
money than you think is possible. You need to consider that statement
carefully.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">魔法通常会让你赚到比你认为可能的多一点点的钱。你需要仔细思考这句话。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you'd be excited by $100, then you'll
probably make slightly more than that on your first attempt at making money
with magick. And if you need $50,000, then that's what you'll get, and perhaps
a little bit more. If $50 would be a true thrill, you should make more than
$50.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">如果你会为<span lang="EN-US">100</span>美元而兴奋，那么你第一次尝试用魔法赚钱时，可能会赚到比这略多一点的钱。如果你需要<span lang="EN-US">50,000</span>美元，那么你就会得到这些，或许还会多一点。如果<span lang="EN-US">50</span>美元会让你真正激动，你应该能赚到超过<span lang="EN-US">50</span>美元。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But if you're the sort of person who's in
true poverty, and if $100 is a big deal to you, I will not lie and say you can
win the lottery or make $50,000 out of nowhere. You can get there eventually.
You can get there faster than you thought possible. But expect your own
personal surprise and an amount of money that is meaningful to you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">但是，如果你是那种真正贫困的人，如果<span lang="EN-US">100</span>美元对你来说是件大事，我不会撒谎说你能中彩票或凭空赚到<span lang="EN-US">50,000</span>美元。你最终可以达到那个目标。你可以比你想象的更快达到。但是，期待你自己的惊喜和对你来说有意义的金额。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">One problem with most money magick is that
it takes time to work. The Magickal Cashbook works fast. You can get some money
quickly, almost instantly. Then you can use the rituals to attract steady
income and bursts of money. But it's really important that you don't insist
that it works fast. You need to let the results come when they come, in
whatever way they come. I've often said if you can wait a year for something,
magick makes it happen instantly, but if you insist it happens instantly, you
might have to wait a year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">大多数金钱魔法的一个问题是它需要时间才能起作用。《魔法现金簿》起效很快。你可以很快得到一些钱，几乎是即刻。然后你可以使用仪式来吸引稳定的收入和意外之财。但非常重要的是，你不要坚持它必须快速起作用。你需要让结果在它们该来的时候，以它们该有的方式到来。我经常说，如果你能为某件事等待一年，魔法会让它瞬间发生，但如果你坚持它必须瞬间发生，你可能不得不等待一年。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can work on this, by learning patience.
The more patient you are, the faster you get what you want. If you don't get
what you want the first time, keep going, knowing that magick is real. That
sort of trust and involvement with magick is so much more powerful than doing
one ritual and hoping for a big result. Magick is not about hope, but about
shaping your reality.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">你可以通过学习耐心来改善这一点。你越有耐心，就越快得到你想要的。如果第一次没有得到你想要的，继续下去，相信魔法是真实的。那种对魔法的信任和投入，远比做一次仪式并期望获得巨大成果要强大得多。魔法不是关于希望，而是关于塑造你的现实。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you want to win the lottery, that's
quite normal, most people do. But if you're serious about making more money,
I'd advise you to give up the lottery altogether. When you give up random
gambling, you're sending a message out to the universe that you trust that
money will turn up. That is way more powerful than hoping for a win.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">如果你想中彩票，这很正常，大多数人都想。但如果你是认真想赚更多钱，我建议你完全放弃彩票。当你放弃随机赌博时，你是在向宇宙发出一个信息，即你相信金钱会出现。这远比希望中奖强大得多。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also, I have to be upfront and say that
most people find magick doesn't work for lotteries. Magick is only one way of
influencing the world, and when you enter a lottery, you are up against the
powers of random effects and astronomical odds. Even the strongest ritual will
struggle to change the way those numbers fall.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">而且，我必须坦诚地说，大多数人发现魔法对彩票不起作用。魔法只是影响世界的一种方式，当你购买彩票时，你面对的是随机效应和天文数字般的赔率。即使是最强大的仪式也很难改变那些数字的出现方式。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A more successful approach is to use magick
to guess the correct numbers in advance. That way, you're not trying to
influence the fall of numbers itself - you're merely trying to use magick to select
the right numbers for yourself. But magick is more fun than a lottery win. When
you see money conjure its way into your life on a regular basis, you don't need
a lottery win. When you feel comfortable with that, the magick will work even
faster.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">一种更成功的方法是使用魔法来预先猜出正确的号码。那样，你不是试图影响数字本身的掉落——你只是试图使用魔法为自己选择正确的号码。但魔法比中彩票更有趣。当你看到金钱定期地被召唤到你的生活中时，你就不需要中彩票了。当你对此感到自在时，魔法会更快地起作用。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since this book was first published in
2014, there's one story that I've been told over and over again. Somebody does
their first ritual and asks for $5000 or $1000 or something that is way out of
reach for them. Nothing happens. They give up. But then a few months later they
try again, and they try for something that is just out of reach, and it works </span>–<span lang="EN-US"> maybe $20 maybe $200 - and then all the rituals begin to work.
Consider this carefully, and avoid desperation and demanding too much. Seek
what would be exciting for you, but not an absurd amount. If you build
steadily, you get to a place of riches much faster than if you demand riches
right now.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">自从这本书于<span lang="EN-US">2014</span>年首次出版以来，有一个故事我被反复告知。有人做了他们的第一个仪式，要求<span lang="EN-US">5000</span>美元或<span lang="EN-US">1000</span>美元，或者一些对他们来说遥不可及的金额。什么也没发生。他们放弃了。但几个月后他们又试了一次，他们尝试了一些仅仅是略微超出他们能力范围的东西，结果成功了——可能是<span lang="EN-US">20</span>美元，也可能是<span lang="EN-US">200</span>美元——然后所有的仪式都开始起作用了。仔细考虑这一点，避免绝望和要求过多。寻求那些会让你兴奋，但又不是荒谬的金额。如果你稳步积累，你会比现在就要求财富更快地到达富裕的境地。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It's true that there are stories online and
in reviews where people have made thousands in a few days, with the Magickal
Cashbook, and others even more, but don't let the big success stories put you
off from starting small. You may get a pleasant surprise, and more than you
hoped for, but be willing to build gradually. The big amounts come to those
with natural magickal abilities and a high level of patience. It can take time
to build those skills, so go in with an open mind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">的确，网上和评论中都有故事说，有人用魔法现金簿在几天内赚了几千美元，甚至更多，但不要让那些巨大的成功故事阻止你从小处着手。你可能会得到一个惊喜，得到比你希望的更多，但要愿意逐步积累。巨额财富会降临到那些具有天生魔法能力和高度耐心的人身上。培养这些技能可能需要时间，所以要以开放的心态去尝试。</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although your mind should be open, try to
avoid testing the magick. If you perform it as an experiment to see if it will
work and then stare at your watch waiting for a result, I know it will not
work. Perform it as though it is real, and assume it will work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">虽然你的思想应该开放，但尽量避免测试魔法。如果你把它当作一个实验来执行，看看它是否会起作用，然后盯着手表等待结果，我知道它不会起作用。把它当作真实的事情来执行，并假设它会起作用。</p>
