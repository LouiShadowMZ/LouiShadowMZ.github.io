that you will want to adapt these methods. That is good because nothing is more
powerful than your own, personal magick. But to begin with, follow the
instructions as set out and you will get the best results.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also, try to be quite casual about the
instructions. That is, follow them closely, but don’t worry too much about
getting things perfectly correct. If you mess up a little, it still tends to
work. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I am constantly astonished by endless
discussions about how to pronounce Words of Power, how to enact a certain
ritual, and so on. People worry about magick, rather than getting on with it.
If you do the magick as instructed, with clear intent, it will create the
correct state of mind, and then results will follow.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you go to start your car in the
morning, you don’t hope and pray that it will start. You don’t need faith or
belief. You just expect that your car will start and it usually does. The same
approach works with magick.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You may wonder if you really need to make
the Cashbook. Yes, you do. I know that many people don’t want to make the
Cashbook, because who wants a strange little magick book lying around their
house, covered in magickal sigils? Wouldn’t it be easier just to chant a spell?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When you make something in the real world,
the magick is often more likely to manifest in the real world. You are creating
something in the physical world and charging it with magickal power. That has a
strong effect.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The magickal book is easy to make and easy
to hide, and it’s best to keep it away from prying eyes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There are many articles on The Gallery of
Magick website to help you get the magick working if you encounter any problems
at all. The main message is to be relaxed and casual about your magick. But it
is worth reading everything that’s on there. We’ve put the equivalent of three
books worth of information on the website, and it’s all free. You can learn a
lot about magick.</span></p>
