Your Magickal Cashbook</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Buy a notebook. It’s that easy. You could
spend hours making your own notebook out of fresh parchment, gluing it together
with traditional binding methods, but it’s far quicker to buy a notebook. It
will work well.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you can buy something that looks or
feels vaguely magickal to you, so much the better, but it isn’t vital. Ideally,
there should be no lines on the paper, but again, it is not vital. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You should paint the front cover gray or
silver, and paint the back cover orange. You can stick on card or paper if it’s
easier. You can do this using cheap paints and a basic brush. You can get what
you need at an art shop or just look for something cheap around town. Nothing
fancy is required. These colors act almost like a battery, drawing magickal
energy through the book when you perform the ritual.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The only problem you will face is that it
may take several coats of paint to cover up the writing and logos on the cover.
If that’s what it takes, then keep going until all you have are clear gray and
orange covers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A shortcut is to glue white paper or card
onto the cover of your notebook, and then paint that, or use colored card or
paper. It doesn’t have to be too special. The inside of the cover does not need
to be colored.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You may have a thousand questions about the
notebook - what size, what style of binding, what weight and so on. Really, you
don’t need to worry. So long as you have a notebook of some kind, with pages to
write on, and a gray cover, with an orange back cover, the magick will work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the front cover, you will need a copy of
the following sigil. It can be drawn by hand, photocopied or printed out from
the website.</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img alt="Image" height="356" src="img/image002.jpg" width="356"/><br clear="ALL"/>
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For most people, drawing is out of the
question, so it’s completely OK to photocopy it from the book. If you’re using
the e-book, then you can download the image and print it out, or even
photograph the e-book and print that out. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can find the image here:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">http://galleryofmagick.com/images/</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can stick the printout on the front of
your Cashbook, and that will do fine. You might want to trace over the printed
image, lightly, with a pen or pencil, to connect yourself to the sigil. It
might look something like this:</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img alt="Image" height="270" src="img/image003.jpg" width="362"/><br clear="ALL"/>
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you have the confidence, you can draw
this as it’s shown above. Use pen, pencil, or any kind of ink. As a rule, it’s
best to use black ink or dark pencil.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Copying the Hebrew words might take some
practice if you’re not used to writing in Hebrew. Practice on blank paper
first. But even if you make a bit of a mess, it doesn’t matter, because you
will soon perform a brief ritual that dedicates the book to Nitika.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you cannot copy exactly, don’t worry. If
you get the basic shapes of the letters right, it will work. And if you prefer
to print out or photocopy, that is also fine, but it does help if you then take
the time to draw lightly over the image with a pencil or pen, to connect
yourself to the shapes and images. You do not need to be able to understand the
various divine names and words of power, so long as you can see them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the orange back cover draw or glue a
copy of this sigil:</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img alt="Image" height="258" src="img/image004.jpg" width="354"/><br clear="ALL"/>
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This should again be drawn using black ink,
pencil or pen, or feel free to use a printout. Once again, if you use a
photocopy or printout, take the time to trace over the lines lightly with a pen
or pencil. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Open your book and on the first blank page
of the book write the following words of power:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">NAH-KAH
EE-AH-OH-EH</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These words of power are a statement that
means it is your will to recognize God, and this gives you the authority to
work the magick.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Once you have written that down, say the
words out loud. The AH sound appears in a lot of these words, and this AH is
like the <i>a</i> in <i>father</i>. The words are pronounced as follows. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">NAH sounds like <i>ah</i> with <i>n</i> at
the front.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">KAH sounds like <i>ah </i>with <i>k</i> at
the front.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">EE sounds like <i>me</i> without the <i>m</i>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">AH is the word <i>ah</i>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">OH is the word <i>oh</i>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">EH sounds like <i>yeah</i> without the <i>y</i>.
</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Accurate pronunciation is not important,
but I know people worry about it, so I’m making it as clear as possible.
Remember that a bold and confident attitude is far more important than correct
pronunciation. If you need more details, you can find them on the <i>Pronunciation
and Spelling FAQ</i> page at www.galleryofmagick.com where there’s a video
showing you exactly how to say the words.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You’ve now built your Magickal Cashbook,
and all you need to do is empower it. Then you can begin to write your
petitions in the book to manifest money.</span></p>
