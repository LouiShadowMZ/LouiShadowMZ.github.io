	<p class="block_4">Let me first of all furnish the translation of various textbooks on Horary Astrology written by
		Hindu sages., before I put forth my discovery. The readers should also know what the Westerners have propounded.

	<h3 id="id_Toc184334371" class="block_12">Prasna Gyana</h3>
	<p class="block_4">Bhattotpala is the author of this work. He had commented on Varaha Mihira's works and this text
		deals with one of the branches of Astrology called Horary Astrology.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Text-books of our sages can give only the fundamental principles. The result entirely depends on
		the intelligent anticipation by proper application and interpretation by the astrologer without taking into
		consideration one's desire. Wishful thoughts and guess will prove to be useless.</p>

	<p class="block_4">Sloka 1: Bhottotpala bows to all the seven planets, Sun. Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and
		Saturn: Then he prays to Lord Ganapathi. He brings out for the benefit of the readers astrologers-this science
		Prasna Gyana.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Sloka 2: He boldly declares that Horary Astrology will never fail. He expects the astrologers to
		carefully judge the ten conditions of the planets after casting their exact position.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The ten conditions of the planets are given in Jataka Parijata and their results are explained in
		Saravali.</p>

	<p class="block_16">Planets in their own sign indicate pleasure, happiness, wealth like gold, gems, etc. and one can
		have servants at command.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(Planets in its own sign equally causes miseries and do harm also; it is not a guarantee that
		such a planet should invariably do good. It depends on the lord of the constellation and the lord of the sub.)
	</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(c) Pramudhita: Satisfied, contented: A planet is said to be satisfied when it occupies its
		friend's quarters. One can find out the friend's quarters by using the following:</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Swa, Swanthya, Dhi, Dharma, Swechcha, Ayu, Sukha, L.e.. count from the Moolatrikona sign of the
		planet whose friendly sign is to be found. The first, second, twelfth, fifth, ninth, exaltation sign eighth and
		fourth counted from the Moolatrikona signs are the friendly signs. The other signs are said to be enemical,
		i.e., 3, 6, 10, 11 and 7. One can easily remember that the seventh and the upachaya Sthanas counted from
		Moolatri- kona signs are not friendly ones. The lords of the friendly signs are called the friends of the
		planet; the lords of the signs 3, 6, 10, 11 and 7 are said to be the enemy of that planet. It may happen that
		one of the two signs owned by a planet is friendly and the other is enemical.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The authors say that such a planet owning both the friendly and enemical signs should be
		considered as neutral, e.g. take Sun. Its Moolatrikona sign is Leo. Therefore Mercury owning Gemini and Virgo
		becomes the lord of the 11th and the second sign counted from Sun's Moolatrikona sign. 11th is enemical. 2nd is
		friendly. So Mercury is neutral to Sun; 3rd sign Libra is owned by Venus which also rules Taurus the 10th sign
		from Leo, the Moolatrikona of sign of Sun, Leo. As the 3 and 10 are enemicals Venus is the enemy of Sun. Take
		the 4th sign Scorpio. It is owned by Mars who also governs Aries, the 9th sign. Therefore Mars is friendly with
		Sun. Thus one is to find out the friendship, enmity and neutral condition of the planets.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Such a planet causes contentment; it offers peace; it is also said that one may have damsels,
		riches like gems and precious metals, enjoy one's life and come out successful in one's enterprise and
		victorious in the disputes. (Just like friends turn out to be rogues causing danger to the person, so also
		planets in friend's quarters offer undesirable results to many.) </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(d) Santha: Calm, tranquil; If a planet is in the Varga of a benefic, it is said to be Santha';
		by Benefics, one is to mean benefics by nature, i.e. Jupiter, Venus, Waxing Moon, and unafflicted Mercury. Such
		a planet in Santha condition shows that the person will be helpful. He or she will do meritorious deeds. They
		will be educated and learned. They can become advisers and ministers. Hence they can enjoy life with enough
		financial position and have peace. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(e) Saktha: Capable, competent, efficient. A planet is in Saktha condition, if it is not Moudya,
		Mooda and eclipsed but is with bright rays. Such a planet will bring one name, fame, reputation, honour etc. He
		will be liked by all. He or she has enough friends of the opposite sex; so he or she puts on good clothes, uses
		flower and fragrant scents (not a guarantee). </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(f) Prapeditha: Troubled tormented. A planet is said to be in Prapeeditha, if it is defeated by
		another planet in the fight among themselves. Such a planet causes separation from close relatives and friends;
		he or she may wander from one place to the other (frequent transfers, keeping the family in any one place);
		suffer in the hands of the enemies or from ill-health. Thus he or she will be miserable, even a king will suffer
		(not always). </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(g) "Dheena" Unhappy, timid worried, miserable. planet is said to be in Dheena conditions if
		either in Rasi Kundali or in Navamsa Kundali, it occupies its enemy's quarters; such a planet threatens loss of
		one's position, prestige and honour. The person is defeated. He is ruined. He goes to foreign places: cannot
		keep himself clean (not in all cases). </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(h) "Kala" —— cruel —— wicked —— A planet is in 'kala' condition when it occupies either in Rasi
		kundali or Navamsa kundali, the sign belonging to any of the natural malefics, Sun, waning Moon, Mars, afflicted
		Mercury or Saturn. Such a planet always contributes for one's miserable life. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(i) "Vikala" —— unsteady, infirm, such a condition arises when a planet is eclipsed. (Saturn and
		Venus do not lose strength even when eclipsed. Uthrakalamirtha, kanda IV sloka —— 15), loss of wealth,
		separation from partner, mentally worried, enemy's strength much greater and enemy becoming more powerful,
		agony, etc., are threatened</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(j) "Bheedhi", fear, threatening, frightened. A planet attains the condition of Bheedhi" in its
		Neecha, debilitated i.c., depression sign. Such a planet makes one diffident. There is no self-confidence. He is
		afraid by anything and everything. Loss of all kinds are portended. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(Neecha Banga Raja Yoga: Venus, friend of Mercury, neecha in Mercury's sign. Venus, enemy of
		Jupiter is exalted in Jupiter sign: Moon, enemy of Venus exalted in Venus sign. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 3: The astrologer should start his work only after bowing to the planets. He must worship,
		when truth will to dawn in his mind. Then commence to judge the query</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">The querist has to sit facing cast or north or north-east. He should avoid taking such a seat,
		facing west, south-west, north-west, south, and south-east directions.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Varahamihira in Brihat Samhita has advised the astrologer to take seat in an even ground under a
		tree with flowers or fruits; he has to avoid such trees where owls and such bad omen birds take rest; the name
		of the tree itself should be encouraging offering mental solace. Or one should prefer Deva, Rishi Twiya. Siddha
		or Sadhu Nilayam with Sath pushyam, i.e.. the temple, the Ashram of Maharishis. the residences of Brahmins, the
		places of Siddha Purushas or good Sadhus where there are planets with beautiful and sweet smelling flowers etc.
		Why? The sight itself should be pleasing to the eyes. Lawn is preferred. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 4: The consultant also should pray with fruits, flowers, gems and gold; then only, come
		out with his problems and put queries to the astrologer.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Avoid taking seat under a tree which is cut or which is thorny. Avoid graveyards, neglected
		temples, junction of the roads, dirty places, and dry barren ground. Reject such places where persons remain
		naked, or saloon, slaugher house gambling den, hospitals, prison or honey store room.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Why because one can have favourable results if the consultant faces east. If he faces south or
		north, journey is indicated. South-west and north-east show that there is long delay in achieving one's aim.
		North-west and south-east threaten failure, disappointment or temporary pleasure.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Regarding west, in Prasna Bairava it is taken as auspicious whereas Varahamihira advises to
		avoid west.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Both the astrologer and the consultant must prefer the morning hours to the afternoon the
		Santhyakala, twilight period and the nights. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Neelakanta suggests that the astrologer should check whether the consultant has approached him
		with the sincere idea of placing his problems and then requesting the astrologer to solve them or he has come to
		test him or put some questions casually. This can be judged by finding out whether the lagna that is rising in
		the east is occupied by Moon, squared or opposed by Saturn, or opposed by Mercury or aspected by Mars and
		Mercury in moudyam, i.e. eclipsed. If the ascendant, at the moment of query, has such afflictions, the
		consultant is not sincere. Benefics in the Lagna Bhava denotes that he is true and he has the real urge.
		Malefics in the lagna indicates that he is not plain and open. If lord of the 7th cusp receives aspects from its
		enemy or Jupiter or Mercury he is crooked and not straightforward. But if the 7th house as well as lagna receive
		aspects from either Moon or Mercury or Jupiter or by all of them he is honest when he puts the query. Benefics
		aspecting the enemy of lord of 7 when he aspects the latter, then also, he is honest.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Only when the consultant is serious and sincere, then only truth will come out; prediction will
		prove to be correct.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">After satisfying himself, the astrologer has to note down the various questions, 1, 2, 3, and so
		on, if the person wants to consult more than one question. While judging the first question, take lagna as the
		first Bhava, for the second question find where Moon is deposited. Consider that sign as Lagna; for the third
		question, note the sign tenanted by Sun and take that sign as Lagna. For the fourth, the lagna should be the
		sign occupied by Jupiter; the fifth question is to be answered by taking either of the signs occupied by the
		stronger of the two planets Mercury or Venus and so on. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 5, 6 and 7: In these three slokas the author says that the astrologer must observe the
		omen (I add Nimitham then also) at the time of query and decide whether he can give favourable answer or not. It
		is advisable to read Brihat Samhita where Varahamihira has claborately dealt with "omens.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Next, he explains how one is to judge the various houses —— bhavas —— whether they are
		auspicious and strong to offer desirable results fulfilling one's desire or otherwise.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 8: If the benefics, Mercury, Jupiter or Venus or the lord of the house is situated in the
		particular house to be judged, or if they aspect the house, the matters signified by the house will offer
		beneficial results. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 9: A Bhava —— house —— becomes favourable if benefics occupy the 2nd, 4th. 7th. 10th and
		12th houses.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 10: If the lagna falls in a quadruped or a biped sign and if an evil planet aspects the
		Lagna, then the matters signified by Lagna Bhava fall through. One can expect only favourable results. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 11: One can predict beneficial results if evils do not occupy 1.4, 7, 8, 10 and 12 houses
		and in 1, 4, 7, 10 houses either lord of Lagna or its friend were to be deposited.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 12: Benefics Mercury, Jupiter and Venus in the kona signs 5 or 9 and the evils Sun, Mars
		and Saturn in 3 or 6 or 11 contribute for the beneficial results. They are advantageous. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 13: There will be either disease or dispute if evil planets are in lagna; disagreement,
		unhappiness and disharmony among relatives are to be predicted, if the malefics are found in the 4th house.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 14: There will be hindrance and difficulty for one to make a journey, if the 7th house is
		afflicted by the occupation of a malefic in the 7th house; one cannot have success in his enterprises if evils
		are in the 10th house; but if they are conjoined with or aspected by any of the benefics, then the malefics do
		their job by throwing obstacles and threatening failure but the benefics ultimately fulfil the querist's desire.
	</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 15: If the fixed sign Taurus, Leo, Scorpio or Aquarius be the ascendant, one cannot be
		defeated; there will be no loss; disease will continue and cannot be cured; journey will not be made; but one
		can have the rank or position which she expect. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 16: If any of the movable signs Aries, Cancer, Libra or Capricorn be the ascendant, one
		will be defeated, things will be lost, disease will disappear, journey will be made but one cannot have the rank
		or position or improvement in status. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">If any of the common signs were to rise (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius or Pisces) divide the sign
		into two halves; the first half and the second half. One is to consider the first half as though it is a fixed
		sign and offer such predictions as is given for a fixed sign: the second half is to be considered as a movable
		sign and predictions given for a movable sign is to be applied for the second half of the dual or common or
		Ubaya sign. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 17: One can have his desires fulfilled if any of the benefics is deposited in Lagna or if
		the Lagna falls in the Varga of benefics. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 18: Success in one's enterprise and the return of those who had been away are to be
		expected if benefics are situated in 1, 4, 5, 7, 9 or 10th houses and malefics are in 3 or 6 or 11. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 19: People who had gone away will return if Jupiter or Venus is deposited in the second or
		the third house. But if these benefics are tenanted in the fourth house, immediate return of the member is to be
		expected. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 20: The person who had gone out will return home shortly and the person is alive if
		Mercury and Venus are in 2 and 12 to Lagna or Moon. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 21: Enemy will come with his forces if the Lagna, Navamsa Lagna are in movable signs and
		Moon is in a fixed sign. If Moon is in a moveable sign and the Lagna and Navamsa Lagna are fixed signs, the
		enemy will not come (will there be litigation or opposition or competition can be found. similarly)</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 22: If Mercury, Jupiter or Venus is in 6, Moon, in a common sign, and the lagna in a fixed
		one, the enemy faces difficulties and feels sorry even though he may have sufficient strength (Even eye witness
		will fail in the litigation). </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 23: The enemy might have proceeded a little: Yet he will retrace, if evil planets are in
		the 5th and the 6th houses (withdrawal of the notice against the native —— no further proceedings). The enemy
		would have come to the boundary, yet he will go back, if evil planets are found in the 4th Bhava (suit-in the
		court of law will be withdrawn). </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 24: The enemy will be defeated if the watery signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces as well as
		Aquarius happen to be the 4th house and receive favourable aspects from benefics (win the case). If the 4th
		house is either Aries or Taurus and evil planets are deposited there, the enemy will come forward. He will be
		marching on (case will proceed). </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 25: Houses 9, 10, 11, 12, 1 and 2 indicate the offence: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 houses denote
		the defence. Benefics in between 9th and second house promise victory whereas if the benefics are between 3rd
		and 8th house, they threaten defeat (win or lose the case). </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 26: Compromise or agreement or treaty is to be predicted if the benefics are in Virgo or
		Libra or first half of Sagittarius or Aquarius. There cannot be any treaty if malefics occupy these signs. It is
		said that these signs must be either lagna or the 12th or the 11th house. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 27: Even a strong person cannot keep good health if the lagna receives aspect from evil
		planets, Moon is in 3 or 6 or 10 or 11 and the beneficial planets occupy 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10th houses.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 28: The consultant will have the recovery from the disease if Jupiter aspects the lagna
		occupied by strong Moon or if Venus or Jupiter is deposited in 1 or 4 or 7 or 10.</p>

		crossing the river: Saturn, to walk up the hill. Many planets in the Lagna indicate that one would have dreamt
		all those indicated by those planets. If those planets happen to be weak by occupying Neecha sign or enemy's
		camp, then the dream indicates some adverse or undesirable results. If Lagna is occupied by Sun and aspected by
		Moon or both Sun and Moon in 7, aspecting lagna, show that the querist has actually dreamt. Note the number of

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka (54 to 59). If the query ascendant or navamsa Lagna happens to be Taurus, Leo, Scorpio or

		ascendant is a chara rasi-movable sign, the theft is committed by a stranger. If the Lagna falls in the first
		drekkana, the property that is considered to be lost by theft will be at the gate of the house. If the Lagna is
		in the middle drekkana, that which is said to be lost is inside the house if it is the third drekkana, the

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Note the planets in the Kendhra. The direction is determined from the planet occupying the

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka (60 to 69). Note the time of query. Calculate the ascendant rising for that moment in that
		locality. Erect a stick in the open ground and let it stand for 12 inches. Measure the length of the shadow in
		inches. Same unit is to be taken. Convert the number of degrees and minutes in the sign in which the lagna has
		fallen. Ignore the number of signs passed. Multiply these minutes with the number of inches of the shadow.
		Divide by 7. Take the remainder alone. (There is nothing as Zero. If the product is completely divisible by 7,
		take the remainder as 7.) </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Then Gunakara for Sun is 5; Moon 21; Mars 14: Mercury 9: Jupiter 8; Venus 3; and Saturn 11. If
		one is the remainder take Moon and so on. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Now, take the product, multiply by the Gunakara of the planet obtained (by the remainder), again
		divide by 7 (this product). If the balance indicates the natural benefics the querist will be successful in his
		enterprise. If the remainder denotes a malefic, only adverse results are to be predicted. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Then to note the timing of event, follow the rule given below. Take the product obtained by
		multiplying the number of minutes of the lagna the length of the Shadow and Gunakara. Then take the sum total of
		the Gunakaras which is 71. Divide that product by 71. Take the remainder. Take the Gunakara of the planet
		obtained previously; in the cyclic order go on deducting. The remainder indicates the planet. If the remainder
		so obtained denote Sun, in so many days, the matter will materialise favourably; so also predict for Mars. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">If the remainder indicates Moon, so many Pakshas- fort- nights have to pass for fruitful
		results; so also for Venus. Mercury shows that the matter is successful in double the number of months. If it is
		Jupiter in so many months, if it is Saturn, so many years. This is applicable for pregnancy, income, journey
		outward and return, success, failure, etc. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">In the night hours, there can be no shadow. So carefully note the first syllable of the word
		spoken by the querist, if it is 'A', the lord is Sun if it is Ya Sa', lord in Moon. Ka is signified by Mars, Ta'
		is ruled by Mercury Tha by Jupiter, Cha' by Venus, Pa by Saturn. Each syllable has 4 classes. The lagna will be
		owned by the planet which governs the first syllable. If the syllable belongs to planets other than Sun and
		Moon, the second and 4th of the class of the syllable indicates the feminine sign owned by the planet. But if
		the syllable belongs to the other class, the lagna will be in the masculine sign of the planet. In the case of
		Sun and Moon all the four classes indicate their only sign. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Thus taking the lagna, one had to proceed. If one puts. many queries, take the first syllable

	<p class="block_16">Sloka 1: In the previous six chapters how to predict the results for a person taking his birth
		horoscope is explained. If no horoscope is available the results can be predicted by taking the time of query.
		The results obtained by scrutinising the birth chart or the Horary chart erected for the time of query will be
		the same. They will not differ. If at the time of query it is cloudy and it is not possible to ascertain the
		exact time which would have passed from sunrise then by putting further questions to the querist, his horoscope
		can be erected. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(What the Consultant and Astrologer should do.) </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 2: The consultant is advised to take fruits and fees to the astrologer. If the querist is
		asked to give any number between one and 108, he should give any one number. Then the astrologer takes the
		number for further calculation and prediction whether the result is favourable or not. The astrologer explains
		the past and future after he prays to his diety. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(How to erect the horoscope of a person who has lost it) </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 3: Divide by 9 the number given by the consultant. Note down the quotient and the
		remainder. The former denotes how many rasis (signs) from Aries (Mesha) has to be counted and the latter
		indicates the exact Navamsa to be taken in the next sign. Work out the position of the planet and note down the
		Bhavas for this horoscope; one has to predict the results whether advantageous or not. One should consider the
		strength of the planets and also to which matters each planet is the Chief Governor. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 4: Calculate the number of flowers and the units of money given to the astrologer by the
		consultant. He is to multiply this figure by the number given by the consultant, and then divide by 12. Note
		down the remainder. Jupiter will be deposited in the horoscope of the consultant in that sign which is obtained
		by counting from Aries with the remainder. Jupiter at the time of consultation will be in a sign. The astrologer
		has to look at the consultant and Guess his age and calculate how many times Jupiter would have completed the
		cycle of the zodiac. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Note how far Jupiter has passed in the sign, from the commencement of that sign at the
		consultation. So much will be the number of months and days which would have passed from the previous birthday
		of the consultant. Thus by noting the number of cycles made by the Jupiter and also the proportionate movement
		of Jupiter in the sign at the time of consultation you calculate the time passed after his birth. Or the sum is
		to be deducted from the time of the query. The result is to be taken as the exact time of the birth of the
		consultant. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 5: All the above calculations ars in Solar System, i.e., the month, the day, the nazhikhai
		(ghatis!). (I Ghati = 24 minutes = 1 Nazhikhai). Having obtained the birth time one can calculate and erect the
		complete horoscope, of the consultant who would have lost his. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 6: The consultant has given a number; multiply it by 2 and then divide the product by
		three. The question will be about a living object if the remainder is one. If the remainder is two, it will be
		about some mineral; if the remainder is three or zero, then the question would be about a plant. If at the time
		of question the sign Aries is the Lagna it represents two- legged bipeds. If the lagna falls in Rishaba it
		represents four- legged quadrupeds. If the Ascendant be Gemini it denotes pregnancy. Legal dispute will be the
		matter if Cancer rises, Question will be about the Government if Leo is the lagna. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 7: If the Ascendant falls in Virgo, the question will be about the secret activities with
		a lady other than his own wife. If Libra is the ascendant the question relates to one's business. It will be
		about one's fear from enemies, if the ascendant is Scorpio. Sagittarius, as ascendant indicates the loss of
		money. Capricorn denotes any undesirable action of the consultant. Aquarius being the ascendant indicates one's
		rank position, prestige, house or dwelling. Sages say that one should note whether the Rasi or Navamsa is
		strong. Select the stronger of the two. They follow the above rules to declare the result. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 8: (In this sloka the author gives the various matters indicated by each planet.) </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(a) If Sun is deposited either in Rasi or Navamsa in his own sign, at the time of the

	<p class="block_16">(c) Mars in his own Rasi or Navamsa denotes fire, danger, accident or dispute. </p>
	<p class="block_16">(d) Mercury similarly placed indicates business or cultivation.</p>
	<p class="block_16">(e) Jupiter shows that the question would be about the consultant's benefactors or high

	<p class="block_16">(f) Venus indicates about one's smooth run of life.</p>
	<p class="block_16">(g) Saturn portrays that the queries relate to a person or a property. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 9: (Strength of the planets and the extent of the result). Exalted planets give double the
		effect; planets in debilitation produce no effect at all; planets in their friend's quarters give only 50% of
		the result. If a planet is in a neutral house the effect is very moderate. Suppose there are two planets in
		exaltation or they are in their own signs, then select the stronger of the two and note to which matter the
		stronger planet is the chief governor; also consider the house occupied by it. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 10: (Time of event). The matter will be fulfilled immediately if the significator be
		exalted. If it is in his own sign, in a few days, it will be realised. If it is in friend's quarters, it takes a
		few months. If it is neither exalted nor in its own or friendly sign one can realise only after some years; if a
		planet be in conjunction with or aspected by an evil planet, then the consultant will be disappointed: there
		will be only failure. If the lord of the ascendant is deposited in the house which is to be judged for that
		query or if the lord of the ascendant is aspected by strong benefics the native will have success, at once. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 11: (Direction allotted to each sign): The zodiac is a circle of 360 degrees, and there
		are 12 signs of 30 degrees each also. The zodiac is divided into 108 Navamsas, these are all fixed. Kalidas
		explains how each sign indicates a particular direction. This does not agree with other authors</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 12 (Aruda Lagna): Suppose a person with flowers and fruits approaches an astrologer and is
		in a place to put a query, then one has to take the sign indicated by the direction in which he is standing.
		That sign is called Aruda Lagna at the time of query. An Astrologer should consider the owner of the Aruda Lagna
		and that particular house which indicates the nature of the query. He should include, while judging the planets
		conjoined or aspected by them. The astrologer has to predict such questions whether it may be t desirable or
		not, </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Slokas 13, 14 and 15: Note down the gatikas which have passed from the time of sunrise to the
		time of consultation. Multiply the number of gatikas by nine. Then divide by 20. The quotient indicates the
		position of Moon at that time. This Moon is called Sukshma Moon. But the position of Moon for the moment of
		consultation according to ephemeris is called Sthula Moon. The Navamsas of both the Sthula and Sukshma Moon is
		to be found out. If the Sthula Moon receives aspect from the Sukshma Moon, Jupiter and Mercury, then the
		consultant wants to know about an animal. But if Mars, Rahu and Saturn aspect the Sthula Moon, the question
		would be about a mineral. If Sun and Venus aspects the matter will refer to vegetable kingdom. Jupiter, Venus
		and Rahu aspecting the Sthula Moon indicates many matters; if the Sthula Moon occupies Gemini, Virgo or Libra
		Navamsa, the question is about two-legged bipeds. If the Sthula Moon is in a watery sign which indicates
		multi-legged creatures. If the Sthula Moon occupies Sagittarius and Aquarius Navamsa, the question is about some
		of God without legs. If the Sthula Moon is in Aries, Taurus or Capricorn the matter indicated is about four
		legged (quadrupeds) one is to know in which portion of a rasi a planet is situated. Sign is to be divided into
		three equal parts and the first part is called youth, the second Yauvana and the third Vridha. These are the
		three conditions of a planet situated in a sign. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 16: Signs from Aries are movable, fixed and common. The movable signs Aries, Cancer, Libra
		and Capricorn are called Garba. The fixed ones are called devara and the common ones are called Bahya. Garba and
		Devara indicate an object held in the right hand whereas Bahya shows that in left hand. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 17: Thus one should guess a thing kept close in the hand whether it is short or long, is
		to be judged from the length of the rasi. (Signs are classified as short ascension and long ascension). The
		shape, the colour of the material is to be judged for the Navamsa sign. The nature of the cloud reveals whether
		the object is beneficial or not. The place is to be judged from the sign whether it is on land or sky or water
		or mountains. Also the sign indicates whether it is wicked or uncontrolled for tamed or polite. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 18 (Time of accomplishment): The consultant gives a number within 108; divide by 5. The
		quotient is to be added to the number given. Divide the same by 60. In so many Ghatikas the matter will be
		fulfilled. Divide by 30 you get so many thithis. Divide the sum by 7 it indicates so many days after
		consultation. Divide by 12 this shows the number of months; divide by 60 the remainder indicates the number of
		years. This method is to be followed for all questions. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 19: If the lord of the house which is to be judged for a particular question and the lord

		Lagna were to be Seershalaya. But if the lagna is occupied by a malefic or if the navamsa lagna is a Prishtodaya
		one cannot be successful in his attempt. If the lagna or navamsa lagna is connected with benefics and also

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 4: An attempt will be successful if (a) a benefic occupies the lagna, (b) the navamsa

	<p class="block_16">Sloka 6: If a planet is in its own navamsa and aspects its own in any of the Trikona houses, it

		by a benefic. Failure is to be expected if malefic occupies such an ascendant. If the ascendant is a fixed one,
		and evil planets occupy the ascendant, the result will be very advantageous. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 6: If the ascendant is in a movable sign and the Moon is in a fixed one, the arrival of
		the opponent is doubtful. But if Ascendant is in a fixed sign and Moon is in a movable one, the opponent will
		arrive. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 7: If the ascendant be in a fixed sign and the Moon is in a common one, the opponent will
		come a long way but retrace his own step.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 8: If the Moon be in a movable sign and the Ascendant be in a common one, the opponent
		comes half the way and returns home. If the Ascendant is in a movable sign and the Moon is deposited in a common
		one and both are aspected by malefics, there will be the fight (or war or litigation) and there will be loss for
		both. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 9: If the Ascendant is in a movable sign, and if either Sun or Saturn or Mercury or Venus
		be in the Ascendant, the opponent will march on speedily. But if Saturn, Mercury or Venus be retrograde the
		enemy will not leave his permanent place. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 10: If the Ascendant at the time of question be in a fixed sign and receives aspects from
		Jupiter and Saturn the opponent will not leave his place': but he will arrive, if the ascendant is in a fixed
		sign and is aspected by Jupiter and Saturn; and if evils are in three, five and six there will be the fight.
		Evil planets in the fourth house indicate that the opponent will retreat. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 11: If Sun and Moon are in the fourth house, the opponent will not come. But if Mercury,
		Jupiter and Venus are in the fourth house, the opponent will come quickly. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 12: If Aries, Taurus, Leo or Sagittarius happens to be the fourth house counted from the
		Ascendant, the enemy will return to his home whether these signs are occupied by planets or not. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 13: If Jupiter or Saturn were to be in the Ascendant, in a fixed sign the enemy would have
		left his place; he would have halted on his way; if movable sign is the Ascendant, and Sun or Jupiter were to be
		in the Ascendant, the enemy will surely arrive. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 14: Find the strongest planet and note in which house, it is deposited. One can expect the
		return of a person in so many months as is shown by the mumber of the house occupied by the strongest planet.
	</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 15: If the strongest planet is situated in the Navamsa, in a movable sign, the above
		calculation is to be made. But if the navamsa sign is an immovable one, the duration is to be doubled. If the
		Navamsa sign is a common one, the period will be trebled. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 16: The return of a person is to be expected when the lord of the 7th house begins to
		retrograde (if Capricorn or Aquarius happens to be the ascendant this rule is not applicable at all). </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 17: If there is no planet between the lagna and the sign occupied by Moon, the opponent
		will arrive within so many days as is indicated by the number of the sign occupied by Moon counted from the
		Ascendant. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">CHAPTER III Success or Failure </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 1: Even when a ruler of a place is opposed or attached by another, if either in the lagna
		or in the 7th or in the 10th house, benefits are deposited, one will win and come out successful. Jupiter, Venus
		and Mercury in the 9th house also brings victory. But Mars and Saturn in the 9th house threatens failure.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 2: The houses 3 to 8 counted from the Ascendant indicates the people in the place who are
		attacked if benefics are deposited in these houses; victory is certain for the people. The houses 9, 10, 11, 12
		and 1, 2 if occupied by beneficial planets, there will be success. But, if in the 10th, 11th and 12th houses
		evil planets are deposited then the people in the place will lose whereas those who attacked will win.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Slokas 3 &amp; 4: A compromise will be arrived at or a treaty will be the result if benefics
		occupy 1 or 11 or 12 and these houses happen to be two-legged-biped. If evil planets occupy common signs there
		will be war to the end. In 1 or 4 or 7 or 10 if benefics are deposited and aspected by benefics they will come
		to a compromise and the war will end in a treaty. But if the Kenthra houses are occupied by the malefics and
		also aspected by malefics war will go on to the last.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 5: If in the second or third house, Jupiter or Venus or both are deposited, the enemy will
		go back very soon. Under the same circumstances, anyone who would have gone abroad, will return back soon
		without any doubt.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">CHAPTER IV</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 1: If evil planets do not occupy 1, 4, 7, 8 or 10 the benefics are in 1, 4, 5, 7, 9 or 10
		one will realise first ambition. If not, the result will be just opposite.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 2: There is success or progress if in the 3rd or 5th or 6th or 11th or 12th benefics are
		deposited. If the ascendant falls in Gemini, Virgo, or Aquarius and at the same time beneficial planets are also
		deposited therein, one is to expect desirable results.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 3: Improvement in status and achievement of one's aims are promised by beneficial planets,
		occupying the houses 7 and 10. If they are in the 1st or 2nd or 5th one can expect prestige, power and money.
		Evil planets occupying the 11th or the 12th cannot reduce any advantageous results. Moon in the ascendant does
		no good. But if it is 10th house, it is beneficial.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 4: If Jupiter aspects Moon deposited in 2 or 3 or 6 or 7 or 10 or 11 one can be happy,
		make gains, etc. through other sex. But evil planets in 1 or 3 or 5 or 8 or 9 bring loss, cause fear and also
		failure in one's attempts or business. But benefics in these houses are advantageous.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 5: Beneficial planets in I or 5 or 7 or 8 receiving aspect from other benefics and moon in
		Upachayasthana promises recovery from disease if the person is ill.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>

	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 1: If all planets occupy 2, 3 and 5 the person will return home early. If benefics occupy
		these houses the person whom it would have been thought to be lost, will return and also the missing article
		will be recovered. If Jupiter and Venus occupy the above 2, 3 or 5 the person will return shortly.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 2: The person will return home early if Jupiter is in a Kendra sign and if planet occupies
		the 6th or the 7th house. If Venus and Mercury were to be in 5 or 9 the person will return quickly.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 3: Moon in the 8th house and Kendra sign unoccupied by evil planets show that the person
		will return safely. Also he will return with gains if in the Kendra signs benefics are found.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 4: If the ascendant is a Prishtodaya sign and evil planets aspect it, the person is
		undergoing lot of trouble anp may be imprisoned. If evil planets are in the third house and they are not
		aspected by beneficial ones, that person would have started from his place to a foreign land. If in the sixth
		house, evil planets are deposited the person will be either dead or missing. He would have been kidnapped by
		robbers if the malefics are in the Kendra signs (1, 4, 7 or 10).</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 5: Note the planet which is in direct motion next to the lagna; calculate how many rasis
		away from lagna it is. Multiply it by 12. In so many days he will return; if the planet next to lagna is
		retrograde, then he will return in as many days as the number of signs in between the ascendant and the sign
		occupied by the retrograde planet.<br class="calibre6" /> </p>
	<p class="block_16">CHAPTER VI</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">To Regain The Lost</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 1: A person related to the consultant alone, would have taken the missing article and it
		is there only, if the lagna falls in a fixed sign or the Navamsa lagna is in a fixed sign or if the lagna is
		Vargothama</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 2: The article which is considered to be lost, will be near the gate of the house, if the
		first 10° of a sign will be the lagna. But if the lagna is between 10 and 20, the missed article will be in the
		middle portion of the house; if the lagna falls between 20 and 30, it will be in the backyard of the house.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 3: Strong Moon in lagna or the lagna is seershodhaya, occupied or aspected by beneficial
		planets, indicates that one will recover the property, considered to be lost. If the 11th house is occupied by a
		strong benefic, the property will be recovered.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 4: Planets situated in the houses 1, 4, 7 or 10 indicate where the property that had been
		missed, would be.. It indicates the direction by which it is taken. If there is no planet in the Kendra house,
		then the lagna indicates the direction. The distance by which the missing article is taken is to be ascertained
		by considering the Navamsa lagna. The nature of the property lost is judged through the navamsa lagna:</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">(a) the rising decanate describes the robbers.</p>
	<p class="block_16">(b) the ascendant indicates the time, when it was lost and also the direction by which and the
		place to which the missing article is taken. The age, caste, and other particulars of the robber is judged from
		the lord of the ascendant.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">CHAPTER VII</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 1: Predict that a male child will be born if Saturn is deposited in the houses 3, 5, 7, 9
		or 11. If not, a girl will be born. As regards marriage, if Saturn is in even houses, one will be successful,
		otherwise, no.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 2: If Moon is in 3 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 11 receiving aspect from Jupiter and Mercury,
		marriage will take place. If benefics occupy Trikona or Kendra houses, then also marriage will come up.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 3: If Venus is 7 to Moon and Saturn is in 7 to Sun or if Venus and Saturn are in 4th and
		8th houses, there will be the rain during the rainy season.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 4: If benefics are found in the houses 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 or 10 and such a house is a watery
		one, there will be rain. If Moon is in the ascendant in a watery sign predict that there will be the rain.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 5: A male child will be born if the lagna be in a masculine sign and also aspected by male
		planets. If the ascendant be a female sign, receiving aspect from feminine planets, the child will be female. If
		Mercury is situated in the ascendant, the lady will be pregnant.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 6: One would like to know about a girl if Moon or Mercury either occupies or aspects the
		lagna. If Saturn. occupies or aspects the lagna, the query will be about an old woman. If Jupiter or Sun is
		situated in the ascendant or if they aspect the ascendant, the lady in question would have recently delivered.
		The lady will be maintaining strong health if Mars or Venus occupies or aspects the ascendant. The above
		principle is also applicable for males.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 7: Strong planet in the lagna indicates that the consultant would like to know about one
		with whom he is closely connected. If the strong planet is in the third house, the matter will be about one's
		youngster. If it occupies the 5th.it relates to one's offspring. If the strong planet is in 4, the matter
		relates to the mother or sister. If it is in 6 the query is about the enemy.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 8: If it is in 7, about one's wife, if in 9, it will be about a virtuous person doing
		meritorious deed. If it is in 10 it relates to one's Guru. If the Lord of the Navamsa lagna is strong in the
		Horary lagna one will put questions about himself. If the Lord of the Navamsa lagna is strong and is a friend to
		the Lord of the Horary Lagna, the question will be about one's friend. If they are enemical, the question will
		be about one's enemy.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 9: If the lagna falls in a movable sign and also the navamsa lagna, the question will be
		about one who has left his place and gone overseas. If a planet has moved away from the 7th house and it is not
		retrograde, he, who has gone out, will return. But if the planet is retrograde he will not return.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 10: One will enjoy another man's wife if Sun. Venus or Mars is situated in the 7th house.
		One will enjoy his own wife if the 7th house is occupied by Jupiter. One enjoys a prostitute if Moon or Mercury
		is in 9. One enjoys a woman of a very low caste if Saturn is in 7. From the nature of the Moon, ascertain the
		age of the woman. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 11: He who has gone out will fall ill in a foreign land if in the 9th house Saturn and
		some other evil planet are deposited. He who has gone out will not return, but will die there itself, if Saturn
		is in 8. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Sloka 12: One's father who had already left his place will further move on to another country if
		Sun or a benefic or both are in the 8th house, receiving aspect from another benefic. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>

	<h3 id="id_Toc184334374" class="block_12">SINENDRAMALA</h3>
	<p class="block_16">One should approach an astrologer with such a devotion and affection similar to a devotee of God

	<p class="block_16">By Shri PADMAPRAPUSURI</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">He prays to Lord Ganesh and describes the fundamentals like the names of 12 signs; planets; the
		exaltation, debilitation; etc. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">According to him, morning is indicated by Jupiter and Mercury. Evening is indicated by Moon and
		Venus. The day, by Sun and Mars whereas Rahu and Saturn denote the time of sunset. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Jupiter and Venus denote two-legged ones; Sun and Mars represent four-legged one: Saturn and
		Mercury denote birds: Moon and Rahu, the reptiles. Moon indicates large ones Venus flat one; Sun and Mars
		square: Mercury and Jupiter round; Rahu and Saturn tall. (Hindu authors give different versions.) </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Mars indicates red colour; Mercury green; Jupiter golden; Moon handsome: Sun brilliant red:
		Venus white: Saturn and Rahu, black.</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Mercury indicates child; Mars young man; Moon and Venus adults; Sun, Jupiter, Saturn and Rahu
		indicates aged people. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">Then, he describes what the twelve houses indicate. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">He also gives the method, by which one has to measure out the shadow and calculate the time of
		query. This is not at all applicable to different latitudes, since in many latitudes, shadow is so long, that it
		cannot be measured at all. And this method may be tried by people living close to the Equator. Application of
		this rule is limited. Only day time is to be preferred —— Cloudy days are out of question. When time-piece is
		available, there is no use for this method. Then, he gives the method by which one is to find out whether the
		lagna is strong, and also the bhava to be judged, is strong. It is general, and it can never come and it will
		mostly fail. Then, he deals with eclipse planet. He claims that when lord of lagna aspects the lagna which is to
		be judged, then the promotion of the bhava of the success is to be predicted. This is also not correct. He gives
		his opinion that if lord of lagna or lord of 11 is situated in the 11th house, one will gain. Stellar Astrology
		disproves this rule. Again, his opinion about the houses 6, 8 and 12 is not correct. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">In Stanza 87, he discusses whether one will have safe deli- very or not. He says that if lord of
		5 is deposited or is aspecting the 5th, then the delivery is not easy: if an evil planet is in 5, or aspects 5,
		one is to predict miscarriage. But, in practice, it was found that lord 5 in 5, deposited in the constellation
		of lord of 8 in 8, has caused cessarian operation. Constellation theory alone, will prove to be successful. He
		says that twin birth is to be predicted, if 8 planets are deposited in 4 houses, 2 in each. Such a combination
		will be very rare. (So, research cannot be successfully done in one's lifetime.) He says that the age of the
		intra-uterine life of the Foetus is, as many number of months as the number of houses, where Venus is situated
		from the lagna. Thus, he goes on dealing in his book. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">My opinion is that the whole thing is general and is not at all helpful to exactly pin-point the
		nature of the event and the time of the event. </p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_16">As regards disease, he says Vayu: Pitha; sleshma like that. All out of date-Anyhow, I have to
		say that it is not useful for modern times. </p>
