	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To find out the significators a number 109, within 249, given and the horary chart cast from this
		number with the twelve cusps for Bombay and the planetary position at the moment of judgment is as given above.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The significator of houses 2, 6 and 10 are Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and
		Kethu. All these planets are to give results of the houses 2, 6 and 10. But those planets which are to give you
		job at the earliest opportunity are to be decided with the help of the ruling planets at the moment of judgment.
		The day is Tuesday ruled by Mars. The sign transited by Moon is Thulam owned by Venus. The constellation
		transited by Moon is that of Mars. The lagna is Dhanus owned by Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu represent Jupiter as
		Rahu occupies Jupiter sign Meena and Kethu is conjoined with Jupiter.. Therefore the ruling planets are Mars,
		Venus, Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu. None of these ruling planets are posited either in the constellation or sub of a
		retrograde planet. So take them. (If any of ruling planets is posited either in the constellation or sub of a
		retrograde planet, reject it.)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now take the common planets between the significators of houses 2, 6 and 10 and the ruling
		planets. They are Mars, Venus, Rahu and Kethu. They will give you job in their conjoined period.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">According to dasa-bhukti, Mars Dasa balance is 0 years, 3 months and 23 days from 22-7-1969, The
		bhukti running is that of Moon. Moon is not a ruling planet. Therefore Moon bhukti will not give. It ends on
		15-11-69. Then starts Rahu dasa. Rahu is a ruling planet and also a strong significator. So you will get job in
		Rahu Dasa and Rahu Bhukti. In this the following are the antra periods which may give you job.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(a) Rahu Dasa Rahu Bhukti Rahu Antra from 15-11-1969 to 11-4-1970.</p>

	<p class="block_4">(c) Rahu Dasa Rahu Bhukti Venus Antra from 9-8-1971 to 21-1-1972.</p>
	<p class="block_4">(d) Rahu Dasa Rahu Bhukti Mars Antra from 30-5-1972 to 27-7-1972.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The planets in 11th bhava and its owner indicate whether one's desire will be fulfilled early or
		not. Sun and Mercury are in 11th bhava and Moon owns it. All these are fast moving planets. So your desire will
		be fulfilled at the earliest opportunity. The earliest period, in the above four periods, is 15-11-1969 to
		11-4-1970. You will therefore get a job during this period if transit also agrees. Sun transits the Kethu sub
		and in Sathabisha star owned by Rahu on 1-3-1970.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore transit also agrees and you will get a job on 1-3-1970.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 10th cusp shows the nature of the job. It is 5° 9' in Mithuna, i.c., Mercury sign Mars star
		and Sun sub. So the nature of your job will be indicated by Mercury, Mars and Sun. All these three planets are
		posited in watery signs thereby indicating that you will have grasp, fiuent flow of thoughts, intelligence and
		quick understanding. Sun indicates Government, Mars and Mercury indicate Mechanical Engineering. So the nature
		of job will be that of a Mechanical Engineer in Government. (The querist confessed that he i actually a graduate
		in Mechanical Engineering and is in search of a job).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As Mars indicates machinery, Mercury, indicates paper and communication and Sun indicates
		Government, other interpretation about the nature of job could be a Government service in Printing Press. A
		third interpretation could be a surgeon as Sun indicates medicine, Mars shows surgery and Mercury shows correct
		diagnosis and quick decisions.</p>

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Then, note the significators of 10th house. Saturn in direct motion and Sun who is ever direct
		occupy the 10th house. They are the occupants. Planets deposited in the constellation of the occupants are much
		stronger than the lords of the constellation. Neptune and Rahu are in Saturn's star: (Pushya, Anuradha and
		Uthrapadra are Saturn's stars). Sun is in its own star and sub. Jupiter is in Sun's star Uthrapalguni along with
		Kethu (and Uranus).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Hence the significators are Rahu, Jupiter, Kethu, Sun and Saturn.</p>

		touches that point and it is retrograde.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Of the significators, the strongest is Sun and Kethu. Sun is lord of 2 in 10 in exaltation and in

	<p class="block_4">"When can I be a famous person?"</p>
	<p class="block_4">"Good. Give me a number within 249,"</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"One. I want to become number one. So, I give this number. Also tell me please, what I should
		do," asks a boy aged 15 in whose horoscope, he says that many planets are exalted.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"You should study law, if you want to be a lawyer: Chemistry, if you desire to be a chemist
		medicine, if you have to become a doctor; but for politics, as Max O'Rell says "you need only to study your own
		interest. Also you should know what Wendell Philips had said, "Two kinds of men generally best succeed in
		political life; men of no principle, but of great talent; and men of no talent, but of one principle that of
		obedience to their superiors. Do you want to serve for the prosperity of your country or what?"</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"Charity begins at home, is what all say: But I want to do good so that my children and
		grandchildren will lead a pleasant and peaceful life. There should be discipline, security for life, security of
		property, etc. I do not want to be a minister but I want to serve and satisfy the mass."</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"Then say that you want to become a statesman." </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"What is the difference between a politician and a statesman?"</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"A politician acts in such a way always bearing in his or her mind the next election. But a
		statesman cares more for the welfare of the next generation. A politician will form a party and join such a
		party which come out successful whereas a stateman minds only the progress and prosperity of his country: so, a
		statesman will guide and direct his course of action, whereas a politician will yield, adjust to circumstances
		and be satisfied to drift."</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"Thanks, Sir: I want to be a statesman. Can I become a famous statesman."</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"So, just like a coachman follows his horses but he holds. on the reign and at appropriate time
		guides them, you should conduct yourself. You should remember what Coleridge has advised. The three great ends
		for a statesman are, security to possessors, facility to acquirers and liberty and hope to the people,"</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"You can become a famous statesman, by doing nothing yourself but causing everything to be done.
		Leave nothing to chance: be attentive night and day: see into failure: do not regard the present: then only you
		can change a nation from what it is to what it ought to be."</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"Yes! What does my number one indicate?"</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">First It shows that you need advice for success. So I did.. Now I shall predict."</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whenever Saturn is in lagna one should have patience and perseverance. Don't you know that people
		who want to do good, never get discouraged if they are defeated once, twice and so on. What is perseverance?
		Does it not clearly show that a few attempts fail and again an attempt is made.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Nothing is impossible. Can I go round the world. I have no conveyance, etc. Johnson said. He that
		shall work, with vigour, three hours a day, will pass in seven years, a space equal to the circumstances of the
		globe. So you be making attempts. When once you start this noble enterprise, do not leave it: go ahead.</p>

	<p class="block_4">One is to predict the future of an Institution, just like the future of a person. Moon is in 5.

		dealers. Mars Dasa 7 years will be the years of expansion, improvement etc. The results will be most
		encouraging. The reputation of the Institution will reach a new height. Circulation of publication and gains
		through books and periodicals will shoot up. Mars in the constellation of node in 6 promises grand success.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Rahu Dasa 18 years will prove to further improving as Rahu is in the constellation of Mercury in

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Jupiter Dasa 16 years shows much advantages. Saturn in Kethu star denotes renovation, expenses

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The peculiarity is this. I know that this Institution will expand slowly, steadily and surely. It

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">6th house matters are indicated by planets posited in the constellation of occupants; then the

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Jupiter star is not occupied by any planet and so Jupiter is very strong. Sun in 6 governs
		Karthik, Uthrapalguni and Uthrashada, Sun alone is in its star and Sun is a strong significator. Kethu governs
		Aswini, Makha and Moola, Saturn and Mars are in Kethu star. Venus is in 6 and Bharani, Poorvapalguni and
		Poorvashada are ruled by Venus. Moon and Jupiter are in Venus star. Mercury is also in 6. Ashlesha, Jyeshta and
		Revathi are ruled by Mercury and Rahu is posited there.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thus it can be seen that all planets promise that there are many to contribute and see that the
		Institute grows up and expands like anything.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Saturn is lord of 12. No planet is in Saturn star. Hence during the periods and sub periods of
		Saturn, there will be. expenses outweighing income. No doubt there will be receipt more than normal; but
		expenses will go still higher. Further Saturn brings about changes in the organisation during Saturn Dasa Kethu
		bhukti. Always the conjoined period of Saturn and Kethu must bring change in the organisation. So immediately
		during Saturn Bhukti Kethu Anthra in Venus Dasa (Septr., 1971) one chief organiser will pass away. Then during

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Moon indicates what you have in your mind, Le. the nature of query ete, Moon is in 10th in the
		constellation of Sun (owner of 6th) and sub of Venus (occupant of 2nd). Further Saturn (owner of 11th) aspects
		Moon by its 10th aspect. Jupiter (owner of 10th) aspects Moon by its 5th aspect. Therefore the query is
		regarding the houses 2, 6, 10 and 11. These houses put together indicate promotion. Therefore the query is
		regarding promotion. But these houses 2, 6, 10 and 11 will be present in everybody's chart and we can find out
		the significators in all these cases. Does it mean that all these persons are promised promotion? No! Some may
		be promoted, others may not be.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So, what one must necessarily see first is whether one is to get promotion at all. For this
		consider the 11th cusp and find out whether the lord of the sub of the 11th cusp is either retro- grade or
		deposited in a constellation whose lord is retrograde. If either is retrograde, one cannot get promotion. If the
		sub-lord and the lord of the constellation in which it is situated are in direct motion and if the same sub-lord
		is also a significator of houses2 or 6 or 10 or 11, then promotion is promised. Otherwise not. Fulfilment of all
		these three conditions is a must. If any one of them is not fulfilled, promotion is not guaranteed.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In your case the 11th cusp is 15° 17' Makar, ie. in Saturn Isign Moon star and Jupiter sub.
		Jupiter is not retrograde. It is deposited in the constellation of Sun who is never retrograde. Sun is owner of
		6th house and therefore Jupiter is also a significator of 6th house. Therefore all the three conditions are
		fulfilled and you are promised promotion. The further procedure is to find out the ruling planets at the moment
		of judgment: take out common planets in the ruling planets and the significators; then work out the dasa-bhukti
		period of these common planets and finally pin-point the date by the help of transit.</p>

	<p class="block_4">From the above table, the significators of the houses 2, 6, 10 and 11 are Mars, Mercury, Venus,
		Saturn, Kethu, Sun, Moon, Jupiter and Rahu. All the nine planets are significators, Of these Mars is in
		retrograde motion. Those planets which are themselves retrograde in motion but posited in the constellation and
		sub of planets in direct motion, will give results after they become direct. They however can't give results as
		long as they are retrograde. But if a planet, even when it is direct, it deposited in the constellation or sub
		of a retrograde planet, it well appear to give results but will ultimately fall through. Mars will therefore be
		able to give results only after it becomes direct.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The significators are many in number. The best method to eliminate the unfavourable ones is to
		find out the ruling planets and then find out the common between them and the significators. This common planets
		will give the result during their conjoined period. The day is Tuesday owned by Mars. The sign transited by Moon
		is Makar. Saturn owns it. The star transited by Moon is Uttarashada owned by Sun and the Lagna is Scorpio owned
		by Mars. So the ruling planets are Mars, Saturn and Sun. They are also significators. So they will give you
		promotion during their conjoined period.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">As 11th house is owned by Saturn, there will be delay in fulfilment of your desire. Further the
		same Saturn is lord of 12th and is posited in horary lagna. This is undesirable. Horary lagna is spoiled. This
		indicates that there will be lot of obstacles and hindrances in the way of your promotion and Saturn will delay
		the promotion till such time that you will feel trustrated and start thinking that the promotion will not come
		at all. But the same Saturn is lord of 11th and also a ruling planet and therefore it has to give you promotion.
		It will play a double roll.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Anything in life which is promised by the planets will be experienced when dasa-bhukti of the
		common planets between significators and ruling planets operates. (Suppose child birth was promised to a person
		and even for 10 years after marriage no child was born. This is because the particular dasa-bhukti was not
		operating. Once it operates, he will have.)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Similarly in the above case, though promotion is promised, it will come only when dasa-bhukti of
		promotion promising planets operates.</p>

	<p class="block_4">Sun's dasa balance is only 11 days from 1-7-1969. After that Moon Dasa will run. But Moon is not
		a ruling planet. So during Moon Dasa you will not get promotion. (Actually, Saturn aspecting Moon by its 10th
		aspect will throw obstacles: during Moon Dasa). Then comes Mars Dasa. Mars is common in both significators and
		ruling planet. So it will give promotion during its dasa.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mars Dasa starts on 12-7-1979. It will run for seven years. In Mars Dasa Saturn Bhukti must come.
		In Saturn Bhukti Sun Antra must come and only then you will get promotion. Mars Dasa Saturn Bhukti Sun Antra
		runs between 2-7-1982 and 22-7-1982. Therefore you will be promoted in the month of July 1982. Till then Saturn
		will bring lot of obstacles, failures. frustration, etc.</p>

		the sub-lord. 11th cusp is in Capricorn at 13 degrees. So it is in the star of Moon and sub of Rahu. Rahu is in
		Kumbha in 12; it has to give the results of 11 as there is no planet in 11 and its lord is also the lord of the

		occupying the 6th house. Therefore Rahu is to give the results of 6, 11 and 12. What does this combination
		indicate? It shows that one getspromotion by being selected for that post even though there is competition (6th)
		and there is change in the nature of the work, (12th). As it has nothing to do with the third house, it will not

	<h2 id="id_Toc184334498" class="block_12">When will the Promotion come?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Now the period is Budh Dasa, Budh Bhukti, according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, a planet will give

		retrograde then the matter will fall through. It will appear as though it will happen but it will not fructify.
		Here the lord of the constellation in which Mercury is deposited is Sun Sun can never be retrograde in motion.
		Sun is represented by the node Kethu as Kethu is deposited in Leo owned by Sun. As Kethu is conjoined with
		Venus, it will give the 6th house results also as Venus is in 6 in its own constellation.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Therefore at the time Budha transits the 11th cusp the good news will be heard, and when Sun

		Bhukti, it will be Mercury Dasa Mercury Bhukti Mars Anthra Jupiter Shookshma. Mars is lord of 2 and significator
		of 2 as there is no planet in its star; Mars is in the constellation of Venus in 6 and sub of Sun, owner and

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Now, which houses are to be referred to find out whether one's grievance regarding his seniority
		will be redressed and he will be restored to his rightful place. First, note the sub-lord of the cusp of the
		11th house. The 11th cusp falls in Scorpio (Vrischika) 8-30, i.e., in Anuradha star governed by Saturn-Sani and
		in the sub owned by Venus (Sukra). As Venus is situated in the constellation of a planet in the 2nd Bhava (Rahu
		is in 2) and as Venus is the ruler of Ketlin the 10th house and occupies the 6th, surelyhe will have his
		seniority question settled in his favour. At the time when the significators of 10th and 11th houses operate,
		you must have it redressed to your satisfaction. The Meridian (the 10th house cusp) falls in Sukra's sign Thula
		(Libra), in Rahu's star Swathi, and in the sub of Mercury (Budha). No planet is situated in the 10th house
		Saturn alone is in star of Venus, lord of 10. 11th house is owned and occupied by Mars (Mangal), and Moon
		(Chandra) alone is in Mars Dasa. Therefore, at the time when Mars Dasa Rahu Bhukti Sukra Anthra Sani Shookshma
		runs on 21-11-1969, you will know that your seniority is restored and you have your legitimate upgrading,
		increase in income and improvement in status.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">For number 75' applying the same principles, it has to be predicted that his grievance will be
		redressed and he will gain only when he runs the dasa of Mars (Mangal), bhukti of Rahu, anthra of Sani and
		shookshama of Sani on 10-1-1970.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334500" class="block_12">Change in Job:</h2>
	<p class="block_4">"Sir, I am at present employed in Calcutta. Will there be any change in my present occupation,
		i.e., will there be any change from the present occupation to a new one. If so, will the change bring good to

	<p class="block_4">He continues:</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">"Since I do not have with me my date of birth and the time, I am giving below a number, my place

	<p class="block_4">Birth place: Koduvayur, Palghat District.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Star: Vishakam.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In querant's own words, he has no time and date of birth to give and wishes his query to be
		answered on the basis of Horary Astrology. Horary Astrology is helpful in prediction even when the birth
		horoscope is available because, while the birth chart is likely to be incorrect when worked out on the basis of
		incorrect birth times, the horary or prasna chart is never so. Further the positions of the planets in the
		heavens at the time an astrologer takes up the query for answer will bear a definite relation to the query--the
		urge to answer is created in the astrologer's mind only at such a time when there is an interrelation between
		the matter in question and the heavenly positions of the planets. Horary Astrology reveals the answer accurately
		and is quite scientific. Horary Astrology, in other words, is a cross-verification of the results computed on
		the basis of the natal horoscope, the dasa bhukti, etc., and will give the same answer as that obtained from a
		reading of birth horoscope-in fact, much more accurately clearly and to the point than the natal chart where one
		gets many alterations. Indeed, the horary system is much more useful than the natal chart to find out answers to
		specific questions. It should not be dismissed as one unworthy of use in the way a few do. While our ancient
		seers who gave us the various slokas were possessed of great intuition, they did not expect us to remain static
		and only remain content quoting from their scriptures. Just as the swan when given milk combined with water
		throws away the water and takes only the pure milk, we will not be indulging in any wrong if we discard those
		methods which have failed us in actual practice and take only those that have proved correct. Astrology has been
		lying low all this time because no one took pains to develop the science and develop it along scientific lines.
		No wonder that when a new, scientific method of analysis is presented, there is great aversion in those circles
		trading in the name of traditional astrology.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Krishnamurti Padhdhati, for instance, presents astrology in a new way stressing the effects based
		on constellations; the constellations, in turn, are divided among the nine planets in the same proportion as the
		years ruled by them in the Parasara's Dasa system of 120 years. Thus, when a native is born with Chandra at
		birth in Guru's constellation Punavarvasu he is said to run the dasa of Guru and not of Chandra, the effects
		will be what Guru has to offer and not what Chandra has to offer. Krishnamurti Padhdhati is thus only a
		development of this aspect and a corrective one; it is quite rational and scientific than all the available
		systems of prediction and throws wide scope for study.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Let us now come back to the subject-matter of the query which is about change in occupation of
		the querant. The number mentioned by him is 144 (out of 249). The Zodiac of 12 signs and 27 constellations is
		further sub-divided, according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, into 249 sub-divisions, so much so any part of the
		zodiac will have three planets ruling it, the sign or rasi lord, the constellation lord and the lord of the sub-
		portion of the constellation. On this basis, the number 141 represents that area in the zodiac which lies
		between 28 degrees 46 minutes and 40 seconds in Thula (Libra) and 29 degrees 26 minutes and 40 seconds. As this
		particular area commences at 28 degrees 46 minutes 40 seconds in Thula, this will be the lagna for the query.
		The cusps of the other houses for the query will be drawn by referring to the Table of Houses by Raphael for the
		latitude of the place where the query answered. If 28 degrees 46 minutes 40 seconds in Thula is to be the lagna
		according to the Nirayana of the Indian system, then the Sayana position of the lagna will be 21° 46' 40" added
		by the Ayanamsa, ie.,. 23° 21′ for 1969, ie., 22° 6' 40" Vrischika (Scorpio). A look at the Raphael's Table of
		House, page containing the table for Latitude 28° 40' N which is the latitude of Delhi, will show what the cusps
		of the other houses, namely, 10; 11, 12, 2 and 3 will be according to the Sayana system when 22° 6' 40"; Scorpio
		(Vrischika) rises in the East. The positions of the cusps in Sayana system so obtained will have to be deducted
		by the amount of Ayanamsa for the year under reference so as to get the nirayana positions of the different
		cusps. Thus, for the lagna 28° 46' 40" we get the other cusps of houses as follows:-</p>

		house of the horoscope stands for financial gains; the 6th governs service and the 10th house (Meridian) denotes
		occupation, trade, business, profession etc. In Hindu Astrology, it is said that planets which are in 6, 8 and
		12 to any house do not contribute to the matters influenced by that house; similarly, the houses which are in 6,
		8 and 12 to any house are considered to negate the affairs influenced by the house concerned. On that basis,
		houses 3, 5 and 9 respectively happen to be in 6, 8 and 12 to the house of profession or occupation and
		consequently the planets signifying these houses will contribute, in their conjoint period, to change in
		profession, the native taking leave, etc. (The third house as we all know rules short journeys or journeys to
		nearby places; the 5th house rules pleasurable pursuits; and the ninth house represents journeys to far off
		places and pilgri mage. If one really notes the periods he is running whenever he is on leave temporary absence
		from official duties, he will find these periods governed by the planets which are the significators of houses

	<p class="block_4">Now, before proceeding to analyse, we should find out whether the mind of the querant is
		correctly reflected by the position of the Moon. The Moon for ages has been considered to be the reflector of
		the mind. Its position shows the matter in contemplation in the querant's mind. Chandra now is in Kanya 22 deg.
		33 min., that is, in its own constellation and sub of Sukra. Chandra owns the ninth house and it is a strong
		significator of that house, there being no planet situated in that house or occupying any of the three
		constellations governed by it. Chandra is in the sub of Sukra, who, as lord of 1 and 12, is situated in the 10th
		house. The query is doubly confirmed.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334501" class="block_12">Will there be any change in any occupation to a new one?</h3>
	<p class="block_4">Lord of the 10th house, Surya, who incidentally is also the Karaka for professional matters, is
		situated in the labhasthana in conjunction with Guru owning the 5th house and Chandra owning the 9th house.
		Further Chandra is the lord of the sign of the cusp of the 9th house and Guru is the lord of the constellation
		ruling the cusp of the 9th house. There is bound to be a definite change from your present occupation to a new
		one and it will be a satisfactory one.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334502" class="block_12">If so, will the change bring good to me?</h3>
	<p class="block_4">Lord of 10, Surya, is situated in the 11th house: it occupies the constellation ruled by Mangal
		and the sub of Rahu. What do the planets Mangal and Rahu signify?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mars (Mangal) is a significator of (a) House 2, because it occupies that house as its lord; (b)
		House 6 because it owns it; and (c) Houses 10, 12 and 1 because it is posited in the constellation of Sukra who
		owns lagna and 12th house and occupies 10.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Rahu signifies (a) House 5 as it is in the constellation ruled by Guru, lord of 5; (b) House 4
		which it occupies; and (c) Houses 3 and 6 as it occupies Sani's sign and as such acts as its agent (Sani rules 3
		and is in 6).</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The conjoined influence of Mars and Rahu denotes gain as a result of changes in occupation and
		realisation of ambitions, honour, etc. Unhesitatingly, the native should go in for this change.</p>
	<h3 id="id_Toc184334503" class="block_12">When will this change come about?</h3>
	<p class="block_4">Surya who rules the 10th house of the horary chart, Guru who rules the 5th house and Chandra who
		rules the 9th house and who are conjoined closely at the time of the query also happen to rule the moment: Guru
		as lord of lagna, Chandra as lord of constellation and Surya conjoined to them. Thus, when Surya comes by
		transit to Guru's sign Dhanus, Surya's star Uttarashada and the sub ruled by Chandra, i.e., 27-20-00 to
		28-26-40, on Monday, the 12th January 1970 when the native is running Chandra Dasa, Surya Bhukti Guru Anthra
		(according to the horary chart), he will change. Chandra on that day will transit in the constellation of
		Poorvabhadra owned by Guru, the strongest significator of 5; Chandra also conjoins position occupied by Rahu at
		the time of query; Chandra conjuncts Mangal also. Guru transits in Rahu's star Swathi (Rahu signifying change as
		significator of houses 3 and 5 and representing Sani, lord of the day at the time of query).</p>

	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Going to foreign implies that one has to leave the present permanent place, make a long journey,
		cross his country and reach another. One may return after a short stay or may settle down there. Permanent
		residence is indicated by the 4th house. Leaving it is therefore shown by the 3rd house (12th to 4th). Long
		journey is shown by 9th house. Staying for a short time or settling down in foreign land is denoted by the 12th
		house. It shows new environment and surroundings.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">When we judge any particular house, how to find out whether the matters signified by that house
		will operate or not. If one is to ascertain whether one will change his dwelling place, make a long journey and
		live in a new environment, one is to judge the 12th cusp and find out whether the lord of the sub of 12th cusp
		is either retrograde or deposited in a constellation whose lord is retrograde. If either is retrograde, one
		cannot go abroad. If the sub-lord and the lord of the constellation in which the sub-lord is situated are in
		direct motion and if the sub- lord of the 12th cusp is also a significator of either 3rd or 9th or 12th house,
		one goes abroad,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To cast the horary chart and predict, a number 17 is given within 249. From this number the chart
		cast with the planetary position at the time of judgment in given above.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The 12th cusp in Meena 17° 6' i.c. Jupiter sign, Mercury star and Mercury sub. The sub-lord
		Mercury is not retrograde. It is placed in the constellation of Saturn and Saturn is also not retrograde.
		Further Mercury is posited in the constellation of planet in 12th bhava. Therefore Mercury is a strong
		significator of 12th house. So you are sure to go abroad.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Going abroad need not be on foreign assignment. One may go on tour or for honey-Moon or some
		other purpose. Then how to know whether one goes abroad on a foreign assignment? If any of the significators of
		going abroad is a significator of 6th house also, then one goes abroad on foreign assignment.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Mercury, who is a strong significator of 12th house, is also a significator of 6th house because
		Mercury owns 6th house and there is no planet in 6th bhava and also there is no planet deposited in any of the
		constellations owned by Mercury. Therefore your going abroad will be for 6th house matters. 6th house shows
		service. Therefore you will be going on some foreign assignment.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To ascertain the time of going abroad judge the houses 3, 9 and 12 and find out the
		significators. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">3rd house is occupied by Sun. Jupiter is posited in its star. Jupiter and Kethu are conjoined and
		Rahu occupies Jupiter sign Meena. Therefore Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu are strong significators of 3rd house.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">9th house is unoccupied. Its owner is Jupiter. Rahu is in Jupiter star. Kethu conjoined with
		Jupiter will also give results of 9th house.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">12th bhava is occupied by Saturn. Planets Sun, Mars and Mercury are deposited in the
		constellations owned by Saturn. Kethu occupies Mercury sign Kanya and therefore Kethu will give results of 12th
		house also.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">So the significators of houses 3, 9 and 12 are Jupiter, Rahu, Kethu, Sun, Mars, Mercury and
		Saturn. As the significators are many in number let us find out the ruling planets at this moment of judgment
		because only those planets which are common in the ruling planets and the significators are to be selected as
		beneficial ones. The remaining are to be rejected as they are merely tempters.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The ruling planets are the lords of the day, Moon sign, star and lagna at the moment of judgment.
	</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The day is Saturday ruled by Saturn. The sign transited by Moon is Dhanus owned by Jupiter. The
		star transited by Moon is owned by Kethu The Lagna is Dhanus owned by Jupiter. The nodes Rahu and Kethu
		represent Jupiter. Therefore the ruling planets are Saturn, Jupiter, Rahu and Kethu.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The common planets amongst the significators and ruling planets are Saturn, Jupiter, Rahu and
		Kethu. They will give the result during their conjoined period.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whether your desire will be fulfilled carly or not is to be decided from the owner of 11th house
		and the planets posited in it. Here it is owned by Saturn which indicates delay. Rahu is stronger than Saturn
		because occupant is stronger than owner. Therefore Saturn will delay till Rahu Bhukti commences. In Rahu Bhukti
		your desire will be fulfilled.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Kethu Dasa is already on. In this Rahu Bhukti will start on 7-1-1971. In Kethu Dasa Rahu Bhukti
		you will go either in Jupiter antra or Saturn Antra. Jupiter Antra runs between 4-3-1971 and 24-4-1971 and
		Saturn Antra from 24-4-1971 to 24-6-1971. Which of these two Antras will give?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Jupiter is already represented by Kethu and Rahu (dasa and bhukti lords). Saturn, as owner of
		11th house, is to fulfil the desire. Therefore take the period of Saturn Antra. To know the exact date consider
		the transit of Sun during this period. Sun transits Kethu star Saturn sub in Aries on 28-4-1971. Therefore you
		will go on this date.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whether one goes by sea or by air is to be judged from the sub-lord of 9th cusp. 9th house shows
		long journey. Whether the journey-period will be long or short is indicated by the sub lord of 9th cusp. If the
		sub lord of 9th cusp is a fast moving planet, the journey period will be short indicating thereby that it will
		be an air travel. A slow moving planet as sub lord indicates journey by sea especially when it is deposited in a
		watery sign. In your case the 9th cusp sub lord is Moon who is deposited in Dhanus, a fiery sign. Moon is a fast
		moving planet. Therefore the journey period will be short. Therefore you will go by air.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Whether one will settle permanently in a foreign country or come back after some stay is to be
		decided from the 12th cusp. If the sub lord of 12th cusp is deposited in a common sign, he will go and come
		back. If it is in a movable sign, he will once for all leave the present place and never return. In fixed sign
		it indicates that he will not move out. In your case Mercury is the sub lord of 12th cusp. It is deposited in a
		movable sign. Therefore you will once for all leave the present place and settle permanently in foreign land.

	<p class="block_4">(b)Will I be lucky thereafter? </p>
	<p class="block_4">(c) Where will I go?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Will I move? Note the sub-lord of the 4th house as the fourth house indicates the present place
		of residence. Here the 4th cusp falls in Libra at 8 degrees 42 minutes. The lord of the constellation is in 10
		and the sub-lord Jupiter is in 12. Hence, you will surely move. As the lord of the constellation is the
		significator of the 10th house the cause of moving from one place to the other is only your profession,</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Will I be lucky? Movement will be given by the significators of the third house. If the
		significator of the third house is also the significator of the second, tenth and the eleventh then you will
		have gains in the place to which you move. But if the significator of 3 is also the significator of 8 and 12
		then you will move to lose whatever you have. This is applicable both to the natal and Horary chart.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In Horary chart you have to note the sub of the third house which indicates the change of place.
		If the sub-lord is the significator of 2 or 10 or 11 one will make money and improve his lot. If the sub-lord of
		the third cusp is the significator of 8 and 12 then the move adds more difficulties.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">In your chart the lord of the sub where the third cusp falls, is Mercury. Mercury as lord of 3
		will assist in moving from one place to the other, as lord of 12 it shows life in another place, as the
		depositor of the 10th house, it brings money by business, mostly agency, and being in the constellation of Sun,
		lord of 2 in 11 promises profit, social and financial success. Hence you will move and you will be lucky.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Where will I go? As the sub-lord is Mercury, you will go to one place first; not finding that it
		is no good, you will further move. Plurality is indicated by Mercury.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">To find out this one has to refer to the periods-dasa, bhukti. Now you are running, according to
		the horary chart, Saturn Dasa Saturn Bhukti. It is lord of 6 and 7 deposited in the 8th house in its own star
		and sub. Hence during Saturn Bhukti you must continue to stay here. Only when Mercury Bhukti starts, you will
		go. It will be after 7th June, 1968.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Oh, God. Everyday is a hell. How can I pass two years. Nowadays I do not have telephone to avoid
		the unpleasant conversation with those who demand their money back. Also I go late home to avoid the fellows who
		come to my house to demand money. I allow my wife to go to bed and then I reach home. How long can I manage.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Generally people are depressed and they become despondent. Somehow they manage. The Sun counts
		the year. When good time comes one begins to enjoy.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Will I commit suicide by drowning?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">No, you will not die. You will borrow more money from others and be drowned in debts only.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Alright. If at all I go where will I go? </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">The third cusp shows only the moment. But it is the 12th cusp which indicates the place of your
		stay outside. As the 12th cusp falls in Gemini in Rahu star Jupiter sub, it will be a twin city and it will be
		HYDERABAD, SECUNDERABAD. </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">Thanks, sir.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">(This person did not meet me later. I was happy that he would not borrow from me also. In 1969
		when I went to In 1969 Hyderabad I met him. He told that he was pulling on there since a few months. When I
		asked him to give his address, he told that if he were to give his address, I might in any casual talk mention
		about this prediction and the creditors would chase him. So he said that he was temporarily put up with a friend
		of his and avoided giving a straight answer.)</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334507" class="block_12">Can I have a press of my own to publish books?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">Press is indicated by Mars, Mercury and Jupiter. Therefore, if the sub-lord of the meridian is
		deposited in the constellation of a planet which is the significator of at least one of the three houses 2, 6
		and 10 and also if it is in any manner connected with Mars and Mercury, one will have one's own press.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334508" class="block_12">Will I have satisfactory spiritual life?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">The 5th house in the horoscope indicates the initiation for the mantra; the 10th house shows how
		he will be practising, regularly or not and the 11th house indicates his attainments here. One is to find out
		the sub-lord of the IIth: if it is deposited in the constellation of a planet who is the significator of 5 and
		10, one will surely have the satisfaction in the spiritual life. Siddhi is indicated.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334509" class="block_12">Can I become a Sanyasi?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">By Sanyasi it is meant that one gives up this worldly pleasu- rers and possessions and cares more
		for paralokasadhanam. He severs connection from the family and a new cycle of life starts. In Horary Astrology,
		one can become a Sanyasi only when the sub-lord of the Ascendant is connected with the houses 3, 10 and 12 and
		it is in any manner connected with Saturn,</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc184334510" class="block_12">Any re-appointment for me?</h2>
	<p class="block_4">This question is to be taken just like that asked by a young person whether he will get into
		service at all, if so, when? Re-appointment means that he has completed one service and severed connection with
		it. Now he is seeking for another. Therefore it should be taken as though it is a new appointment then judge 6th
		cusp. The sub-lord of the 6th cusp is to be deposited in the constellation, the lord of which is the
		significator of the 6th or 10th or 2nd then he will be re-appointed. But if the sub-lord is in the constellation
		lord of which is the significator of 1 or 5 or 9 or 12th house he will not be re-appointed.</p>
